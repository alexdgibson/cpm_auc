1,"39241307","Head-to-head comparison of contrast-enhanced CT, dual-layer spectral-detector CT, and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR in detecting neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases.","To explore the optimal of kiloelectron voltage (keV) of virtual monoenergetic imaging (VMI) of dual-layer spectral-detector CT (DLCT) in detecting neuroendocrine tumor liver metastases (NETLM) and to investigate diagnostic performance of polyenergetic images (PEI), DLCT, and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR. Seventy-two patients with suspected NETLM who underwent DLCT and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR were retrospectively enrolled. Tumor signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR) were compared between PEI and VMI at 40-140 keV. Two radiologists read the CT examinations with and without VMI separately in consensus. Two other radiologists read the Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR in consensus. The diagnostic performance was evaluated. Reference standard was histopathology, follow-up, and interpretation of all available imaging. The highest SNR and CNR were observed at VMI40keV, significantly higher than PEI in the arterial and venous phases (all P<0.01). A total of 477 lesions were identified (396 metastases, 81 benign lesions). Per-lesion AUC was 0.86, 0.91, and 0.97 (PEI, DLCT, and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR, respectively). Sensitivity of PEI, DLCT, and Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MRI were 0.76, 0.86, and 0.95, respectively. DLCT significantly improved sensitivity compared to PEI. MR had significantly higher sensitivity than DLCT and PEI. Subgroup analysis demonstrated that the difference in diagnostic performance was concentrated on lesions < 10 mm. The image quality of VMI40keV is higher than that of PEI. DLCT with VMI40keV provides better diagnostic sensitivity for NETLM detection than PEI. Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced MR yielded the best diagnostic performance for NETLM detection.","2024","European journal of radiology"

We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent lung resections for lung cancer, and developed a risk model using data from 2014 to 2017 (training dataset), validated using data from 2018 to 2019 (validation dataset). Forty variables were analyzed, including 35 factors related to the patient's overall condition and five factors related to surgical techniques and tumor-related factors. The risk model for postoperative complications was developed using an elastic net regularized generalized linear model. The performance of the risk model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and compared with the Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI). The rate of postoperative complications was 34.7% in the training dataset and 21.9% in the validation dataset. The final model consisted of 20 variables, including age, surgical-related factors, respiratory function tests, and comorbidities, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of ischemic heart disease, and 12 blood test results. The area under the curve (AUC) for the developed risk model was 0.734, whereas the AUC for the CCI was 0.521 in the validation dataset. The new machine learning model could predict postoperative complications with acceptable accuracy. 2020-0375.","2024","Surgery today"

Twenty-three older adults (mean age 73.7 ± 13.2 years) with cognitive decline were enrolled. Thermal images of four facial views were taken using a smartphone-connected thermal camera. Intra-oral examinations were conducted, and the thermographic data were analyzed to extract temperature values in the regions of interest (ROI). Point-biserial correlations and ROC curve analyses were performed to evaluate associations between temperature data and clinical findings, with a significance level of p < 0.05. Intra-oral issues requiring treatment were found in 12 participants, with six reporting clinical pain. The overall mean temperature in the ROI was 33.5 ± 3.9 °C, and significant temperature differences were found between the body and ROI temperatures. Correlations were observed between clinical problems and various temperature metrics, including the minimum and maximum ROI temperatures (rpb=-0.327, p = 0.002 and rpb=-0.309, p = 0.003). ROC analysis indicated that ROI temperature could predict the presence or absence of clinical problems, with AUC values ranging from 0.651 to 0.796 for different metrics. Thermographic facial imaging shows significant potential as a non-invasive tool for detecting oral health problems in vulnerable older adults. While promising, further research is essential to enhance image quality, streamline the technique, and incorporate AI for improved diagnostic accuracy and ease of use. This non-invasive, inexpensive technique is easy to perform, independent of patient compliance and, is promising to detect early oral problems in noncommunicative patients.","2025","Journal of dentistry"

However, the susceptibility of specific regions to different flood types remains unexplored. To the best of our knowledge for the first time, this study employed an integrated approach by leveraging a GIS-based Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), remote sensing, and machine learning (ML) algorithms, to assess susceptibility to three different types of flooding in Peshawar, Pakistan. The study first evaluated the degree of susceptibility to riverine, urban, and flash floods using the GIS-based AHP technique, and then employed ML models, (i.e., specifically Random Forest [RF] and Extreme Gradient Boosting [XG-Boost] to analyze multi-type flood susceptibility in the study region. The performance of the ML models was also evaluated, and the XG-Boost model outperforms RF, demonstrating a higher correlation coefficient (R2 = 0.561-0.922) and lower mean absolute error (MAE = 0.042-0.354), and root-mean-square error (RMSE = 0.119-0.415) for both training and testing datasets. The superior performance of the XG-Boost was further confirmed by the higher value of the area under the curve (AUC) values, which is relatively higher (0.87) than that of the AHP (0.70) and RF (0.86) models. Based on the relative best performance, the XG-Boost model was chosen for further susceptibility assessment of different types of floods, and the generated flood susceptibility maps revealed that 20.9% of the total area is susceptible to riverine flooding, while 30.27% and 48.68% of the total area is susceptible to urban and flash flooding, respectively. The study's findings are significant, offering valuable insights for relevant stakeholders in guiding future flood risk management and sustainable land use plans in the study area.","2024","Journal of environmental management"

This study aims to develop a predictive model for CLNM in PTC patients using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and clinicopathological data. By incorporating deep learning (DL) algorithms, the model seeks to address the challenges in diagnosing CLNM and reduce overtreatment. The results were compared with traditional machine learning (ML) models. In this retrospective study, preoperative MRI data from 105 PTC patients were divided into training and testing sets. A radiologist manually outlined the region of interest (ROI) on MRI images. Three classic ML algorithms (support vector machine [SVM], logistic regression [LR], and random forest [RF]) were employed across different data modalities. Additionally, an AMMCNet utilizing convolutional neural networks (CNNs) was proposed to develop DL models for CLNM. Predictive performance was evaluated using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and clinical utility was assessed through decision curve analysis (DCA). Lesion diameter was identified as an independent risk factor for CLNM. Among ML models, the RF-(T1WI + T2WI, T1WI + T2WI + Clinical) models achieved the highest area under the curve (AUC) at 0.863. The DL fusion model surpassed all ML fusion models with an AUC of 0.891. A fusion model based on the AMMCNet architecture using MRI images and clinicopathological data was developed, effectively predicting CLNM in PTC patients.","2024","Cancers"

Our main objective was to assess the potential benefit of hypoxic burden to identify obesity-related sleep hypoventilation. We hypothesized that hypoxic burden may help diagnose obesity-related sleep hypoventilation better than usual sleep respiratory measures (i.e., apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), mean SpO2, time with SpO2 < 90 %). This retrospective study was conducted from June 2022 to October 2023 at the University Hospital of Rouen, France. All consecutive obese patients (BMI ≥30 kg/m2), adults, with no other respiratory or neurological diseases who underwent a polysomnography or polygraphy with concomitant capnography were included. Sleep hypoventilation was defined according to American Academy of Sleep Medicine criteria based on transcutaneous CO2 monitoring (PtcCO2). Diagnostic performance of sleep-related respiratory measures i.e., sleep apnea-specific hypoxic burden, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI), mean SpO2, time with SpO2 < 90 % was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. Correlations between sleep-related respiratory measures were assessed by a Spearman correlation matrix. Among 107 obese patients with analyzed capnography, 37 (35 %) had sleep hypoventilation. Patients were 53 ± 14 years old, mean BMI = 38 ± 6 kg/m2, mean AHI = 26.5 ± 25/h, mean hypoxic burden = 67 ± 109 %min/h, mean SpO2 = 91.5 ± 3 %, mean time with SpO2<90 % = 19.4 ± 28 %, mean PtcCO2 = 6.2 ± 0.7 kPa. A low positive correlation was found between hypoxic burden and mean PtcCO2 (r = 0.4, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression model explaining sleep hypoventilation was insufficient with area under ROC curve of hypoxic burden estimated at 0.74 (95 % CI 0.65 to 0.84). Hypoxic burden has low correlation with transcutaneous CO2 pressure and a low ability to diagnose obesity-related sleep hypoventilation.","2024","Sleep medicine"

Identification of new biomarkers related to survival may help guide discovery of new pathophysiologic pathways and potential therapeutic targets. As long-chain ceramides have been linked to tumor proliferation, we sought to determine if ceramide levels were prognostic in PDAC. Patients from two phase I studies of PDAC were followed for all-cause mortality. Ceramide levels (C24:0, C22:0, and C16:0) were quantified before treatment and at study intervals. Multivariable Cox regression models assessed the association of ceramide levels and mortality after adjusting for other univariable predictors, including time-dependent tumor resection. The ability of repeated ceramide measures to discriminate patients at risk for mortality was also assessed using multivariable modeling and the c-statistic. Higher plasma C16:0 concentration was associated with higher all-cause mortality in univariable and multivariable analysis (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR] 1.41, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.09-1.82; p < 0.01). In contrast, a higher plasma C24:0/C16:0 ratio was associated with lower all-cause mortality in multivariable analysis (aHR 0.69, 95% CI 0.49-0.97; p = 0.032). Discrimination of mortality was significantly improved with the addition of either plasma C16:0 or C24:0/C16:0 levels, with optimal discrimination occurring using repeated measures of the C24:0/C16:0 ratio (c-statistic 0.73 vs. c-statistic 0.66; p < 0.001). Higher plasma C16:0 and lower C24:0/C16:0 ratios are independently associated with mortality in PDAC and show an ability to improve discrimination of mortality in this deadly disease. Further studies are needed to confirm this association and evaluate this novel pathway for potential therapeutic targets.","2024","Annals of surgical oncology"

We conducted a retrospective evaluation of patients who underwent surgery and received standardized ultrasound examinations due to the presence of uterine myoma-like masses. Histological diagnosis was used as the reference standard. The masses were analyzed using morphological uterus sonographic assessment criteria, and the diagnostic accuracy of PRESS-US was evaluated using ROC curve analysis. Kappa (κ) statistics were used to assess the inter-observer agreement between a less experienced and an expert radiologist. Among the 646 patients, 632 (97.8%) were diagnosed with LM, and 14 (2.2%) had uLMS. The malignancy rates for low-risk and high-risk patients were 0.35% and 13.48%, respectively. The optimal PRESS-US cutoff was 17.5, resulting in an AUC of 89.7% (95% CI, 0.79-1.00), with a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 87.8%. The inter-observer agreement between a less experienced and an expert radiologist was excellent (κ = 0.811, P < 0.001). PRESS-US provides effective risk stratification for uLMS for radiologists with different levels of experience, with high reliability. Subgrouping high-risk patients helps in better risk stratification.","2024","La Radiologia medica"

Discharge from ICU needs to consider the reason for admission and stability after ICU care. Organ dysfunction or instability after ICU discharge constitute potentially life-threatening situations for patients. This is a single center, observational, retrospective cohort study conducted at ICUs at the Kepler University Hospital in Linz, Austria. Patients aged 18 years and above admitted to the study center's ICUs between 2010-01-01 and 2019-10-31 were included in the study. Patients transferred to another ICU, discharged to a different hospital or home, or that died during their ICU stay were excluded. We used machine learning (ML) models to predict unplanned ICU readmission or death using an internal dataset or MIMIC-IV as training data and compared the models with the Stability and Workload Index for Transfer (SWIFT) score. Further, we evaluated the influence of features on the models using Shapley Additive Explanations. The best ML models achieved an area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) of 0.721 ± 0.029 and a high negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.990 ± 0.002. The most important features were heart rate, peripheral oxygen saturation and arterial blood pressure. Performance of the SWIFT score was worse than the ML models (best AUC-ROC 0.618 ± 0.011). ML models were able to identify patients that will not need unplanned ICU readmission and will not die within 48 h after discharge.","2024","Journal of clinical anesthesia"

The analysis is performed on chest X-rays as a case study and encompasses a comprehensive model performance definition, considering both discriminative capabilities and model calibration. We conduct a concise literature review to examine prevailing scientific practices used when evaluating X-ray classifiers. Then, we perform a systematic experiment on two major chest X-ray datasets to showcase a didactic example of the behavior of several performance metrics under different class ratios and highlight how widely adopted metrics can conceal performance in the minority class. Our literature study confirms that: (1) even when dealing with highly imbalanced datasets, the community tends to use metrics that are dominated by the majority class; and (2) it is still uncommon to include calibration studies for chest X-ray classifiers, albeit its importance in the context of healthcare. Moreover, our systematic experiments confirm that current evaluation practices may not reflect model performance in real clinical scenarios and suggest complementary metrics to better reflect the performance of the system in such scenarios. Our analysis underscores the need for enhanced evaluation practices, particularly in the context of class-imbalanced chest X-ray classifiers. We recommend the inclusion of complementary metrics such as the area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR), adjusted AUC-PR, and balanced Brier score, to offer a more accurate depiction of system performance in real clinical scenarios, considering metrics that reflect both, discrimination and calibration performance. This study underscores the critical need for refined evaluation metrics in medical imaging classifiers, emphasizing that prevalent metrics may mask poor performance in minority classes, potentially impacting clinical diagnoses and healthcare outcomes. Common scientific practices in papers dealing with X-ray computer-assisted diagnosis (CAD) systems may be misleading. We highlight limitations in reporting of evaluation metrics for X-ray CAD systems in highly imbalanced scenarios. We propose adopting alternative metrics based on experimental evaluation on large-scale datasets.","2024","European radiology"

Chronic hepatitis B virus infection (CHB) is considered as a leading cause to bring about HCC in China. Serum albumin (ALB) level has been adopted to verify its risk with HCC development as a combination variable with other factors. However, the predictive value of a single ALB level on HBV-related HCC risk remained unclear. The aim of this study was to evaluate the prediction ability of serum ALB concentration on the risk of HBV-related HCC development. A prospectively enrolled clinical cohort compromising 2932 cases of CHB patients with at least 1-year exclusion window was selected to explore the predictive role of serum ALB level on incident HCC risk. Baseline clinical data including host characters and laboratory test were collected at the initial period of hospitalisation. The hazard ratio of ALB level associated with HCC development was assessed by Cox proportional hazards regression model using univariate and multivariate analyses. We evaluated the discrimination accuracy of ALB level in predicting HCC development by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Dose-dependent and time-dependent effects of ALB level on HCC risk prediction were demonstrated, respectively, using a restricted cubic spline and a Fine and Grey competing risk model. Referred to patients with higher ALB level, those with lower ALB level exhibited significantly increased risk of HCC development after adjustment for host variables (dichotomised analyses: hazard ratio = 3.12, 95% confidence interval 1.63-5.97, p = 8.23 × 10-4, plog-rank = 5.97 × 10-4; tertile analyses: hazard ratio = 2.07, 95% confidence interval 1.63-2.64, p = 3.77 × 10-9, plog-rank < 2.00 × 10-16; quartile analyses: hazard ratio = 2.10, 95% confidence interval 1.56-2.84, p = 9.87 × 10-7, plog-rank < 2.00 × 10-16). There was a statistically increasing trend on HCC risk which was found following by the decrease of ALB level (ptrend < 0.0001). Similar findings were present by the Kaplan-Meier analysis, cumulative incidences of HCC development were significantly higher in patients with lower ALB levels, with the p value obtained from log-rank test were all < 0.0001. The result of dose-dependent effect showed hazard ratio (HR) value of HCC risk was gradually decreasing as the increasing of ALB level, with non-linear correlation being statistically significant (Wald χ2 = 20.59, p = 0.000). HR value in lower ALB level remained persistently prominent by fluctuating around 2.73 in the whole follow-up time by adjusting for host variables. Sub-cohort analysis by ROC revealed that the discrimination ability of the ALB model was performed better than Child-Pugh (C-P) model in both cohort of patients with 1-year (area under curve [AUC] 0.762 vs. 0.720) and 2-year exclusion window (AUC 0.768 vs. 0.728). The AUC added by ALB level was demonstrated significantly from host model to full model. Lower ALB level was significantly associated with an increased risk of HBV-related HCC and could provide extra useful clinical utility to other host features, which might be a promising non-invasive indicator for surveillance on HCC development.","2024","Journal of viral hepatitis"

We aimed to predict prognosis based on ER stress related key genes. Data of the RNA-seq and clinical information of breast cancer cases were downloaded from the TCGA database. A total of 4 genes related with ER stress was identified by the univariate Cox regression and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO)-penalized Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. The predictive ability of the ER stress model was evaluated by utilizing Kaplan-Meier curves and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Moreover, we verified 4 genes expression and its relationship with clinical breast cancer cases in real-world. 4 genes including RNF186, BCAP31, SERPINA1, TAPBP were identified as a prognostic risk score model. Based on that, we found patients of breast cancer had a better survival with low-risk score. And also, ER stress model showed a good diagnostic efficacy with AUC curve. The risk score was significantly associated with patients' age, T stage and clinical stage. A nomogram was constructed to estimate individual survival. Further GO and KEGG analysis showed our model was related with immune infiltration. Patients of breast cancer with high-risk scores were usually accompanied with poor immune infiltration. It was predicted that high risk group was more sensitive to Vinorelbine, Docetaxel and Cisplatin. At last, we verified the expression of four signature genes using qRT-PCR and immunohistochemistry.

Presenting binocular distance visual acuity (VA), near VA, and contrast sensitivity (CS) were assessed. Objective VI was defined as having VI in distance VA (worse than 20/40), near VA (worse than 20/40), or CS (worse than 1.55 logCS). Receiver operating characteristic analysis was used to compare performance of VD in predicting VI. To investigate factors that influence discordance, we limited our sample to adults with VI and used a multivariable logistic regression model to identify factors associated with not reporting VD. Similar analyses were performed to explore factors associated with reporting VD in adults without VI. Discordance factors. Four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine adults were included in the 2022 cohort.

Despite advancements in early diagnosis through high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) screening, challenges remain in predicting and treating the disease. Hence, the identification of novel biomarkers for prognosis and therapeutic targets is crucial. CENPE, a microtubule-end directed motor protein that accumulates during the G2 phase, is recognized for its involvement in promoting cancer growth and progression. However, its specific role in CESC remains unclear. This research investigated the expression of CENPE in CESC utilizing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), which was further validated through gene expression profiles, the Human Protein Atlas (HPA), and clinical data. The study utilized Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and immune infiltration analysis to elucidate the role of CENPE in CESC. Additionally, Protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks and competing endogenous RNA (CeRNA) networks involving CENPE and its differentially expressed genes were established. Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was conducted to evaluate the impact of CENPE on patient prognosis. Our study revealed an upregulation of CENPE expression in cervical cancer tissues, which promotes the progression of CESC through IL-6-mediated PI3K-Akt and MAPK signaling pathways. The significant associations with ACNG3, LY6H, and SLC6A7 suggest that CENPE may play a role in tumor growth and metastasis, potentially involving the nervous system. Moreover, the correlations with ARIH1, KDM1A, KDM5B, and NSD3 indicate that CENPE could be a promising target for drug development. Our analysis of the ROC curve demonstrated a high diagnostic accuracy of CENPE in CESC (AUC: 0.997, CI: 0.990-1.000). Subgroup analysis highlighted substantial effects in patients under 50 years old, those with a height under 160 cm, individuals in peri- and post-menopausal stages, and patients in clinical stages 1 and 4. Additionally, COX regression analysis indicated that older age, lower BMI, and higher CENPE expression are associated with decreased 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year survival rates. In conclusion, CENPE emerges as a crucial factor in the initiation and advancement of cervical cancer, showing potential as a novel target for therapeutic interventions.","2024","Heliyon"

This was a prospective multicenter observational study. We considered all patients with suspected primary ovarian/tubal/peritoneal cancer who underwent preoperative ultrasound, CT, and WB-DWI/MRI (if available). The optimal cut off value for assessing the performance of the methods in predicting non-resectability was identified at the point at which the sensitivity and specificity were most similar. The reference standard to predict non-resectability was surgical outcome in terms of residual disease >1 cm or surgery not feasible. Agreement between imaging methods and surgical exploration in assessing sites included in the PCI score was evaluated using the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). 242 patients were included from January 2020 until November 2022. The optimal PCI cut-off for predicting non-resectability for surgical exploration was >12, which achieved the best AUC of 0.87, followed by ultrasound with a cut-off of >10 and AUC of 0.81, WB-DWI/MRI with a cut-off of >12 and AUC of 0.81, and CT with a cut-off of >11 and AUC of 0.74. Using ICC, ultrasound had very high agreement (0.94) with surgical PCI, while CT and WB-DWI/MRI had high agreement (0.86 and 0.87, respectively). Ultrasound performed by an expert operator had the best agreement with surgical findings compared to WB-DWI/MRI and CT in assessing radiological PCI. In predicting non-resectability, ultrasound was non-inferior to CT, while its non-inferiority to WB-DWI/MRI was not demonstrated.","2024","Gynecologic oncology"

Leveraging a curated immune evasion-related gene set from Lawson et al., we employed the LASSO algorithm and Cox regression analysis to identify eight genes (LPAR6, RGS5, NFYC, PCDH17, CENPW, CNOT8, FOXO3, SNRPB) significantly associated with immune therapy prognosis (HR, 3.57; 95 % CI, 2.38-5.35; P<0.001). A predictive algorithm developed utilizing these genes exhibited notable accuracy in forecasting patients' progression-free survival in the training set (AUC, 0.835). Furthermore, stratification of patients by risk score revealed discernible differences in immunotherapy response and tumor microenvironment. In summary, we present a prognostic model intricately linked with immune status and treatment response. For ccRCC patients undergoing immunotherapy, this approach holds promise in aiding clinical decision-making by providing more precise and tailored treatment recommendations.","2024","International immunopharmacology"

The aim of this study is to identify the potential molecular mechanism of abnormal methylation-modified DNA in the progression of IDD, hoping to contribute to the diagnosis and management of IDD. Low-grade IDD (grade I-II) and high-grade IDD (grade III-V) data were downloaded from GSE70362 and GSE129789 datasets. The abnormally methylated modified differentially expressed mRNAs (DEmRNAs) were identified by differential expression analysis (screening criteria were p < .05 and |logFC| > 1) and differential methylation analysis (screening criteria were p < .05 and |δβ| > 0.1). The classification models were constructed, and the receiver operating characteristic analysis was also carried out. In addition, functional enrichment analysis and immune correlation analysis were performed and the miRNAs targeted for the abnormally methylated DEmRNAs were predicted. Finally, expression validation was performed using real-time PCR. Compared with low-grade IDD, seven abnormal methylation-modified DEmRNAs (AOX1, IBSP, QDPR, ABLIM1, CRISPLD2, ACTC1 and EMILIN1) were identified in high-grade IDD, and the classification models of random forests (RF) and support vector machine (SVM) were constructed. Moreover, seven abnormal methylation-modified DEmRNAs and classification models have high diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.8). We also found that AUC values of single abnormal methylation-modified DEmRNA were all lower than those of RF and SVM classification models. Pearson correlation analysis found that macrophages M2 and EMILIN1 had significant negative correlation, while macrophages M2 and IBSP had significant positive correlation. In addition, four targeted relationship pairs (hsa-miR-4728-5p-QDPR, hsa-miR-4533-ABLIM1, hsa-miR-4728-5p-ABLIM1 and hsa-miR-4534-CRISPLD2) and multiple signalling pathways (for example, PI3K-AKT signalling pathway, osteoclast differentiation and calcium signalling pathway) were also identified that may be involved in the progression of IDD. The identification of abnormal methylation-modified DEmRNAs and the construction of classification models in this study were helpful for the diagnosis and management of IDD progression.","2024","Annals of medicine"

However, there is a significant challenge in identifying tumors with non-mutational p53 inactivation which is not detectable through DNA sequencing. These undetected cases are often misclassified as p53-normal, leading to inaccurate prognosis and downstream association analyses. To address this issue, we built the support vector machine (SVM) models to systematically reassess p53's functional statuses in TP53 wild-type (TP53WT) tumors from multiple The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) cohorts. Cross-validation demonstrated the good performance of the SVM models with a mean area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.9822, precision of 0.9747, and recall of 0.9784. Our study revealed that a significant proportion (87%-99%) of TP53WT tumors actually had compromised p53 function. Additional analyses uncovered that these genetically intact but functionally impaired (termed as predictively reduced function of p53 or TP53WT-pRF) tumors exhibited genomic and pathophysiologic features akin to TP53-mutant tumors: heightened genomic instability and elevated levels of hypoxia. Clinically, patients with TP53WT-pRF tumors experienced significantly shortened overall survival or progression-free survival compared to those with predictively normal function of p53 (TP53WT-pN) tumors, and these patients also displayed increased sensitivity to platinum-based chemotherapy and radiation therapy.","2024","Genomics, proteomics & bioinformatics"

There is a lack of prediction models for  preeclampsia and adverse pregnancy outcomes in pregnant women with CKD. This study aimed to create a prediction nomogram for these issues. This retrospective cohort study included clinical data from 627 women with CKD and their 627 pregnancies at Peking University First Hospital between January 1, 2009, and December 31, 2022. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify independent prognostic factors and develop a nomogram for predicting the occurrence of preeclampsia. The identified risk factors were utilised to construct the nomogram, which was subsequently internally validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and calibration curve assessment. According to our multivariate analysis, age, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), serum creatinine (Scr), mean arterial pressure (MAP), 24-h proteinuria, and CKD stage were identified as predictors of preeclampsia. Additionally, Scr, MAP, BUN, and 24-h proteinuria were found to be predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes. The nomogram for predicting preeclampsia had an area under the ROC curve of 0.910, while the nomogram for predicting adverse pregnancy outcomes had an area under the ROC curve of 0.906. Both models demonstrated excellent discriminatory ability. A nomogram based on 24-h proteinuria, serum creatinine, serum urea and age, and MAP allows predicting the occurrence of preeclampsia and other adverse pregnancy-related outcomes in CKD patients.","2024","Journal of nephrology"

It is necessary to determine the best data for predicting multidimensional vulnerability (i.e. risk factors to vulnerability across different domains and a lack of protective factors) at population level to understand national prevalence and trends. This study aimed to (1) assess the feasibility of predicting multidimensional vulnerability during pregnancy using routinely collected data, (2) explore potential improvement of these predictions by adding self-reported data on health, well-being, and lifestyle, and (3) identify the most relevant predictors. The study was conducted using Dutch nationwide routinely collected data and self-reported Public Health Monitor data. First, to predict multidimensional vulnerability using routinely collected data, we used random forest (RF) and considered the area under the curve (AUC) and F1 measure to assess RF model performance. To validate results, sensitivity analyses (XGBoost and Lasso) were done. Second, we gradually added self-reported data to predictions. Third, we explored the RF model's variable importance. The initial RF model could distinguish between those with and without multidimensional vulnerability (AUC = 0.98). The model was able to correctly predict multidimensional vulnerability in most cases, but there was also misclassification (F1 measure = 0.70). Adding self-reported data improved RF model performance (e.g. F1 measure = 0.80 after adding perceived health). The strongest predictors concerned self-reported health, socioeconomic characteristics, and healthcare expenditures and utilization. It seems possible to predict multidimensional vulnerability using routinely collected data that is readily available. However, adding self-reported data can improve predictions.","2024","European journal of public health"

In this study, we evaluated various methods for binary and multiclass classification. Among them, the GA-SVM-SVM:GA-SVM-SVM model was selected with an accuracy of 0.74, an F1-score of 0.73, and an AUC of 0.92 for virtual screening of ligands from the BindingDB database. This model successfully identified 4454, 803, 438, and 378 ligands with over 90% precision in both active/inactive and target prediction for the classes of EGFR+HER2, ER, NF-κB, and PR, respectively, from the BindingDB database. Based on to the selected ligands, we created a dendrogram that categorizes different ligands based on their targets. This dendrogram aims to facilitate the exploration of chemical space for various therapeutic targets. Ligands that surpassed a 90% threshold in the product of activity probability and correct target selection probability were chosen for further investigation using molecular docking. The binding energy range for these ligands against their respective targets was calculated to be between -15 and -5 kcal/mol.

Cerebral malaria (CM) is the most severe and deadly manifestation of the disease. The occurrence of multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS) has been associated with increased mortality in adult patients with CM. However, little is known about the frequency and severity of MODS in children with CM. This was a retrospective study of 199 pediatric patients with CM admitted to a referral hospital in Blantyre, Malawi, between January 2019 and May 2023. Data were abstracted from charts to calculate scores using four established scoring systems: Pediatric Logistic Organ Dysfunction-2 (PELOD-2), Pediatric Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (pSOFA), Signs of Inflammation in Children that Can Kill (SICK), and Lambaréné Organ Dysfunction Score (LODS). Mortality was 16% (n = 32). All four scoring systems were predictive of mortality, but the PELOD-2 and pSOFA scores outperformed the others with area under the curve values of 0.75 and 0.67, respectively. Multiple organ dysfunction syndrome was diagnosed in 182 patients (91%) using the PELOD-2 score, 172 patients (86%) using the pSOFA score, 99 patients (50%) using the SICK score, and 30 patients (15%) using the LODS. The PELOD-2 and pSOFA identify MODS in children with CM but require laboratory-based testing that is often unavailable in malaria-endemic areas. Furthermore, these scoring systems may identify primary malarial disease pathology rather than true organ dysfunction. Simplified scoring systems designed to recognize and quantify MODS in this patient population may provide opportunities for improved resource allocation and timely, organ-specific treatment.","2024","The American journal of tropical medicine and hygiene"

Genetic alteration screening for all ICC patients is of high cost and not routinely performed. This study intends to develop a histopathology-based artificial intelligence (AI)-assisted system for predicting genetic alteration of ICC. We constructed a Genetic Alteration Prediction (GAP) system based on multi-instance learning and self-supervised learning to predict genetic alterations using whole-slide images (WSIs) of H&E-stained slides. A total of 2069 WSIs from 232 ICC patients underwent surgery of the FAH-SYSU dataset were used for model construction and adjustment by five-fold cross-validation. Another 150 patients from three medical centres were used as independent external validations. We also compared the cost-effectiveness of GAP-assisted precise treatment and all-sequencing strategy to non-sequencing strategy. The GAP was able to predict actionable genetic alterations of ICC, including FGFR2 and IDH. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) for FGFR2 and IDH were 0.754 and 0.713 in the internal dataset, and 0.724 and 0.656 in the external dataset, respectively. Furthermore, compared to giving chemotherapy without sequencing for every patient, GAP-assisted precise treatment could increase 1 progression-free quality-adjusted life month with a cost of $13871.72, the co-responding figure for all-sequencing strategy is $44538.93.

The general information and biochemical indicators of the participants were collected to assess the risk factors for GLP-1RA-related GISEs, and multifactorial logistic regression analysis was used to obtain the best predictors. A nomogram prediction model was constructed. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test was used to assess the differentiation and calibration of the nomogram model, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical utility of the model. Age, gender, history of gastrointestinal disorders, and number of combined oral medications were found as risk factors for the occurrence of GISEs in patients with T2DM using GLP-1RAs (p < 0.05).

In this prospective cohort study, data from patients with migraine who had received anti-CGRP mAbs for 12 months were collected. Demographic and monthly clinical variables were collected, including monthly headache days (MHDs), days with acute medication use, number of analgesics and Headache Impact Test-6. Response rates were categorized as <25%, 26-50%, 51-75% and >75% reduction in MHDs. ML models were trained using random forest algorithm and optimized to maximize the F1 score. ML model performance was also evaluated using standard evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Sequential backward feature selection was employed to identify the most relevant predictors for each model. Each model was given 11 baseline data inputs and month-based predictors for months 1, 3 and 6. Each model was then validated against an external test cohort of patients who had received anti-CGRP mAbs for 12 months. Three hundred thirty-six patients treated with anti-CGRP mAbs were included. The external cohort included 93 patients treated with anti-CGRP mAbs. We developed six models to predict 3- 6- and 12-month responses using early predictors. ML-based models yielded predictions with an accuracy score in the range 0.40-0.73 and an AUC-ROC score in the range 0.56-0.76 during internal testing and yielding predictions with an accuracy in the range 0.39-0.64 and an AUC-ROC score in the range 0.52-0.78 when tested against an external test cohort. Shapley Additive explanations summary plots were generated to interpret the contribution of each feature for each model. Based on these findings, a response prediction tool was developed. Each model was run through a backward feature selection to find the most relevant features for the models. The MHDs reduction of the previous data point tends to be the most relevant, while the migraine with aura indicator tends to be the least effective predictor. The response prediction tool utilizing evolving ML-based models holds promise in the early prediction of treatment outcomes for patients with migraine undergoing anti-CGRP mAbs treatment.","2024","Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache"

We assessed the diagnostic utility of 3 serum biomarkers in the early detection of systemic envenoming in viper bites in rural Sri Lanka. All confirmed snakebite patients admitted to Teaching Hospital Anuradhapura from July 2020 to June 2021 were included. On admission, blood was collected for venom concentrations, prothrombin time/international normalized ratio, fibrinogen concentration, serum creatinine concentration, and 3 serum biomarkers, namely secretory phospholipase A2 (sPLA2) activity, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (sNGAL) concentration, and clusterin (sClu) concentration. Systemic envenoming was defined by the presence of venom-induced consumption coagulopathy, neurotoxicity, acute kidney injury, or the presence of nonspecific clinical effects. A total of 237 confirmed snakebite patients (Russell's viper, 72; hump-nosed viper, 80; nonvenomous snakes, 31; and unidentified bites, 54) with sufficient preantivenom serum samples were recruited [median age: 42 years (interquartile range [IQR] 29 to 53 years); 173 men (73%)]. Systemic envenoming occurred in 68 (94%) Russell's viper bites, 48 (60%) hump-nosed viper bites, and 45 (83%) unidentified bites. The median sPLA2 activity was 72 nmol/mL/min (IQR 30 to 164) for Russell's viper envenoming, 12 nmol/mL/min (IQR 9 to 16) for hump-nosed viper envenoming, and 11 nmol/mL/min (IQR 9 to 14) for nonvenomous bites. There was no difference in sNGAL and sCLu concentrations among the 3 groups. The median sPLA2 activity of patients with systemic envenoming was 16 nmol/min/mL (IQR 11 to 59) compared to 11 nmol/min/mL (IQR 9 to 14) in patients without systemic envenoming; the difference between medians was 5 nmol/min/mL (95% confidence interval [CI] 4 to 12). The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of admission sPLA2 activity was the best predictor of systemic envenoming in all snakebites (AUC-ROC 0.72, 95% CI 0.66 to 0.79), whereas sNGAL and sClu concentrations were poor predictors. sPLA2 activity was a better predictor of systemic envenoming in Russell's viper bites (AUC-ROC 0.90, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.00) and in those presenting within 2 hours of a bite. A sPLA2 activity more than 23.5 nmol/min/mL had a sensitivity of 41% (95% CI 34% to 49%), and a specificity of 97% (95% CI 91% to 99.5%) in predicting systemic envenoming.

PCa diagnosis is mostly based on solid biopsy and prostate-specific antigen (PSA), which have the disadvantages of being invasive and insensitive, respectively. Recently, the detection of microRNAs (miRNAs) in expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) has been a promising approach for PCa diagnosis. The aim of this study is to quantify transcriptional levels of miRNA-32 in the urine of prostate cancer patients. In this study, we evaluated the expression of miRNA-32 in the urine of 27 PCa patients, 48 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and 20 healthy controls, using quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR). The expression levels were then compared with the clinicopathological characteristics of patients. The expression level of miRNA-32 in PCa patients was significantly higher than the control group (P < .01) and BPH cases (P < .01), and was associated with advanced tumor stage (P < .05). In addition, the expression of miRNA-32 had significant correlation with patients' age (r = 0.39, P = .043). Area under ROC curve (AUC) for the discrimination of PCa samples from control and BPH samples were 0.93 (P < .0001) and 0.78 (P < .0001), respectively. We also used logistic regression analysis to integrate the results of PSA, prostate volume and miRNA-32, and presented a predictive model for distinguishing PCa from BPH, highlighting the clinical utility of miRNA-32 in cancer diagnosis and risk assessment.

This was a retrospective study of infants with prenatally diagnosed isolated LCDH referred to a single tertiary center between 2008 and 2020. Fetuses with right or bilateral congenital diaphragmatic hernia, additional major structural anomaly or known genetic condition, as well as cases that underwent fetal intervention or declined postnatal intervention, were excluded. Ultrasound and MRI images were reviewed retrospectively. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed, incorporating prenatal and immediate neonatal factors to analyze the association with neonatal mortality prior to discharge, and a prediction calculator was generated. The performance of ultrasound and that of MRI for the prediction of neonatal mortality were compared. Of 253 pregnancies with fetal CDH, 104 met the inclusion criteria, of whom 77 (74%) neonates survived to discharge. Seventy-five fetuses underwent both prenatal ultrasound and MRI. On multivariable analysis, observed/expected (o/e) lung-to-head ratio and o/e total fetal lung volume were associated independently with neonatal death (adjusted odds ratio, 0.89 (95% CI, 0.83-0.95) and 0.90 (95% CI, 0.84-0.97), respectively), whereas liver position was not. There was no significant difference in predictive performance between using ultrasound and MRI together (area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC), 0.85 (95% CI, 0.76-0.93)) compared with using ultrasound alone (AUC, 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.90); P = 0.19). The addition of neonatal parameters (gestational age at birth and small-for-gestational age) did not improve model performance (AUC, 0.87 (95% CI, 0.80-0.95)) compared with the combined ultrasound and MRI model (P = 0.22). There was poor agreement between severity assessment on ultrasound and MRI (Cohen's κ, 0.19). Most discrepancies were seen among cases deemed to be non-severe on ultrasound and severe on MRI, and outcomes were more consistent with MRI-based prognostication. In fetuses with prenatally diagnosed isolated LCDH, mortality prediction using standardized ultrasound and MRI measurements performed reasonably well. In cases classified as non-severe on ultrasound, MRI is recommended, as it may provide more accurate prognostication and assist in the determination of candidacy for fetal intervention. © 2024 The Author(s).

Despite the high prevalence of PTE, current methods for predicting its occurrence remain limited. In this study, we aimed to identify imaging-based markers for the prediction of PTE using machine learning. Specifically, we examined three imaging features: Lesion volumes, resting-state fMRI-based measures of functional connectivity, and amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF). We employed three machine-learning methods, namely, kernel support vector machine (KSVM), random forest, and an artificial neural network (NN), to develop predictive models. Our results showed that the KSVM classifier, with all three feature types as input, achieved the best prediction accuracy of 0.78 AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve) using nested cross-validation. Furthermore, we performed voxel-wise and lobe-wise group difference analyses to investigate the specific brain regions and features that the model found to be most helpful in distinguishing PTE from non-PTE populations. Our statistical analysis uncovered significant differences in bilateral temporal lobes and cerebellum between PTE and non-PTE groups. Overall, our findings demonstrate the complementary prognostic value of MR-based markers in PTE prediction and provide new insights into the underlying structural and functional alterations associated with PTE.","2024","Human brain mapping"

Purpose To determine the prognostic value of CT-QFR in predicting the long-term outcomes of patients with suspected coronary artery disease (CAD) in comparison with invasive coronary angiography (ICA)/SPECT and to determine the influence of prior percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) on the prognostic value of CT-QFR. Materials and Methods In this secondary analysis of the prospective international CORE320 study, 379 participants who underwent coronary CTA and SPECT within 60 days before ICA between November 2009 and July 2011 were included for follow-up. The coronary CTA images were analyzed to determine CT-QFR. The primary outcome was major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) in the 5-year follow-up. Kaplan-Meier curves, multivariable Cox regression models adjusted for clinical variables, and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUCs) were used to assess and compare the predictive ability of CT-QFR and ICA/SPECT. Results CT-QFR computation and 5-year follow-up data were available for 310 participants (median age, 62 years), of whom 205 (66%) were male. CT-QFR (hazard ratio, 1.9 [95% CI: 1.0, 3.5]; P = .04) and prior myocardial infarction (hazard ratio, 2.5 [95% CI: 1.5, 4.0]; P < .001) were independent predictors of MACE occurrence in the 5-year follow-up. MACE-free survival rates were similar in participants with normal CT-QFR and ICA/SPECT (82% vs 80%; P = .45) and in participants with abnormal CT-QFR and ICA/SPECT findings (60% vs 57%; P = .40). In participants with prior PCI, CT-QFR had a lower AUC in predicting MACEs than in participants without prior PCI (0.44 vs 0.70; P < .001). Conclusion CT-QFR was an independent predictor of MACEs in the 5-year follow-up in participants with suspected CAD and showed similar 5-year prognostic value to ICA/SPECT; however, prior PCI affected CT-QFR ability to predict MACEs.

This study evaluated the diagnostic value of serum TARC combined with immunoglobulin E (IgE) levels as biomarkers in forensic settings. The subjects were 100 autopsy cases, categorized into fatal asthma (n = 25), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) (n = 37), and traumatic deaths (n = 38). TARC levels were significantly elevated in asthma (525.68 ± 801.87 pg/mL) compared with AMI (180.35 ± 109.37 pg/mL) and trauma (173.26 ± 105.01 pg/mL) cases. Similarly, serum IgE levels were higher in asthma (3363.72 ± 7023.46 KU/L) than in AMI (130.92 ± 260.79 KU/L) and trauma (134.53 ± 195.41 KU/L) cases. ROC curve analysis showed that serum TARC had a sensitivity of 68.0 % and specificity of 73.6 % (AUC 0.763, cut-off value of 225 pg/mL). In comparison, serum IgE had a sensitivity of 80 % and specificity of 86.1 % (AUC 0.881, cut-off value of 307 KU/L). The combined use of TARC and IgE increased the diagnostic specificity to 95.8 %. Serum TARC and IgE are valuable biomarkers for diagnosing fatal asthma in forensic settings. While serum TARC levels correlate with Th2-mediated inflammation, the combined measurement of TARC and IgE enhances the diagnostic accuracy, providing significant specificity for confirming asthma diagnosis.","2024","Forensic science international"

We compared the potential diagnostic value of Apo10 and TKTL1 with commonly used tumor markers in differentiating breast cancer patients. Physical examination and blood sample data from breast cancer patients who did not receive surgery or chemotherapy (retrospective; breast cancer group) and those with benign breast nodules and completely healthy subjects (prospective; control group) were collected from October 2020 to July 2022 at Sun Yat-sen University. Descriptive statistics and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated. The area under the ROC curve (AUROC) was calculated to compare the diagnostic efficiency of Apo10 and TKTL1 with conventional biomarkers (carcinoembryonic antigen [CEA], cancer antigens [CA-125, CA-199, CA-153]) in differentiating breast cancer from healthy breasts and benign breast nodules. From October 2020 to July 2022, 153 breast cancer patients (primarily early-stage disease: n = 113 (73.9%) stage I/II) and 153 control participants (benign breast nodules, n = 56; healthy, n = 97) were included in this study. The breast cancer subtypes were mainly invasive ductal carcinoma (92.8%), with a few cases of DCIS (5.9%), infiltrating lobular carcinoma (0.7%), and mucinous carcinoma (0.7%). Notably, Apo10, TKTL1, and Apo10 + TKTL1 (APT) levels were significantly greater in the cancer group than in the control group (P < 0.001), demonstrating high diagnostic value (AUC = 0.901, 0.871, 0.938) that surpassed CA-125, CA-199, CA-153, and CEA. In a subgroup analysis excluding stage III patients, APT-based breast cancer screening was minimally affected, with the AUROC (0.933-0.938) varying by ≤ 1%. Compared with conventional biomarkers, Apo10, TKTL1, and APT showed superior early-stage breast cancer screening efficacy, potentially emerging as a promising marker for discriminating breast cancer from healthy breasts and nontumoral lesions.","2024","Breast cancer research and treatment"

This retrospective study involved 286 cancer patients confirmed by histopathology from center 1 (Training set) and 66 patients from center 2 (External test set). Radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted imaging (T2WI) and diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) sequences, whereas DL features were obtained using four models: MobileNet-V3-large, Inception-V3, ResNet50, and VGG16. These DL radiomics (DLR) features were then combined to construct a machine learning model. The Shapley additive interpretation (SHAP) tool was utilized to investigate the interpretability of the model. We evaluated and compared the diagnostic performance of senior and junior radiologists, with and without the aid of the optimal DLR model. Kaplan-Meier survival curve was used to analyze the prognosis of patients. The DLR model outperforms individual DL models and the radiomics model. The MobileNet-V3-large combination radiomics signature demonstrated the best performance, achieving an AUC of 0.878 on the Training set and 0.752 on the External test set. Compared to the traditional radiomics model, the AUC for the Training set increased by 0.094 and by 0.051 for the External test set. This model facilitated improved diagnostic performance among both junior and senior radiologists. Specifically, the AUC values for junior and senior radiologists increased by 0.162 and 0.232, respectively, on the Training set; and by 0.096 and 0.113, respectively, on the External test set. The DLR model demonstrated strong performance in risk stratification for disease-free survival.

Methylation EPIC 850K beadchip and RNA-sequencing were used to analyse 29 tissue samples from patients with early-stage breast cancer (BC) and benign breast tumours for differently methylated and expressed genes. The altered methylation of IL21R was semi-quantitatively validated in an independent study with 566 tissue samples (279 BC vs. 287 benign breast tumours) using mass spectrometry. Binary logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the association between IL21R methylation and BC. BC-associated IL21R hypomethylation and overexpression were identified in the discovery round. In the validation round, BC patients presented significant IL21R hypomethylation compared to women with benign breast tumours (ORs ≥1.29 per-10% methylation, p-values ≤ 5.69E-14), and this hypomethylation was even enhanced in BC patients with ER-negative and PR-negative tumours as well as with triple-negative tumours.

Current diagnostic approaches, specifically traditional cross-sectional imaging techniques, face certain limitations. But radiomics has been shown to have high diagnostic accuracy across a range of diseases. Objective to conduct a comprehensive review of the literature on the use of radiomics to differentiate Mucinous Cystic Neoplasm (MCN) from Serous Cystic Neoplasm (SCN). This study was comprehensively searched in Pubmed, Scopus and Web of Science databases for meta-analysis of studies that used radiomics to distinguish MCN from SCN. Risk of bias was assessed using the diagnostic accuracy study quality assessment method and combined with sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio, and summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC)curve analysis. A total of 884 patients from 8 studies were included in this analysis, including 365 MCN and 519 SCN. The Meta-analysis found that radiomics identified MCN and SCN with high sensitivity and specificity, with combined sensitivity and specificity of 0.84(0.82-0.87) and 0.82(0.79-0.84). The positive likelihood ratio (PLR) and the negative likelihood ratio (NLR) are 5.61(3.72, 8.47) and 0.14(0.09-0.26). In addition, the area under the SROC curve (AUC) was drawn at 0.93.

We aimed to evaluate whether artificial intelligence-based morphological features of primary and secondary PV branches on computed tomography images are associated with AF recurrence post-ablation. Two artificial intelligence models were trained for the segmentation of computed tomography images, enabling the isolation of PV branches. Patients from Cleveland Clinic (N=135) and Vanderbilt University (N=594) were combined and divided into 2 sets for training and cross-validation (D1, n=218) and internal testing (D2, n=511). An independent validation set (D3, N=80) was obtained from University Hospitals of Cleveland. We extracted 48 fractal-based and 12 shape-based radiomic features from primary and secondary PV branches of patients with AF recurrence (AF+) and without recurrence after catheter ablation of AF (AF-). To predict AFrecurrence, 3 Gradient Boosting classification models based on significant features from primary (Mp), secondary (Ms), and combined (Mc) PV branches were built. Features relating to primary PVs were found to be associated with AF recurrence. The Mp classifier achieved area under the curve values of 0.73, 0.71, and 0.70 across the 3 datasets. AF+ cases exhibited greater surface complexity in their primary PV area, as evidenced by higher fractal dimension values compared with AF- cases. The Ms classifier results revealed a weaker association with AF+, suggesting higher relevance to AF recurrence post-ablation from primary PV branch morphology. This largest multi-institutional study to date revealed associations between artificial intelligence-extracted morphological features of the primary PV branches with AF recurrence in 809 patients from 3 sites.

Class imbalance adversely impacts predictive performance, especially for low-incidence complications. To evaluate risk-prediction model performance when trained on risk-specific cohorts. This cross-sectional study performed from February 2024 to July 2024 deployed a deep learning model, which generated risk scores for common postoperative complications. A total of 109 445 inpatient operations performed at 2 University of Florida Health hospitals from June 1, 2014, to May 5, 2021 were examined. The model was trained de novo on separate cohorts for high-risk, medium-risk, and low-risk Common Procedure Terminology codes defined empirically by incidence of 5 postoperative complications: (1) in-hospital mortality; (2) prolonged intensive care unit (ICU) stay (≥48 hours); (3) prolonged mechanical ventilation (≥48 hours); (4) sepsis; and (5) acute kidney injury (AKI). Low-risk and high-risk cutoffs for complications were defined by the lower-third and upper-third prevalence in the dataset, except for mortality, cutoffs for which were set at 1% or less and greater than 3%, respectively. Model performance metrics were assessed for each risk-specific cohort alongside the baseline model. Metrics included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), F1 scores, and accuracy for each model. A total of 109 445 inpatient operations were examined among patients treated at 2 University of Florida Health hospitals in Gainesville (77 921 procedures [71.2%]) and Jacksonville (31 524 procedures [28.8%]). Median (IQR) patient age was 58 (43-68) years, and median (IQR) Charlson Comorbidity Index score was 2 (0-4). Among 109 445 operations, 55 646 patients were male (50.8%), and 66 495 patients (60.8%) underwent a nonemergent, inpatient operation. Training on the high-risk cohort had variable impact on AUROC, but significantly improved AUPRC (as assessed by nonoverlapping 95% confidence intervals) for predicting mortality (0.53; 95% CI, 0.43-0.64), AKI (0.61; 95% CI, 0.58-0.65), and prolonged ICU stay (0.91; 95% CI, 0.89-0.92). It also significantly improved F1 score for mortality (0.42; 95% CI, 0.36-0.49), prolonged mechanical ventilation (0.55; 95% CI, 0.52-0.58), sepsis (0.46; 95% CI, 0.43-0.49), and AKI (0.57; 95% CI, 0.54-0.59).

For that, we develop predictive models that rely on Electronic Health Records (EHR) and predict whether a person will go through a sleep apnea test after the age of 50. A major challenge is the variability in EHR records in various insured members over the years, which this study investigates as well in the context of controls matching, and prediction. Since there are many temporal variables, the RankLi method was introduced for temporal variable selection. This approach employs the t-test to calculate a divergence score for each temporal variable between the target classes. We also investigate here the need to consider the number of EHR records, as part of control matching, and whether modeling separately for subgroups according to the number of EHR records is more effective. For each prediction task, we trained 4 different classifiers including 1-CNN, LSTM, Random Forest, and Logistic Regression, on data until the age of 40 or 50, and on several numbers of temporal variables. Using the number of EHR records for control matching was found crucial, and using learning models for subsets of the population according to the number of EHR records they have was found more effective. The deep learning models, particularly the 1-CNN, achieved the highest balanced accuracy and AUC scores in both male and female groups.

We have developed a universal data wrangling pipeline to process and merge heterogeneous data sources of the All of Us dataset, address missingness and variance in data, and align disparate data modalities into a coherent framework for analysis. Utilizing a composite feature set including EHR, lifestyle, and social determinants of health (SDoH) data, we then employed Adaptive Lasso and Random Forest regression models to predict 6 CVD outcomes. The models were evaluated using the c-index and time-dependent Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve over a 10-year period. The Adaptive Lasso model showed consistent performance across most CVD outcomes, while the Random Forest model excelled particularly in predicting outcomes like transient ischemic attack when incorporating the full multi-model feature set. Feature importance analysis revealed age and previous coronary events as dominant predictors across CVD outcomes, with SDoH clustering labels highlighting the nuanced impact of social factors. The development of both Cox-based predictive model and Random Forest Regression model represents the extensive application of the All of Us, in integrating EHR and patient surveys to enhance precision medicine. And the inclusion of SDoH clustering labels revealed the significant impact of sociobehavioral factors on patient outcomes, emphasizing the importance of comprehensive health determinants in predictive models.

Plasma was collected from patients pre-procedurally (PDAC, n = 82; CP, n = 25) and from HC (n = 39), and studied by ELISA. Clinical and routine laboratory data were collected, and pancreas was defined as soft or non-soft based on intraoperative or imaging findings. Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman correlation coefficients, ROC analysis were used for statistical analysis. Plasma MLKL was lower in patients with CP than in other groups (p < 0.001) and PDAC patients treated with upfront surgery (PDACUS, n = 65) had lower MLKL than HC (p = 0.035). MLKL differentiated CP from PDACUS (AUC 0.83, p < 0.001). sST2 levels were significantly lower in HC than in other groups (p < 0.001) and in PDAC patients with a soft pancreas compared with non-soft (p < 0.005). In Lewis antigen positive PDACUS (n = 59), sST2 had positive correlations with CA19-9 measured concurrently and after 1 month, and with CEA measured after 1 or 6 months. Circulating levels of MLKL are lower in patients with CP than PDAC. Elevated sST2 levels are associated with pancreatic diseases. Further studies are required to show whether MLKL and sST2 could be useful biomarkers in evaluating pancreatic diseases.","2024","Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

We aimed to develop a method to detect differentially expressed miRNAs from lung cancer whole blood samples that are not influenced by variations in leukocyte proportions. The Ref-miREO method identifies differential miRNAs unaffected by changes in leukocyte populations by comparing the within-sample relative expression orderings (REOs) of miRNAs from healthy leukocyte subtypes and those from lung cancer blood samples. Over 77% of the differential miRNAs observed between lung cancer and healthy blood samples overlapped with those between myeloid-derived and lymphoid-derived leukocytes, suggesting the potential impact of changes in leukocyte populations on miRNA profile. Ref-miREO identified 16 differential miRNAs that target 19 lung adenocarcinoma-related genes previously linked to leukocytes. These miRNAs showed enrichment in cancer-related pathways and demonstrated high potential as diagnostic biomarkers, with the LASSO regression models effectively distinguishing between healthy and lung cancer blood or serum samples (all AUC > 0.85). Additionally, 12 of these miRNAs exhibited significant prognostic correlations. The Ref-miREO method offers valuable candidates for circulating biomarker detection in cancer that are not affected by changes in leukocyte populations.","2024","Epigenetics"

We compared lesion conspicuity in contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) and contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) in patients with suspicious breast lesions. IRB-approved retrospective study; three blinded readers rated 462 indeterminate or suspicious breast lesions in 388 patients (54.2 ± 11 years; range 30-90) who underwent CEM and CE-MRI from 2018 to 2022. Each lesion's conspicuity was scored from 1 to 5, with 5 indicating excellent conspicuity. Visual grading characteristics (VGC) analysis and area under the curve (AUC) were used for comparison, with sub-analyses for benign and malignant lesions. VGC analysis showed a significant AUC of 0.670 to 0.723 (p < 0.001) favouring CE-MRI. No lesion enhancement (score 1) was observed in 16.2% of CE-MRI and 44.7% of CEM. Excellent conspicuity was seen in 29.6% of CE-MRI and 11.9% of CEM. Sub-analysis showed higher conspicuity on CE-MRI for both malignant (AUC 0.665 to 0.732, p < 0.001) and benign lesions (AUC 0.734 to 0.798, p < 0.001). CE-MRI showed higher lesion conspicuity compared to CEM both for non-mass lesions (0.656) and for mass lesions 0.605. CE-MRI shows significantly higher conspicuity for benign and malignant breast lesions compared to CEM, especially for benign lesions. The low conspicuity of benign lesions on CEM may help reduce false positives in clinical practice. Question Lesion conspicuity is a new descriptor for lesion enhancement according to the new CEM lexicon. Data correlating lesion conspicuity with malignancy likelihood are limited. Findings Lesion conspicuity is higher for contrast-enhanced-MRI than for contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) for all lesions but significantly better for benign lesions. Clinical relevance The low conspicuity of benign lesions on CEM may reduce false-positive results, making it a valuable tool in breast cancer screening.","2024","European radiology"

Furthermore, this study seeks to develop a statistically-based diagnostic model leveraging demographic and health indicators to provide personalized risk assessments for OP. A retrospective analysis was conducted on the demographic data, health profiles, and bone density measurements of 2224 female patients. Key variables associated with OP were identified using chi-square tests. Feature selection was refined through Lasso regression and recursive feature elimination (RFE), which guided the development of a logistic regression-based dynamic nomogram. This model was subsequently implemented on the Shiny platform for personalized online OP risk assessments. Among 2224 female patients, 801 (36.0 %) were diagnosed with OP. Women aged 70 and older exhibited a significantly higher prevalence of OP compared to younger age groups (OR = 5.83, 95 % CI: 1.74-19.61, P = 0.004), and this remained significant in the multivariable analysis (OR = 5.18, 95 % CI: 1.19-22.52, P = 0.028). Later age at menarche was associated with increased OP risk (OR = 1.31, 95 % CI: 1.09-1.57, P = 0.004), persisting in multivariable analysis (OR = 1.25, 95 % CI: 1.03-1.52, P = 0.023). In rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, higher education reduced OP risk, with secondary education (OR = 0.09, P = 0.024) and college education (OR = 0.04, P = 0.009) showing protective effects. Diabetic patients who were unmarried or had non-traditional marital statuses showed increased OP risk (univariate OR = 2.73, P = 0.006; multivariate OR = 2.34, P = 0.029). Among nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) patients, age at menopause was significantly linked to OP risk (univariate OR = 1.04, P = 0.012). The prediction model showed strong performance (AUC = 0.720), and the dynamic nomogram on the Shiny platform provided effective personalized OP risk assessments. Age and age at menarche are significant risk factors for OP, with later menarche increasing the risk. In RA patients, higher education levels were associated with a lower risk of OP. In contrast, unmarried or non-traditional marital statuses increased OP risk among diabetic patients. Additionally, age at menopause was found to be a significant factor for OP risk in NAFLD patients. The prediction model developed in this study, with an AUC of 0.720, provides a reliable method for personalized OP risk assessment through a dynamic nomogram. These findings highlight the crucial role of demographic factors in predicting OP risk and underscore the importance of personalized treatment strategies for effective OP prevention and management.","2024","Experimental gerontology"

In this study, we aimed to apply baseline MR radiomic features to predict NAC response to help select NAC-guided de-intensification candidates, and to explore biological underpinnings of response-oriented radiomics. Pre-treatment MR images and clinical data of 131 patients with HPV-positive OPSCC were retrieved from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. Patients were divided into training cohort (n = 47), validation cohort 1 (n = 49) from NAC response-adapted de-intensification trial (IChoice-01, NCT04012502) and real-world validation cohort 2 (n = 35). NAC prediction model using linear support vector machine (SVM) was built and validated. Subsequent nomograms combined radiomics and clinical characteristics were established to predict survival outcomes. RNA-seq and proteomic data were compared to interpret the molecular features underlying radiomic signatures with differential NAC response. For NAC response prediction, the fusion model with both oropharyngeal and nodal signatures achieved encouraging performance to predict good responders in the training cohort (AUC 0·89, 95% CI, 0·79-0·95) and validation cohort 1 (AUC 0·71, 95% CI, 0·59-0·83). For prognosis prediction, radiomics-based nomograms exhibited satisfactory discriminative ability between low-risk and high-risk patients (PFS, C-index 0·85, 0·76 and 0·83; OS, C-index 0·79, 0·76 and 0·87, respectively) in three cohorts. Expression analysis unveiled NAC poor responders had predominantly enhanced keratinization while good responders were featured by upregulated immune response and oxidative stress. The MR-based radiomic models and prognostic models efficiently discriminate among patients with different NAC response and survival risk, which help candidate selection in HPV-positive OPSCC with regard to personalized treatment de-intensification.","2024","Oral oncology"

We evaluated the role of the early life gut microbiome in infantile colic and later development of atopic and gastrointestinal disorders. Copenhagen Prospective Studies on Asthma in Childhood2010 cohort was followed with 6 years of extensive clinical phenotyping. The 1-month gut microbiome was analyzed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Infantile colic was evaluated at age 3 months by interviews. Clinical endpoints included constipation to age 3 years and prospectively diagnosed asthma and atopic dermatitis in the first 6 years of life, and allergic sensitization from skin prick tests, specific Immunoglobulin E, and component analyses. Of 695 children, 55 children (7.9%) had infantile colic. Several factors were associated with colic including race, breastfeeding, and pets. The 1-month gut microbiome composition and taxa abundances were not associated with colic, however a sparse Partial Least Squares model including combined abundances of nine species was moderately predictive of colic: median, cross-validated AUC = 0.627, p = .003. Children with infantile colic had an increased risk of developing constipation (aOR, 2.88 [1.51-5.35], p = .001) later in life, but also asthma (aHR, 1.69 [1.02-2.79], p = .040), atopic dermatitis (aHR, 1.84 [1.20-2.81], p = .005) and had a higher number of positive allergic components (adjusted difference, 116% [14%-280%], p = .012) in the first 6 years. These associations were not mediated by gut microbiome differences. We link infantile colic with risk of developing constipation and atopic disorders in the first 6 years of life, which was not mediated through an altered gut microbiome at age 1-month. These results suggest infantile colic to involve gastrointestinal and/or atopic mechanisms.","2024","Allergy"

In this systematic review, we evaluated the predictive accuracy of a broad spectrum of biomarkers for psychotic relapse. We also underline methodological concerns, focusing on the value of prospective studies for relapse onset estimation. Following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis) guidelines, a list of search strings related to biomarkers and relapse was assimilated and run against the PubMed and Scopus databases, yielding a total of 808 unique records. After exclusion of studies related to the distinction of patients from controls or treatment effects, the 42 remaining studies were divided into 5 groups, based on the type of biomarker used as a predictor: the genetic biomarker subgroup (n = 4, or 9%), the blood-based biomarker subgroup (n = 15, or 36%), the neuroimaging biomarker subgroup (n = 10, or 24%), the cognitive-behavioral biomarker subgroup (n = 5, or 12%) and the wearables biomarker subgroup (n = 8, or 19%). In the first 4 groups, several factors were found to correlate with the state of relapse, such as the genetic risk profile, Interleukin-6, Vitamin D or panels consisting of multiple markers (blood-based), ventricular volume, grey matter volume in the right hippocampus, various functional connectivity metrics (neuroimaging), working memory and executive function (cognition). In the wearables group, machine learning models were trained based on features such as heart rate, acceleration, and geolocation, which were measured continuously. While the achieved predictive accuracy differed compared to chance, its power was moderate (max reported AUC = 0.77). The first 4 groups revealed risk factors, but cross-sectional designs or sparse sampling in prospective studies did not allow for relapse onset estimations. Studies involving wearables provide more concrete predictions of relapse but utilized markers such as geolocation do not advance pathophysiological understanding. A combination of the two approaches is warranted to fully understand and predict relapse.","2024","Frontiers in psychiatry"

To address this, a Machine Learning (ML) algorithm based on the Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) was developed for identifying motor actions using surface Electromyography (sEMG) during continuous reach-to-grasp movements, involving multiple Degrees of Freedom (DoFs). This study explores feature extraction methods based on time domain and autoregressive models to evaluate ELM performance under different conditions. The experimental setup encompassed variations in neuron size, time windows, validation with each muscle, increase in the number of features, comparison with five conventional ML-based classifiers, inter-subjects variability, and temporal dynamic response. To evaluate the efficacy of the proposed ELM-based method, an openly available sEMG dataset containing data from 12 participants was used. Results highlight the method's performance, achieving Accuracy above 85%, F-score above 90%, Recall above 85%, Area Under the Curve of approximately 84% and compilation times (computational cost) of less than 1 ms. These metrics significantly outperform standard methods (p < 0.05). Additionally, specific trends were found in increasing and decreasing performance in identifying specific tasks, as well as variations in the continuous transitions in the temporal dynamics response. Thus, the ELM-based method effectively identifies continuous reach-to-grasp motions through myoelectric data. These findings hold promise for practical applications. The method's success prompts future research into implementing it for more reliable and effective Human-Machine Interface (HMI) control. This can revolutionize real-time upper limb rehabilitation, enabling natural and complex Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) like object manipulation.

A retrospective and longitudinal case-control study was conducted at Beijing Chao-yang Hospital. It included 75 patients who were clinically diagnosed with PsA in the case group and 345 who solely suffered from PsO without PsA in the control group. A variety of baseline covariates were gathered from every patient with PsO. Univariate and multivariate analyses and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify underlying risk factors and determine whether it was necessary to examine the imaging of PsO patients. In multivariate logistic regression analysis, age ≥40 (odds ratio (OR): 1.04, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02-1.06, P < 0.01), nail involvement (OR: 1.17, 95% CI: 1.09-1.32, P < 0.01), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) (OR: 1.03, 95% CI: 1.01-1.06, P < 0.05) and elevated high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) (OR: 1.31, 95% CI: 1.13-1.53, P < 0.01) were perceived to be risk factors for the transformation from PsO into clinical PsA. By combining magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-detected enthesitis with tenosynovitis, combined predictors demonstrated better diagnostic efficacy, with an improvement in specificity (94.3% vs. 69%) and similarities in sensitivity (89% vs. 84.6%).

This study aimed to identify alternative parameters for predicting AIT responders based on clinical data collected in daily practice. We conducted a retrospective analysis of patients with house-dust-mite-driven asthma and/or rhinitis who completed 3 years of subcutaneous AIT (3y-AIT). We assessed the efficacy of AIT using the estimated daily symptom and medication score (edSMS) during different treatment periods, including up-dosing, maintenance I, II, and III phases. These scores were derived from detailed records of symptoms and medication use for AIT injections. A responder was defined as an individual with a reduction in edSMS of at least 30% from up-dosing to maintenance III phase (ΔedSMSU-M3). A cohort of 133 patients was analyzed, revealing a significant overall improvement in the disease condition after 3y-AIT. Responders demonstrated lower rates of polysensitization, daily tobacco smoke exposure, and milder pretreatment disease severity compared to non-responders (p = 0.003, p = 0.001, and p = 0.019, respectively). We observed 8 clinical response patterns among included subjects, but only a small group of patients (16/133, 12.03%) demonstrated consistent improvement throughout the 3y-AIT. Serum total immunoglobulin E (tIgE), specific immunoglobulin E (sIgE), sIgE/tIgE ratios, and edSMS during the up-dosing phase failed to differentiate the clinical response patterns or correlate with 3y-AIT efficacy. Notably, the reduction in edSMS from up-dosing phase to maintenance I phase (ΔedSMSU-M1) significantly associated with the 3y-AIT outcome (r = 0.443, p < 0.001). Receiver-operating characteristic curves indicated that ΔedSMSU-M1, with a cut-off of 18.40%, effectively predicted responders (AUC: 0.75, sensitivity: 76.20%, specificity: 76.70%). The individualized clinical responses to AIT may pose challenges in identifying predictors for treatment efficacy. Nonetheless, despite this complexity, our study highlights that the effectiveness observed in the early maintenance phase serves as a suitable predictor of 3y-AIT outcomes.","2024","The World Allergy Organization journal"

Stress hyperglycemia has been confirmed to have a significant prognostic role in a range of diseases. However, studies on the association between stress hyperglycemia and the outcome of ICH have not currently been reported. Critically ill patients diagnosed with ICH in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (MIMIC-IV) database were included in our study. Logistic regression and Cox regression were used to analyze the correlation between stress hyperglycemia and the outcome of ICH. The predictive ability of different glucose metrics was demonstrated by the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve and was further compared by the integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index. A total of 880 ICH patients in the MIMIC-IV database were included in this study. In logistic regression and Cox regression, blood glucose level (BGL), glycemic gap (GG), and stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) were independent predictors of unfavorable outcomes in ICH after adjustment for other confounders. The IDI results indicated that the 5-day maximum stress hyperglycemia ratio had better predictive performance than glycemic gap and blood glucose level in-hospital mortality and 1-year mortality, and the predictive performance of the 5-day maximum stress hyperglycemia ratio was better than that of stress hyperglycemia ratio measured at admission. In the age-stratified subgroup analysis, the 5-day maximum stress hyperglycemia ratio was more sensitive in predicting long-term outcomes in the young subgroup than in the elderly subgroup. The 5-day maximum stress hyperglycemia ratio is strongly correlated with an elevated risk of mortality in ICH patients and displays a better predictive ability than glycemic gap and blood glucose level in the short/long-term prognosis of ICH.","2024","Neurosurgical review"

Currently, one of the main treatment options for lung cancer is radiotherapy, but this treatment is associated with complications, such as an increased risk of cardiac-related morbidity and mortality. However, currently available methods for predicting radiation-induced heart disease (RIHD) remain suboptimal. Methods: In this pilot study, using the RT-qPCR method, we analyzed the expression levels of six miRNAs (miRNA-1-3p, miRNA-21-5p, miRNA-24-3p, miRNA-29a-3p, miRNA-34a-5p, and miRNA-222-3p). Results: Fourteen pairs of locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer patients' plasma samples, taken before and after radiotherapy, were examined. It was observed that miRNA-1-3p, miRNA-21-5p, miRNA-24-3p, miRNA-29a-3p, and miRNA-222-3p were downregulated, while miRNA-34a-5p was upregulated in lung cancer patients' plasma after treatment. Additionally, after definitive radiotherapy, patients with an increased NT-proBNP value displayed a statistically significant difference in miRNA-222-3p levels compared to the normal range of this indicator. The panel of the combined four miRNAs for assessing the risk of cardiac comorbidities demonstrated an AUC of 0.79, sensitivity of 71.43%, and specificity of 100%, with further improved values upon integration with clinical biomarker NT-proBNP. Conclusions: This pilot study shows that the identification of changes in miRNA expression levels in lung cancer patients' plasma before and after radiotherapy could be used for the early diagnosis of RIHD.","2024","Life (Basel, Switzerland)"

All patients were randomly divided into training and validation groups in a 7:3 ratio. Regions of interest (ROI), specifically the paravertebral muscles at the L3/4 intervertebral disc level, were delineated on axial T2-weighted images (T2WI). The Gaussian mixture model (GMM), K-means clustering, and Otsu's thresholding algorithms were employed to automatically segment muscle and adipose tissues at both the cohort and case levels. Subsequently, the mean signal intensity, volumes, and percentages of these tissues were calculated and compared. Logistic regression analyses were conducted to construct models and identify independent predictors of sarcopenia. An combined model was developed by combining the optimal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) model and clinical predictors. The performance of the constructed model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Age, BMI, and serum albumin were identified as independent clinical predictors of sarcopenia. The cohort-level GMM demonstrated the best predictive performance both in the training group (AUC=0.840) and validation group (AUC=0.800), while the predictive performance of the other models was lower than that of the clinical model both in the training and validation groups. After combining the cohort-level GMM with the independent clinical predictors, the AUC of the training and validation groups increased to 0.871 and 0.867, respectively. The cohort-level GMM shows potential in predicting sarcopenia, and the incorporation of independent clinical predictors further increased the performance.","2024","European journal of radiology"

It should be investigated whether ADHD questionnaires are accurate in screening symptoms in young adults with autism. The current study examined this. Participants were autistic young adults (N = 119) who took part in the Special Needs and Autism Project (SNAP), a population-based cohort. ADHD research diagnoses were obtained through the parent-informed Young Adult Psychiatric Assessment. Parents and young adults (self-report sample N = 71) completed ADHD questionnaires (Aberrant Behavior Checklist hyperactivity/non-compliance subscale, Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scales ADHD Index, and Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire ADHD subscale). Receiver operating characteristic analyses were conducted to explore if the questionnaires discriminated ADHD cases from non-cases. To assess whether results varied by intellectual functioning, subgroup analyses were completed for those with an IQ ≥ 70 vs. <70. Weighted ADHD rates were high. Overall although the measures were performing at or close to adequate levels (area under the curve was 0.66 to 0.79 for parent-report and 0.70 to 0.65 for self-report), no single measure met adequate thresholds for sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. Tool performance was not different for those with an IQ ≥ 70 vs. <70.

Seventy-eight CRSwNP patients with OD who underwent ESS were enrolled. Preoperative and 6-month-postoperative olfactory function were assessed using Sniffin' Sticks. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed to set the cutoff points. Risk factors were determined by logistic models. A power analysis was conducted to evaluate the sample size. Overall, 66.7% of CRSwNP patients had unrecovered olfaction after surgery. Patients with unrecovered olfaction displayed higher preoperative threshold-discrimination-identification (TDI) score, lower Questionnaire for Olfactory Disorders-Negative Statements (QOD-NS) score, lower total olfactory cleft score (TOCS), and fewer tissue eosinophils than those of the improved/recovered group. QOD-NS ≤ 5.0, preoperative TOCS ≤ 4.5 and tissue eosinophil count ≤ 8.3 were independent risk factors for unrecovered olfaction. Based on these variables, a predictive model was developed. The area under the ROC curve for the model was 0.845, and the optimal cutoff value was 2.0 points, with a sensitivity of 82.7% and specificity of 80.8%. Low levels of QOD-NS score (preoperative), TOCS (preoperative) and tissue eosinophil count are independent risk factors for short-term unrecovered olfaction in CRS patients with OD postoperatively. The predictive model developed here is practical and convenient for the early identification of poor prognosis of OD, enabling early additional intervention.","2024","Rhinology"

Furthermore, corresponding to the Youden index or pre-specified levels, sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values were determined. In total, 361 participants were included. All questionnaires showed high AUC values to identify high-risk patients, defined on the basis of CPET-VO2peak thresholds. FitMáx and VSAQ demonstrated superior results compared to the other questionnaires. Based on the Youden index, the optimal questionnaire-VO2peak cut-off values were 20.6, 21.3, and 26.1 ml·kg-1·min-1 for the FitMáx and 16.3, 18.2, and 20.4 ml·kg-1·min-1 for the VSAQ corresponding to the VO2peak thresholds 16.0, 18.2 and 24.5 ml·kg-1·min-1 respectively.

This was a non-interventional, multicenter, observational, prospective study carried out in 62 Oncology and Hematology services in Spain and Portugal between January 2018 and December 2019. The main objective of the CARTAGO study was to develop a predictive model within a competitive risk framework to assess the risk of VTE in patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy, biological, or hormonal treatment. A total of 1596 patients were analyzed. VTE events occurred in 124 (8%) during the 6-month follow-up period (42% of deep vein thrombosis [DVT], 48% of pulmonary embolism [PE], and 10% of both DVT and PE). Four variables were selected for the multivariate predictive model to determine the risk of VTE (tumor type, D-dimer, compression of a vessel by the tumor, and leukocyte count). The 4 variables were associated with an increased risk of VTE (C-statistic, 0.646 [95%CI, 0.620-0.673]). The most significant variables in the internal validation with bootstrapping were the ""very high risk"" tumors (hazard ratio [HR] 2.032; 95%CI, 1.287-3.211). The CARTAGO model predicts the VTE risk in patients with cancer receiving anticancer therapy in an outpatient setting. This model can easily aid in identifying ambulatory patients who would probably benefit from primary thromboprophylaxis.","2024","The oncologist"

Long and intact cardiac troponin T (cTnT) forms are typical for MI. This study sought to assess whether the fragmentation composition of cTnT release in TTS differs from MI. The concentration of long molecular forms of cTnT (long cTnT) was measured with a novel upconversion luminescence immunoassay and total cTnT with a commercial high-sensitivity cTnT assay in 24 TTS patients and in 84 Type 1 MI patients. The ratio of long to total cTnT (troponin ratio) was determined as a measure of cTnT fragmentation. Troponin ratio was lower in TTS patients [0.13 (0.10-0.20) vs. 0.62 (0.29-0.96), P < 0.001]. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analyses, troponin ratio showed a better predictive power than total cTnT in discriminating TTS and MI patients {area under the curve [AUC] 0.869 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.789-0.948] vs. 0.766 [95% CI 0.677-0.855], P = 0.047}. When restricting the analysis to patients with total cTnT below 1200 ng/L (maximal value in TTS patients), the respective AUC values for total cTnT and troponin ratio were 0.599 (95% CI 0.465-0.732) and 0.816 (95% CI 0.712-0.921) (P = 0.003). At a cut-off point of 0.12, troponin ratio correctly identified 95% of MI patients and 50% of TTS patients. In contrast to Type 1 MI, only a small fraction of circulating cTnT in TTS exists in intact or long molecular forms. This clear difference in troponin composition could be of diagnostic value when evaluating patients with cTnT elevations and suspicion of TTS.

Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), an autoimmune disorder, influences the progression of several other conditions; however, the link between T1DM and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) remains unclear. This study investigated the underlying immune response mechanisms that contribute to the development and progression of T1DM and MCI. Microarray datasets for MCI (GSE63060) and T1DM (GSE30208) were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified using the limma package. To explore the functional implications of these DEGs, Gene Ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analyses were conducted using ClusterProfiler. Protein-protein interaction networks for the DEGs were constructed using the STRING database and visualized using Cytoscape. The Molecular Complex Detection algorithm was used to analyze DEGs. Immune cell infiltration in patients with T1DM and MCI was analyzed using the xCell method. Gene set enrichment analysis was used to gain in-depth insights into the functional characteristics of T1DM and MCI. Immune-related genes were obtained from the GeneCards and ImmPort databases. Machine learning algorithms were used to identify potential hub genes associated with immunity for T1DM and MCI diagnosis, and the diagnostic value was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve. The identified genes were validated using quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In the T1DM and MCI datasets, 610 DEGs showed consistent trends, of which 232 and 378 were upregulated and downregulated, respectively. Immune response analysis revealed significant changes in the immune cells associated with MCI and T1DM. Using immune-related genes, DEGs, and machine learning techniques, we identified CD3D in the MCI and T1DM groups. We observed a gradual decline in the cognitive function of mice with T1DM as the disease progressed. CD3D expression increased with increasing disease severity; CD3D primarily affected CD4+ T cells. This study revealed a complex interaction between T1DM and MCI, providing novel insights into the intricate relationship between immune dysregulation and cognitive impairment and expanding our understanding of these two interconnected disorders. These findings will facilitate the development of therapeutic interventions and identification of potential therapeutic targets.","2024","International immunopharmacology"

Soluble CD89-IgA complex (sCD89-IgA) as a type of IgA-IC associated with renal involvement in IgAV, the ability of blood sCD89-IgA as a biomarker to predict renal or multi-organ involvement in children with IgAV is not evident, and this study mainly focused on this. The clinical characteristics and blood samples of 57 pediatric patients with IgAV were collected. ELISA was used to detect plasma IgA-ICs and sCD89-IgA levels. Serum IgA levels were detected by Nephelometry method. Statistical analysis was conducted to analyze the relationship between sex, age, serum IgA levels, plasma IgA-ICs levels, plasma sCD89-IgA levels and the involvement of multiple organs (except skin) including kidneys in these patients. Compared to patients with simple skin involvement, patients with multi-organ involvement, especially kidneys, had higher levels of plasma IgA-ICs and sCD89-IgA, and the statistical difference was significant. In addition, a high level of plasma sCD89-IgA was a high-risk factor for patients to develop multi-organ or renal involvement in addition to the skin. ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC was 0.861 (Sensitivity: 83 %, Specificity: 88 %, p < 0.0001) when plasma sCD89-IgA predicted multi-organ involvement, and AUC 0.926 (Sensitivity: 94 %, Specificity: 88 %, p < 0.0001) for predicting renal involvement.

Children referred to our institution between 2007 and 2023 for POM were reviewed. POM was defined as hydroureteronephrosis with ureteral dilation > 7 mm. We excluded patients with other etiologies for upper tract dilation. Resolution was defined as decrease in hydronephrosis to < 10 mm anteroposterior diameter (APD) or Society for Fetal Urology grade ≤ 2 or ≤ 7 mm in hydroureter. Patients were censored if they underwent surgical intervention or were lost to follow-up before documenting resolution. Kaplan-Meier curves were drawn to illustrate the cumulative resolution rate and determine univariate associations. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to identify significant predictors for early resolution, and Concordance Index (c-index) was calculated. A total of 159 patients were included, with a median index age of 2 months and a median follow-up of 30 months. Of these, 89 patients reached spontaneous resolution during monitoring, and likelihood of surgical indication at 1 year from US was 30%. APD > 15 mm, high-grade hydronephrosis, ureteral dilation > 10 mm, and ureter tortuosity at presentation were associated with a lower likelihood of resolution for individual Kaplan-Meier curves. A Cox regression model trained on these predictors achieved an adjusted c-index of 0.68, and low APD remained associated with a higher likelihood of resolution. Early sonographic features in POM, specifically APD, are associated with the likelihood of spontaneous resolution.

The time to positivity (TTP) of blood culture is postulated to be a prognostic factor in bacteraemia caused by other species. Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the prognostic value of TTP in these patients. The single-centred, retrospective, observational cohort study was conducted between 1 July 2016 and 30 June 2021. All adult emergency department patients with diagnosis of intra-abdominal infection and underwent blood culture collection which yield K. pneumoniae during this period were enrolled. A total of 196 patients were included in the study. The overall 30-day mortality rate was 12.2% (24/196), and the median TTP of the studied cohort was 12.3 h (10.5-15.8 h). TTP revealed a moderate 30-day mortality discriminative ability (area under the curve 0.73, p < 0.001). Compared with the late TTP group (>12 h, N = 109), patients in the early TTP (≤12 h, N = 87) group had a significantly higher risk of 30-day morality (21.8% vs. 4.6%, p < 0.01) and other adverse outcomes. Furthermore, TTP (odds ratio [OR] = 0.79, p = 0.02), Pitt bacteraemia score (OR = 1.30, p = 0.03), and implementation of source control (OR = 0.06, p < 0.01) were identified as independent factors related to 30-day mortality risk in patients with intra-abdominal infection and K. pneumoniae bacteraemia.

We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort study, including AIS with LVO who underwent EVT. Patients were categorized into TyG index groups, calculated as ""(fasting triglyceride [mg/dL] × fasting blood glucose [mg/dL]/2)."" Clinical outcomes were assessed, including poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale [mRS] > 2 [3-6]) at 90 days, early neurological deterioration (END), symptomatic intracranial hemorrhage (sICH), and 90-day mortality after EVT. Logistic regression and restricted cubic splines (RCS) were used to examine the relationship between the TyG index and clinical outcomes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed to evaluate the prognostic capacity of the TyG index. A total of 424 patients were included. Higher TyG levels were associated with worse functional outcome at 90 days (per unit: p = 0.006), sICH (per unit: p = 0.002, T3 versus T1: p = 0.004), and 90-day mortality (T2 versus T1: p = 0.011, T3 versus T1: p = 0.029) in logistic regression. A RCS model revealed a linear association between the TyG index and poor outcome at 90 days, sICH, and 90-day mortality (p for nonlinearity > 0.05). In ROC curve analysis, the traditional risk factors model (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.824, 95% CI: 0.784-0.859) was outperformed by the conventional risk factors + TyG index model (AUC: 0.845, 95% CI: 0.807-0.878) in predicting poor outcome (p = 0.021). A higher TyG index is associated with worse clinical outcomes in LVO-induced AIS patients after EVT.

To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel approach using synthetic LDCT images generated from standard-dose CT (SDCT) scans from the LIDC-IDRI dataset. Our objective is to develop and validate an interpretable radiomics-based model for distinguishing likely benign from likely malignant pulmonary nodules. From a total of 1010 CT images (695 SDCTs and 315 LDCTs), we degraded SDCTs in the sinogram domain and obtained 1950 nodules as the training set. The 675 nodules from the LDCTs were stratified into 50%-50% partitions for validation and testing. Radiomic features were extracted from nodules, and three feature sets were assessed using: a) only shape and size (SS) features, b) all features but SS features, and c) all features. A systematic pipeline was developed to optimize the feature set and evaluate multiple machine learning models. Models were trained using degraded SDCT, validated and tested on the LDCT nodules. Training a logistic regression model using three SS features yielded the most promising results, achieving on the test set mean balanced accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC-ROC scores of 0.81, 0.76, 0.85, and 0.87, respectively. Our study demonstrates the feasibility and effectiveness of using synthetic LDCT images for developing a relatively accurate radiomics-based model in lung nodule classification. This approach addresses challenges associated with LDCT screening, offering potential implications for improving lung cancer detection and reducing false positives.","2024","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

Do force plate measures of quiet standing balance during the sub-acute stage of stroke recovery have concurrent validity (i.e., correlate with functional balance measures) and discriminative ability (i.e., differentiate fallers from non-fallers and/or those with low-moderate versus high risk of falling)? Participants completed one trial of quiet standing with eyes open, lasting for 30 seconds. History of falls was identified retrospectively, based on falls during the acute-care stay. Risk of falling was determined at admission to inpatient rehabilitation using the STRATIFY scale. Mean speeds of centre of pressure along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes, weight-bearing asymmetry, and symmetry index were calculated. Concurrent validity of these measures were quantified against the Berg Balance Scale; their abilities in differentiating fallers from non-fallers, and individuals with low-moderate versus high risk of falling were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Among the measures studied, mean speeds of centre of pressure along the anterior-posterior and medial-lateral axes demonstrated moderate concurrent validity (ρ=-0.490, and -0.440, respectively; p-values≤0.002), while the other two measures did not show sufficient concurrent validity. Weight-bearing asymmetry showed some ability in differentiating fallers from non-fallers (AUC=0.67); however, other measures demonstrated negligible to no discriminative ability. Our findings suggest that speeds of centre of pressure have moderate concurrent validity to quantify balance during the sub-acute stage of stroke; they can be used to better inform rehabilitation practice about the balance ability following a stroke. Weight-bearing asymmetry has some ability to discriminate people with and without a history of falls; however, research is required to identify its ability to discriminate future fallers and non-fallers.","2025","Gait & posture"

Classification and regression models were evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and assessed based on various performance parameters. For the predictive classification task (occurrence of TS), the developed models achieved a maximum area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.76 [0.62-0.88] on the test data, with an F1-score of 0.80 [0.71-0.87]. In cross-validation, the highest AUC reached 0.86 [0.84-0.88], and the highest F1-score was 0.78 [0.75-0.83]. For predicting TS intensity, the regression models demonstrated a minimum mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.76 [1.45-2.06] and a root mean square error (RMSE) of 2.38 [2.06-2.69] on the test set. During cross-validation, the lowest MAE was 1.84 [1.67-2.03], with an RMSE of 2.39 [2.20-2.58]. The supervised machine learning model for estimating the occurrence and intensity of TS in patients undergoing in-office bleaching demonstrated good predictive power. The Gradient Boosting Classifier and Support Vector Machine Regressor algorithms stood out as having the greatest predictive power among those tested. These models can serve as valuable tools for anticipating tooth sensitivity in this patient population, facilitating better post-treatment management and control.","2025","Journal of dentistry"

Poor outcome was defined as mRS > 2 at 12 (SICFAIL, derivation dataset) or 3 months (PREDICT/STRAWINSKI, pooled external validation dataset). Among 412 SICFAIL participants (median age 70 years, quartiles 59-78; 63% male; median NIHSS score 3, quartiles 1-5), 29% had a poor outcome. Area under the curve of the ASTRAL and age/NIHSS were 0.76 (95% CI 0.71-0.81) and 0.77 (95% CI 0.73-0.82), respectively. Copeptin (0.79, 95% CI 0.74-0.84), NT-proBNP (0.80, 95% CI 0.76-0.84), and MR-proANP (0.79, 95% CI 0.75-0.84) significantly improved ASTRAL score's discrimination, calibration, and overall performance. Copeptin improved age/NIHSS model's discrimination, copeptin, MR-proANP, and NT-proBNP improved its calibration and overall performance. In the validation dataset (450 patients, median age 73 years, quartiles 66-81; 54% men; median NIHSS score 8, quartiles 3-14), copeptin was independently associated with various definitions of poor outcome and also mortality. Copeptin did not increase model's discrimination but it did improve calibration and overall model performance. Copeptin, NT-proBNP, and MR-proANP improved modest but consistently the predictive performance of established prognostic scores in patients with mild AIS.

However, there are gaps in our understanding of the role of PER2 in regulating CD4+ T cells beyond its time-keeping function in ulcerative colitis (UC) pathogenesis. Our findings revealed PER2 was predominantly expressed in CD4+ T cells, while it was significantly decreased in the inflamed mucosa and peripheral blood CD4+ T cells of UC patients compared with that in Crohn's disease (CD) patients and healthy controls (HC). Notably, PER2 expression was significantly recovered in UC patients in remission (R-UC) compared to that in active UC patients (A-UC) but not in CD patients. It was negatively correlated with the Ulcerative Colitis Endoscopic Index of Severity (UCEIS), Crohn's Disease Activity Index (CDAI), Simple Endoscopic Score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD), and C-reactive protein (CRP), respectively. Overexpression of PER2 markedly inhibited IFN-γ production in UC CD4+ T cells. RNA-seq analysis showed that overexpression of PER2 could repress the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase 12 (ADAM12), a costimulatory molecule that determines Th1 cell fate. Mechanistically, cleavage under targets and tagmentation (CUT&Tag) analysis revealed that PER2 down-regulated ADAM12 expression by reducing its binding activity, thereby suppressing IFN-γ production in UC CD4+ T cells. Additionally, our data further demonstrated that ADAM12 was upregulated in CD4+ T cells and inflamed mucosa of A-UC patients compared to HC. Our study reveals a critical role of PER2 in regulating CD4+ T cell differentiation and highlights its potential as a therapeutic target for UC treatment.","2024","Mucosal immunology"

Forty-five infants with CMA were compared to 45 infants with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) and 45 healthy controls. For all participants, Cow's Milk-related Symptom Score (CoMiSS) was documented, and sEDN level with hematological parameters were measured before starting elimination diet. Receiver operation characteristic (ROC) curve identified sEDN > 14 ng/mL and CoMiSS > 9 as the optimal cut-off points to discriminate CMA from other groups with sensitivity 86.67%, 97.78% and specificity 60.00%, 78.89% respectively. Additionally, absolute neutrophil count (ANC) showed the highest sensitivity and specificity (80.0% and 78.89%) among hematological parameters. Although CoMiSS and ANC showed a significant positive correlation with sEDN in CMA group, CoMiSS was the only significant predictor for sEDN in multivariate linear regression. sEDN showed high sensitivity in discriminating infants with and without CMA. Therefore, it is suggested as a potential biomarker for CMA diagnosis. Also, ANC should be closely monitored in these infants. CMA presents with high heterogeneity, which complicates the diagnosis especially non-IgE-mediated and mixed types. So, oral food challenge continues to be the gold standard for its diagnosis. ROC curve identified CoMiSS > 9 as the best cut-off point to identify CMA. However, CoMiSS is a good awareness tool for CMA but not a diagnostic tool. sEDN level was significantly higher in infants with CMA with a good diagnostic performance in differentiating them than those without CMA. So, it is suggested as a potential biomarker for CMA diagnosis. ANC could have a role in CMA diagnosis and differentiating it from FGIDs.","2024","Pediatric research"

A total of 4354 participants from the NHANES (2003-2020) with complete information were randomly divided into a training set and a test set. Twelve ML algorithms, including random forest (RF), XGBoost (XGB), logistic regression (LR), GaussianNB (GNB), ridge regression (RR), support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), decision tree (DT), AdaBoost (AB), Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT), Voting Classifier (VC), and K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN), were constructed for IR prediction using the training set. Among these models, the RF algorithm had the best predictive performance, showing an accuracy of 80.14%, an AUC of 0.856, and an F1 score of 0.74 in the test set. We embedded three interpretable methods, the permutation feature importance analysis, partial dependence plot (PDP), and Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) in RF model for model interpretation. Urinary Ba, urinary Mo, blood Pb, and blood Cd levels were identified as the main influencers of IR. Within a specific range, urinary Ba (0.56-3.56 µg/L) and urinary Mo (1.06-20.25 µg/L) levels exhibited the most pronounced upwards trend with the risk of IR, while blood Pb (0.05-2.81 µg/dL) and blood Cd (0.24-0.65 µg/L) levels showed a declining trend with IR. The findings on the synergistic effects demonstrated that controlling urinary Ba levels might be more crucial for the management of IR. The SHAP decision plot offered personalized care for IR based on heavy metal control. In conclusion, by utilizing interpretable ML approaches, we emphasize the predictive value of heavy metals for IR, especially Ba, Mo, Pb, and Cd.","2024","Biological trace element research"

The total morphine consumption in the QP001 group, versus placebo group, was also significantly decreased over the following 48 h (P < 0.001). The QP001 group, versus placebo, showed a significant decrease in the effective pressing times of the analgesic pump, morphine relief analgesia ratio over the 24 h and 48 h periods and the area under the curve for pain intensity-time as well as a significant prolonged in the time of first pressing the analgesic pump and the time of first morphine rescue analgesia (P < 0.001). The QP001 groups, versus placebo, show no significant difference in adverse events, but the incidence of adverse drug reactions decreased (59.4% vs. 75.8%, P = 0.023). QP001 provides analgesia and reduces opioid consumption in patients with moderate to severe pain after orthopaedic surgery, with a favorable safety profile.","2024","Inflammopharmacology"

This study aims to enhance the identification of candidates for device-aided therapies (DAT) using artificial intelligence (AI), addressing the need for improved treatment selection in advanced PD stages. This national, multicenter, cross-sectional, observational study involved 1086 PD patients across Spain. Machine learning (ML) algorithms, including CatBoost, support vector machine (SVM), and logistic regression (LR), were evaluated for their ability to identify potential DAT candidates based on clinical and demographic data. The CatBoost algorithm demonstrated superior performance in identifying DAT candidates, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95, sensitivity of 0.91, and specificity of 0.88. It outperformed other ML models in balanced accuracy and negative predictive value. The model identified 23 key features as predictors for suitability for DAT, highlighting the importance of daily ""off"" time, doses of oral levodopa/day, and PD duration. Considering the 5-2-1 criteria, the algorithm identified a decision threshold for DAT candidates as > 4 times levodopa tablets taken daily and/or ≥1.8 h in daily ""off"" time. The study developed a highly discriminative CatBoost model for identifying PD patients candidates for DAT, potentially improving timely and accurate treatment selection. This AI approach offers a promising tool for neurologists, particularly those less experienced with DAT, to optimize referral to Movement Disorder Units.","2025","Computers in biology and medicine"

We prospectively enrolled 65 patients with TAO (41 active, 82 eyes; 24 inactive, 48 eyes). Twenty-two active patients completed the GC treatment and follow-up assessment, including 15 patients (30 eyes) and 7 patients (14 eyes), defined as responsive and unresponsive, respectively. Model-free (time to peak [TTP], area under the curve [AUC], and Slopemax) and model-based (Ktrans, Kep, and Ve) parameters of EOMs in embedded simplified histogram analyses were calculated and compared between groups. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was used to identify the independent predictors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance. Active patients exhibited significantly higher TTP at the 10th percentile (-10th), TTP-mean, and TTP at the 90th percentile (-90th); AUC-10th, AUC-mean, AUC-90th, and AUC-max; Ktrans-10th and Ktrans-mean; and Ve-10th, Ve-mean, Ve-90th, and Ve-max than inactive patients (P < 0.05). Responsive patients exhibited significantly lower TTP-min; higher Ktrans-mean and Ktrans-max; and higher Kep-10th, Kep-mean, and Kep-max than unresponsive patients (P < 0.05). TTP-mean and Ve-mean were independent variables for determining disease activity (P = 0.017 and 0.022, respectively). A combination of the two parameters could determine active TAO with moderate performance (AUROC = 0.687). TTP-min and Ktrans-mean were independent predictors of the response to GCs (P = 0.023 and 0.004, respectively), uniting which could determine the response to GCs with decent performance (AUROC = 0.821). DCE-MRI-derived model-free and model-based parameters of EOMs can assist in the evaluation of TAO. In particular, TTP-mean and Ve-mean could be useful for determining the activity of TAO, whereas TTP-min and Ktrans-mean could be promising biomarkers for determining the response to GCs.","2024","Korean journal of radiology"

A prospective, multicenter, nonrandomized study examined 751 consecutive BTK CTOs in 497 patients treated with endovascular therapy in 16 Japanese medical centers from April 2021 to March 2022. The cohort was classified into 2 groups: an S-GC group and a failed guidewire crossing group. The J-BTK CTO score, which assigned one point to ""Blunt type at the proximal entry point,"" one point to ""Calcification at the proximal entry point,"" one point to ""Reference vessel diameter <2.0 mm,"" one point to ""CTO length ≥200 mm,"" and two points to ""No outflow of the target vessel,"" was used to categorize BTK CTOs into 4 grades with varying probabilities of S-GC: grade A (J-BTK CTO score of 0 and 1), grade B (score of 2 and 3), grade C (score of 4 and 5), and grade D (score of 6). Rates of S-GC in each grade (grades A, B, C, and D) were 97.5%, 89.1%, 62.5%, and 27.3%, respectively. The area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for S-GC was 0.8304. Although the previous J-BTK CTO study enrolled only de novo lesions, both de novo and restenotic lesions were evaluated in this study. De novo lesions have a lower chance of S-GC (odds ratio: 0.24, 95% confidence interval: 0.09-0.67) in the multivariate analysis, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of the modified J-BTK CTO score, which additionally assigned two points to ""De novo lesion,"" was 0.846. The modified J-BTK CTO score showed an appropriate calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = .957).

This prospective study enrolled 143 women (II-III breast cancer), who underwent multi-b-value diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) in 3-T magnetic resonance (MR) before NAC. The patient cohort was partitioned into a training set (consisting of 100 patients, of which 36 demonstrated a pathologic complete response [pCR]) and a test set (featuring 43 patients, 16 of whom exhibited pCR). Utilizing the training set, predictive models for pCR, were constructed using different parameters: whole-tumor radiomics (ModelWH), diffusion-weighted habitat-imaging (ModelHabitats), conventional MRI features (ModelCF), along with combined models ModelHabitats+CF. The performance of these models was assessed based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and calibration slope. In the prediction of pCR, ModelWH, ModelHabitats, ModelCF, and ModelHabitats+CF achieved AUCs of 0.733, 0.722, 0.705, and 0.756 respectively, within the training set. These scores corresponded to AUCs of 0.625, 0.801, 0.700, and 0.824 respectively in the test set. The DeLong test revealed no significant difference between ModelWH and ModelHabitats (P = 0.182), between ModelHabitats and ModelHabitats+CF (P = 0.113). The habitat model we developed, incorporating first-order features along with conventional MRI features, has demonstrated accurate predication of pCR prior to NAC. This model holds the potential to augment decision-making processes in personalized treatment strategies for breast cancer.","2024","Academic radiology"

However, since there is no worldwide-implemented standard test for M. leprae infection, detection of infection in asymptomatic individuals remains a major challenge for control programs in endemic areas. In previous studies, we developed and field-tested a lateral flow assay (LFA) quantitatively detecting human IgM against M. leprae-specific phenolic glycolipid I (anti-PGL-I), a marker for both active and past infection. This rapid test utilizes luminescent, background-free, up-converting reporter particles (UCP) and immunochromatography (i.e. the UCP-LF test platform) for accurate quantitation of anti-PGL-I IgM without operator bias. The aim of this study was to evaluate the final version of this quantitative UCP-based rapid test (i.e. PGL-I QURapid), using serum and fingerstick blood (FSB). The test comprises a lateral flow strip, in a standard plastic or biodegradable cassette. It can be provided with a humanized, recombinant control to monitor test performance and calculate accurate anti-PGL-I IgM levels. The performance of this QUR-test was assessed using serum and FSB from patients with leprosy (n = 214), tuberculosis (n = 20), buruli ulcer (n = 19), leishmaniasis (n = 14), non-tuberculous mycobacterial (n = 35) infections, as well as healthy Dutch individuals (n = 710) and humanized, recombinant anti-PGL-I IgM antibodies. Plot receiver operating characteristic curves were created and sensitivity (Sn), specificity (Sp) and the area under the curve were calculated to evaluate test performance. Test results classified multibacillary leprosy patients with 95.0% Sn and 100% Sp using serum and 91.5% Sn and 99.8% Sp using FSB. Qualitative test results could be read after 2 min flow time, with accurate quantitation from 10 min onwards. The new anti-PGL-I IgM control supports production of batches with predetermined seropositivity thresholds and monitoring of the PGL-I QUR-test in various settings. The operational version of the PGL-I QURapid with point-of-care applicability, meets the WHO target product profile criteria.

The study aims to evaluate the comparative predictive performance of vertebral bone quality (VBQ) score and Hounsfield units (HU) value in forecasting NVCF after surgery. This study retrospectively analyzed patients who underwent PVP/PKP at our institution between 2020 and 2021. The VBQ score and HU value were obtained from preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) scans, respectively. Subsequently, the forecasting capabilities of these two parameters were assessed by contrasting their receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. A total of 303 eligible patients (56 with NVCF and 247 without) were identified in the study. Six relevant literature factors were identified and included in the multivariate analysis revealed that lower HU value (OR = 0.967, 95% CI = 0.953-0.981, P < 0.001) and higher VBQ score (OR = 3.964, 95% CI = 2.369-6.631, P < 0.001) emerged as independent predictors of NCVF occurrence.

And, a statistically significant negative correlation was observed between the VBQ score and the T-score (r = -0.529, P < 0.001). In patients undergoing PVP/PKP, VBQ score, and HU value are independently associated with the occurrence of NVCF.

Clinical models are excellent at identifying high-risk patients, but leave uncertainty amongst moderate-risk patients. Can a multiple blood biomarker model of PAH, using previously described biomarkers, improve risk discrimination over current models? Using a multiplex enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, we measured N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP), soluble suppressor of tumorigenicity, IL-6, endostatin, galectin 3, hepatoma derived growth factor, and insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBP1-7) in training (n = 1,623), test (n = 696), and validation (n = 237) cohorts. Clinical variables and biomarkers were evaluated by principal component analysis. NT-proBNP was not included to develop a model independent of NT-proBNP. Unsupervised k-means clustering classified participants into clusters. Transplant-free survival by cluster was examined using Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard regressions. Hazard by cluster was compared with NT-proBNP, Registry to Evaluate Early and Long-Term PAH Disease Management (REVEAL), and European Society of Cardiology and European Respiratory Society risk models alone and combined clinical and biomarker models. The algorithm generated five clusters with good risk discrimination using six biomarkers, weight, height, and age at PAH diagnosis. In the test and validation cohorts, the biomarker model alone performed equivalent to REVEAL (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.74). Adding the biomarker model to the European Society of Cardiology and European Respiratory Society score and REVEAL score improved the European Society of Cardiology and European Respiratory Society score and REVEAL score. The best overall model was the biomarker model adjusted for NT-proBNP with the best C statistic, Akaike information criterion, and calibration for the adjusted model compared with either the biomarker or NT-proBNP model alone. In this study, a multibiomarker model alone was equivalent to current PAH clinical mortality risk prediction models and improved performance when combined and added to NT-proBNP. Clinical risk scores offer excellent predictive models, but require multiple tests; adding blood biomarkers to models can improve prediction or can enable more frequent, noninvasive monitoring of risk in PAH to support therapeutic decision-making.","2024","Chest"

The data contain 621 employees' information (e.g., demographics, job information and client information served by employees) hired between 2011 and 2021 (56.5% turned over during the study period). Six ML methods (i.e., logistic regression, elastic net, random forest [RF], gradient boosting machine [GBM], neural network and support vector machine) were used to predict turnover, along with graphical and statistical tools to interpret predictive relationship patterns and potential interactions. The result suggests that RF and GBM led to better prediction according to specificity, sensitivity and area under the curve (>0.8). The turnover predictors (e.g., past work years, work hours, wage, age, exempt status, educational degree, marital status and employee type) were identified, including those that may be unique to the mental health employee population (e.g., training hours and the proportion of clients with schizophrenia diagnosis). It also revealed nonlinear and nonmonotonic predictive relationships (e.g., wage and employee age), as well as interaction effects, such that past work years interact with other variables in turnover prediction. The study indicates that ML methods showed the predictability of mental health employee turnover using human resources data. The identified predictors and the nonlinear and interactive relationships shed light on developing new predictive models for turnover that warrant further investigations.","2024","International journal of mental health nursing"

One study used two different CGMs (Abbott Freestyle Libre Pro and Dexcom G4 Platinum) whereas the other study used only Dexcom. We calculated the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for glucose for each 2-h postmeal period and compared within-subject, within-CGM responses to duplicate presented meals using linear correlations, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman analyses. Individual variability of interstitial glucose responses to duplicate meals were also compared with different meals using standard deviations (SDs). There were weak-to-moderate positive linear correlations between within-subject iAUCs for duplicate meals [Abbott r = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38, 0.54, P < 0.0001 and Dexcom r = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.50, P < 0.0001], with low within-participant reliability indicated by ICC (Abbott 0.28, Dexcom 0.17). Bland-Altman analyses indicated wide limits of agreement (LoA) (Abbott -29.8 to 28.4 mg/dL and Dexcom -29.4 to 32.1 mg/dL) but small bias of mean iAUCs for duplicate meals (Abbott -0.7 mg/dL and Dexcom 1.3 mg/dL).

In a randomized, double-blind, 3-period crossover (2-wk washout), controlled trial, we compared the vascular effects of 3 high-saturated-fat high-sucrose (HFHS) meals containing either our specific plant-protein blend, or milk protein, or without added protein. The trial was conducted on 29 healthy adults aged >65 y presenting ≥2 cardiometabolic risk factors. Postprandial vascular function was evaluated at fasting, 3 h, and 5 h postprandially, using brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD), hand microvascular reactivity (using Flowmetry Laser Doppler, FLD), and finger reactive hyperemia index (using Peripheral Arterial Tonometry, RHI). Immune cell count and gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were also assessed postprandially.

A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted following PRISMA-DTA guidelines. This protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42023402093). A comprehensive search of electronic databases identified studies published up to 1 November 2024, comparing the ARCHITECT HCV Ag assay to an HCV-RNA reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, and likelihood ratios were pooled using a random-effects model within the MIDAS module of Stata software. Study quality was assessed using QUADAS-2. Heterogeneity was evaluated using the Q statistic, quantified using the I², and further explored through meta-regression. Ten studies (n = 494 participants) met inclusion criteria. The Abbott ARCHITECT HCV Ag assay demonstrated high sensitivity [91%, 95% confidence interval (CI): 76-97%] and specificity (99%, 95% CI: 99-100%). The positive likelihood ratio (PLR) was 81.20 (95% CI: 12.34-534.36), and the negative likelihood ratio (NLR) was 0.09 (95% CI: 0.03-0.27). The area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-SROC) was 99% (95% CI 98-100%). In regions with high HCV prevalence (≥ 10%), the test accurately confirmed active HCV infection in over 90% of cases. However, confirmatory testing remains necessary in low-prevalence settings (≤ 5%). The assay demonstrated an excellent ability to identify individuals without HCV infection, with a low false-negative rate (≤ 2%) regardless of HCV prevalence. Heterogeneity analysis revealed moderate to substantial variation in test performance (I² = 72.09% for sensitivity, 35.47% for PLR, and 78.33% for NLR). QUADAS-2 applicability concerns predicted heterogeneity, but differences were likely insignificant due to minimal variations and limited studies. The Abbott ARCHITECT HCV Ag assay exhibited promising accuracy in detecting active HCV infection among PLWHB.

Considering glucose hypometabolism is another marker of neurodegeneration, we quantified metabolic resilience (MR) based on Fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET) and investigated its clinical implications. We quantified the MR and other resilience metrics, including brain resilience (BR) and cognitive resilience (CR), using partial least squares path modeling from the ADNI database. A linear mixed-effects model and a Cox proportional hazards model were used to identify the impact of each resilience on longitudinal cognitive function and conversion to dementia, respectively. A total of 848 participants were included in this study. All resilience metrics (CR, BR, and MR) were associated with slower cognitive decline. Results from the ANOVA test, AIC and BIC values showed that the additional inclusion of MR improved the performances of the linear mixed effect models. In survival analysis, all resilience variables were negatively associated with the risk of conversion to dementia. In line with the results of the linear mixed effects models, the additional inclusion of MR into the models with different resilience variables increased the C-index. Relative preservation of brain glucose metabolism is a valuable predictor of future cognitive decline and conversion to dementia, adding value to existing resilience metrics. While the utility of FDG PET in clinical settings is limited by cost and accessibility, it might have potential usefulness as a prognostic marker, especially in a context of resilience.","2024","The American journal of geriatric psychiatry : official journal of the American Association for Geriatric Psychiatry"

The incorporation of RRT-mean (AUC, 0.77) alongside platelet count (AUC, 0.75) resulted in an AUC of 0.84. When including healthy control participants, RRT-mean had an adjusted OR of 12.4 and the AUC of the combined model (RRT-mean and platelet count) was 0.90. Prolonged RRT values and low platelet count were significantly associated with the presence of PVT in cirrhotic participants. RRT values derived from 4D Flow MRI may have potential clinical relevance in the management of PVT. 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.","2024","Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI"

Traditional biomarkers are numerous but exhibit heterogeneity within populations. For comprehensively utilizing the ICI-related biomarkers, we aim to conduct multidimensional feature selection and deep learning model construction. We used statistical and machine learning methods to map features of different levels to next-generation sequencing gene expression. We integrated genes from different sources into the feature input of a deep learning model, by means of self-attention mechanism. We performed feature selection at the single-cell sequencing level, PD-L1 (CD274) analysis level, tumor mutational burden (TMB)/mismatch repair (MMR) level, and somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) level, obtaining 96 feature genes. Based on the pan-cancer dataset, we trained a multi-task deep learning model. We tested the model in the bladder urothelial carcinoma testing set 1 (AUC = 0.62, n = 298), bladder urothelial carcinoma testing set 2 (AUC = 0.66, n = 89), non-small cell lung cancer testing set (AUC = 0.85, n = 27), and skin cutaneous melanoma testing set (AUC = 0.71, n = 27). Our study demonstrates the potential of the deep learning model for integrating multidimensional features in predicting the outcome of ICI.

Therefore, an alternative to body mass index should be considered for prediction of lean-NAFLD. This study aimed to use representative visceral fat links with other laboratory parameters using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method to construct a predictive model for lean-NAFLD. This retrospective cross-sectional analysis enrolled 2325 subjects with BMI < 24 kg/m2 from medical records of 51,271 examinees who underwent a routine health check-up. They were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a ratio of 1:1. The LASSO-derived prediction model used LASSO regression to select 23 clinical and laboratory factors. The discrimination and calibration abilities were evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and calibration curves. The performance of the LASSO model was compared with the fatty liver index (FLI) model. The LASSO-derived model included four variables-visceral fat, triglyceride levels, HDL-C-C levels, and waist hip ratio-and demonstrated superior performance in predicting lean-NAFLD with high discriminatory ability (AUC, 0.8416; 95% CI: 0.811-0.872) that was comparable with the FLI model. Using a cut-off of 0.1484, moderate sensitivity (75.69%) and specificity (79.86%), as well as high negative predictive value (95.9%), were achieved in the LASSO model. In addition, with normal WC subgroup analysis, the LASSO model exhibits a trend of higher accuracy compared to FLI (cut-off 15.45). We developed a LASSO-derived predictive model with the potential for use as an alternative tool for predicting lean-NAFLD in clinical settings.","2024","Annals of medicine"

No studies about dura mater invasion have been conducted specifically in acromegaly patients. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the relationship between histologically dural invasion and the main features of GH-secreting adenomas. Methods: This retrospective study included all consecutive acromegaly patients who underwent neurosurgery at our university hospital between 2017 and 2020. The following data were collected: (1) clinical, biochemical and morphological data at diagnosis, at three months, one year after neurosurgery, and at last follow-up; (2) pathological features (dura mater invasion, immunohistochemical analyses, proliferation index Ki-67, p53, and granulation pattern); and (3) radiological features on magnetic resonance images. Results: Of 35 acromegaly patients, 11 had dural invasion (INV+ 31%) and 24 did not (INV- 69%). GH levels at diagnosis were greater in INV+ patients (p = 0.02), and a GH value > 27 ng/mL was able to distinguish INV+ patients (Sensitivity 80%, Specificity 73%, AUC 0.760, p = 0.006). Indeed, patients with GH > 27 ng/mL at diagnosis had a tenfold greater risk of dura mater invasion (OR 10.7; 95% CI 1.74-65.27, p = 0.005). No differences were found in the other clinical, biochemical, morphological, radiological and pathological features. Regarding remission likelihood, IGF-1 levels at diagnosis were lower in cured patients (p = 0.03). Conclusions: The GH level at diagnosis is the only parameter significantly associated with dura mater invasion. Lower IGF-1 levels at diagnosis are significantly associated with remission one year after surgery.","2024","Journal of clinical medicine"

To develop a CAD system, this study aims to automatically classify GI disorders utilizing various deep learning methodologies. The proposed system features a three-stage lightweight architecture, consisting of a feature extractor using PSE-CNN, a feature selector employing PCA, and a classifier based on DELM. The framework, designed with only 24 layers and 1.25 million parameters, is employed on the largest dataset, GastroVision, containing 8000 images of 27 GI disorders. To improve visual clarity, a sequential preprocessing strategy is implemented. The model's robustness is evaluated through 5-fold cross-validation. Additionally, several XAI methods, namely Grad-CAM, heatmaps, saliency maps, SHAP, and activation feature maps, are used to explore the model's interpretability. Statistical significance is ensured by calculating the p-value, demonstrating the framework's reliability. The proposed model PSE-CNN-PCA-DELM has achieved outstanding results in the first stage, categorizing the diseases' positions into three primary classes, with average accuracy (97.24 %), precision (97.33 ± 0.01 %), recall (97.24 ± 0.01 %), F1-score (97.33 ± 0.01 %), ROC-AUC (99.38 %), and AUC-PR (98.94 %).

Our objective was to develop a model specifically tailored for oral and esophageal cancers. From 1996 to 2007, a total of 431,460 subjects aged 20 and older without a history of cancer at baseline were included and were monitored for an average duration of 7.3 years in Taiwan, China. A total of 704 cases of oral and esophageal cancers were detected. We utilized both univariate and multivariate COX regression for screening predictors and constructing the model. We evaluated the goodness of fit of the model based on discriminatory accuracy, Harrell's C-index, and calibration. Finally, we developed a Cox regression model using the twelve most significant variables: age, gender, alcohol consumption, betel chewing, smoking status, history of oral ulceration, educational level, marital status, oropharynx status, family history of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, volume ratio of blood cell, and gamma-glutamyl transferase. The AUC (area under the curve) for the complete model was 0.82. Additionally, the C-index was 0.807 (with a 95 % confidence interval ranging from 0.789 to 0.824) and internal calibration results demonstrated that the model performed well.

We used data from BIOSTAT-CHF including patients with a left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) ≤40% at baseline who had LVEF re-assessed at 9 months. HFimpEF was defined as a LVEF >40% and a LVEF ≥10% increase from baseline at 9 months. We validated findings in the ASIAN-HF registry. The primary outcome was a composite of time to HF rehospitalization or all-cause mortality. In BIOSTAT-CHF, about 20% of patients developed HFimpEF, that was associated with a lower primary event rate of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 0.52, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.28-0.97, p = 0.040) and the composite endpoint (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.30-0.70, p < 0.001) compared with patients who remained in persistent HF with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF). The findings were similar in the ASIAN-HF (HR 0.40, 95% CI 0.18-0.89, p = 0.024, and HR 0.29, 95% CI 0.17-0.48, p < 0.001). Five independently common predictors for HFimpEF in both BIOSTAT-CHF and ASIAN-HF were female sex, absence of ischaemic heart disease, higher LVEF, smaller left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic diameter at baseline. A predictive model combining only five predictors (absence of ischaemic heart disease and left bundle branch block, smaller left ventricular end-systolic and left atrial diameter, and higher platelet count) for HFimpEF in the BIOSTAT-CHF achieved an area under the curve of 0.772 and 0.688 in the ASIAN-HF (due to missing left atrial diameter and platelet count). Approximately 20-30% of patients with HFrEF improved to HFimpEF within 1 year with better clinical outcomes. In addition, the predictive model with clinical predictors could more accurately predict HFimpEF in patients with HFrEF.","2024","European journal of heart failure"

Machine-learning models, including decision trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), were employed to create a risk prediction tool for ICU admission. Subsequently, sensitivity analysis was conducted to compare the accuracy, predictive power, sensitivity, and specificity of these models, with differences analyzed using the Wilcoxon test. The XGBoost algorithm demonstrated superior efficiency, achieving an accuracy rate of 85%, sensitivity of 42%, specificity of 97%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 86.7%. Notably, the estimated prevalence of ICU utilization by the model (11.6%) differed from the prevalence of ICU use from the study (21.52%). The developed risk engine yielded positive results, emphasizing the need to optimize intensive care bed utilization and objectively identify high-risk pregnant women requiring these services. This approach promises to enhance the effective and efficient management of pregnant women, particularly in resource-constrained regions worldwide.

This study aims to investigate the non-inferiority of the immunohistochemistry-alone model in classifying ECs compared to the standard genomic profiling-based model in terms of oncologic outcomes. All preoperative uterine-confined ECs undergoing surgical staging were retrospectively included. Patients classified by IHC-M were stratified into: MMR-proficient (MMRp), p53 wild type (p53wt) and estrogen receptor (ER) positive, 2) MMRp, p53wt and ER-negative, 3) MMRd, and 4) p53abn. A case-control comparison was performed between the IHC-M and GP-M cohorts. Then, a propensity-matched analysis was performed: ECs classified by IHC-M were matched in a 3:1 ratio with patients classified by GP-M. 1587 patients with EC were included. The Kaplan-Meier survival curves for disease-free survival and overall survival demonstrated that the two models performed similarly in risk-stratifying the study population (p < 0.0001). Moreover, the AUC-ROC showed overlapping results: 0.77 (0.66-0.87) for IHC-M and 0.72 (0.63-0.81) for GP-M, indicating that both models were able to successfully identify patients at high-risk and low-risk of disease recurrence/progression. The IHC-M showed overlapping classification performance compared to the GP-M in terms of oncologic outcomes. This study may lay the basis to further investigate the real-life clinical impact of POLE sequencing in molecular classification and the potential stand-alone prognostic role of ER status for further allocation of EC patients into risk classes.","2024","Gynecologic oncology"

Functional connectivity analysis, utilizing functional magnetic resonance imaging data, has been demonstrated to offer invaluable biomarkers conducive to clinical diagnosis. However, previous studies mainly focus on traditional machine learning methods or hand-crafted neural networks, which may not fully capture the spatial topological relationship between brain regions. This paper proposes an evolutionary algorithm (EA) based graph neural architecture search (GNAS) method. EA-GNAS has the ability to search for high-performance graph neural networks for schizophrenia spectrum disorder prediction. Moreover, we adopt GNNExplainer to investigate the explainability of the acquired architectures, ensuring that the model's predictions are both accurate and comprehensible. The results suggest that the graph neural network model, derived using genetic algorithm search, outperforms under five-fold cross-validation, achieving a fitness of 0.1850. Relative to conventional machine learning and other deep learning approaches, the proposed method yields superior accuracy, F1 score, and AUC values of 0.8246, 0.8438, and 0.8258, respectively. Based on a multi-site dataset from schizophrenia spectrum disorder patients, the findings reveal an enhancement over prior methods, advancing our comprehension of brain function and potentially offering a biomarker for diagnosing schizophrenia spectrum disorder.","2024","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

The primary outcome was incident diabetes (fasting glucose [FG] ≥7.0 mmol/L or hypoglycemic medication use in MESA; FG ≥7.0 mmol/L or 2-h glucose ≥11.1 mmol/L in an oral glucose tolerance test [OGTT] in ACT NOW). Secondary outcomes were changes in FG and HOMA-IR in MESA, and OGTT-glucose area under the curve (AUCglucose) and Matsuda insulin sensitivity index (ISI) in ACT NOW. In MESA, a higher C-I'/C-I was associated with lower risk of diabetes (n = 564 events; HR 0.87 [95% CI 0.79, 0.95] per SD; P = 0.0036; median follow-up, 9 years), and smaller increases (follow-up adjusted for baseline) in FG (-0.5%; P < 0.0001) and HOMA-IR (-2.9%; P = 0.011) after adjusting for baseline clinical and demographic covariates, including plasma triglycerides and HDL cholesterol.

The model was then evaluated on the RTOG 0933 dataset by comparing the treating physician (TP) contours to blinded IO and DL contours using Dice and Haussdorf distance (HD) agreement metrics as well as evaluating differences in dose to hippocampi when TP vs. IO vs. DL contours are used for planning. The specificity and sensitivity of the DL model to capture planning discrepancies was quantified using criteria of HD > 7 mm and Dmax hippocampi > 17 Gy. The DL model showed greater agreement with IO contours compared to TP contours (DL:IO L/R Dice 74%/73%, HD 4.86/4.74; DL:TP L/R Dice 62%/65%, HD 7.23/6.94, all p < 0.001). Thirty percent of contours and 53 % of dose plans failed QA. The DL model achieved an AUC L/R 0.80/0.79 on the contour QA task via Haussdorff comparison and AUC of 0.91 via Dmax comparison. The false negative rate was 17.2%/20.5% (contours) and 5.8% (dose). False negative cases tended to demonstrate a higher DL:IO Dice agreement (L/R p = 0.42/0.03) and better qualitative visual agreement compared with true positive cases.

Plasma samples were collected from 44 cats with various tumours, 24 cats with other diseases and 10 healthy controls. A follow-up study was conducted in three tumour-bearing patients. All cfDNA concentrations were quantified via real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), which provided short and long fragments of a newly identified feline LINE-1 gene. We found that cfDNA levels were significantly higher in cats with various tumours than in those with other diseases or healthy controls. The cfDNA concentration was not correlated with serum amyloid A (SAA) levels. Cats with tumours exhibited elevated cfDNA levels that predicted tumour-bearing with a sensitivity and specificity of 50.5% and 91.2%, respectively (AUC 0.736; p < 0.001). In lymphoma cases, cats with high cfDNA levels had significantly shorter survival times than those with low cfDNA levels (median: 33 days vs. 178 days; p = 0.003). In addition, the cfDNA levels of the three patients correlated with clinical status during follow-up.

Identifying high-risk servicemembers before they leave service could help target preventive interventions. To develop a model based on administrative data for regular US Army soldiers that can predict suicides 1 to 120 months after leaving active service. In this prognostic study, a consolidated administrative database was created for all regular US Army soldiers who left service from 2010 through 2019. Machine learning models were trained to predict suicides over the next 1 to 120 months in a random 70% training sample. Validation was implemented in the remaining 30%. Data were analyzed from March 2023 through March 2024. The outcome was suicide in the National Death Index. Predictors came from administrative records available before leaving service on sociodemographics, Army career characteristics, psychopathologic risk factors, indicators of physical health, social networks and supports, and stressors. Of the 800 579 soldiers in the cohort (84.9% male; median [IQR] age at discharge, 26 [23-33] years), 2084 suicides had occurred as of December 31, 2019 (51.6 per 100 000 person-years). A lasso model assuming consistent slopes over time discriminated as well over all but the shortest risk horizons as more complex stacked generalization ensemble machine learning models. Test sample area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.87 (SE = 0.06) for suicides in the first month after leaving service to 0.72 (SE = 0.003) for suicides over 120 months. The 10% of soldiers with highest predicted risk accounted for between 30.7% (SE = 1.8) and 46.6% (SE = 6.6) of all suicides across horizons. Calibration was for the most part better for the lasso model than the super learner model (both estimated over 120-month horizons.) Net benefit of a model-informed prevention strategy was positive compared with intervene-with-all or intervene-with-none strategies over a range of plausible intervention thresholds. Sociodemographics, Army career characteristics, and psychopathologic risk factors were the most important classes of predictors. These results demonstrated that a model based on administrative variables available at the time of leaving active Army service can predict suicides with meaningful accuracy over the subsequent decade. However, final determination of cost-effectiveness would require information beyond the scope of this report about intervention content, costs, and effects over relevant horizons in relation to the monetary value placed on preventing suicides.","2024","JAMA psychiatry"

This study set out to elucidate the biological functions and prognostic role of ferroptosis-related long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) based on a synthetic analysis of competing endogenous RNA networks in ccRCC. Ferroptosis-related genes were obtained from the FerrDb database. The expression data and matched clinical information of lncRNAs, miRNAs and mRNAs from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database were obtained to identify differentially expressed RNAs. The lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA ceRNA network was established utilizing the common miRNAs that were predicted in the RNAHybrid, StarBase and TargetScan databases. Then, using progressive univariate Cox regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression analysis of gene expression data and clinical information, a ferroptosis-related lncRNA prognosis signature was constructed based on the lncRNAs in ceRNA. Finally, the influence of independent lncRNAs on ccRCC was explored. A total of 35 ferroptosis-related mRNAs, 356 lncRNAs and 132 miRNAs were sorted out after differential expression analysis in the TCGA-KIRC. Subsequently, overlapping lncRNA-miRNA and miRNA-mRNA interactions among the RNAHybrid, StarBase and TargetScan databases were constructed and identified; then a ceRNA network with 77 axes related to ferroptosis was established utilizing mutual miRNAs in 2 interaction networks as nodes. Next, a 6-ferroptosis-lncRNA signature including PVT1, CYTOR, MIAT, SNHG17, LINC00265, and LINC00894 was identified in the training set. Kaplan-Meier analysis, PCA, t-SNE analysis, risk score curve, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were performed to confirm the validity of the signature in the training set and verified in the validation set. Finally, single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) and ESTIMATE (Estimation of STromal and Immune cells in MAlignant Tumor tissues using Expression data) analysis showed that the signature was related to immune cell infiltration. Our research underlines the role of the 6-ferroptosis-lncRNA signature as a predictor of prognosis and a therapeutic alternative for ccRCC.","2024","Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University"

Samples were collected in a Phase 4 study of oral minocycline plus rifampicin versus linezolid showing minocycline plus rifampicin to be non-inferior to linezolid. Antibiotics were assayed by HPLC or LC-MS, and a population PK model was developed using Pmetrics. The association between PK/PD indices and patient outcomes was explored. A three-compartment model (with an absorption compartment) with first-order input and elimination best described the data for the three drugs. No covariates were included in the final model. The population median values (95% credibility limits) of the clearance and volume of distribution were 7.412 L/h (5.121-8.361) and 14.155 L (6.799-33.901) for minocycline, 5.683 L/h (3.703-7.726) and 7.736 L (6.031-8.948) for rifampicin, and 1.970 L/h (1.326-2.499) and 20.169 L (12.857-32.629) for linezolid, respectively. Maximum a posteriori probability-Bayesian estimation plots of observed versus predicted had a slope of 0.999 r20.967 for minocycline, slope 0.998 r20.769 for rifampicin and slope 0.998 r20.895 for linezolid. PK/PD indices were not related to clinical outcome. Taking a translational minocycline fAUC24h/MIC target of >0.5 for minocycline in the presence of rifampicin, 96% (49/51) of patients reached the target. Population PK models of minocycline, rifampicin and linezolid were developed in patients with MRSA cSSTI and almost all patients reached the predefined PD index targets. As a result, neither AUC, MIC nor the AUC/MIC ratio could be related to clinical outcome.","2024","The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy"

Innovation in computer-aided drug design is primarily driven by structure- and ligand-based approaches. When the number of known inhibitors for a target is limited, data augmentation strategies are often preferred to enhance model performance. In this study, we developed predictive machine learning models for structure-based drug discovery leveraging multiple traditional machine learning algorithms trained with target and ligand dynamics-aware datasets. To illustrate our approach, we present a composite model that combines classification and regression to predict YTHDF1 inhibitors, utilizing PLEC features. YTHDF1, a key m6A reader protein involved in mRNA translation, is implicated in various cancers, making it a promising therapeutic target. Traditional structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) using generic scoring functions has struggled to identify potent YTHDF1 inhibitors due to the protein's unique binding characteristics. To overcome this, we developed YTHDF1-specific machine learning scoring functions (MLSFs) to enhance SBVS efficacy. We employed various data augmentation techniques to generate a comprehensive dataset, incorporating multiple conformations of ligands and the YTHDF1 protein. We have trained 64 YTHDF1-specific MLSFs using four machine learning algorithms and evaluated them on ten test sets, focusing on their predictive and ranking power. Our results demonstrate that the artificial neural network with protein-ligand extended connectivity fingerprints (ANN-PLEC) outperforms other MLSFs, consistently achieving high area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC) of 0.87. This method shows promise for targets with limited quantities of active molecules, providing a viable path forward for drug discovery research. The ANN-PLEC scoring function is made freely available on GitHub for other researchers to access and utilize https://github.com/JuniML/SBVS-YTHDF1/.","2024","Computers in biology and medicine"

The epidemiological evidence for association between sleep duration, depression and breast cancer is inconsistent. The aim of this study was to determine the association between them and build machine-learning algorithms to predict breast cancer. A total of 1,789 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) were included in the study, and 263 breast cancer patients were identified. Sleep duration was collected using a standardized questionnaire, and the Nine-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) was used to assess depression. Logistic regression yielded multivariable-adjusted breast cancer odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for sleep duration and depression. Then, six machine learning algorithms, including AdaBoost, random forest, Boost tree, artificial neural network, limit gradient enhancement and support vector machine, were used to predict the development of breast cancer and find out the best algorithm. Body mass index (BMI), race and smoking were statistically different between breast cancer and non-breast cancer groups. Participants with depression were associated with breast cancer (OR = 1.99, 95%CI: 1.55-3.51). Compared with 7-9h of sleep, the ORs for <7 and >9 h of sleep were 1.25 (95% CI: 0.85-1.37) and 1.05 (95% CI: 0.95-1.15), respectively. The AdaBoost model outperformed other machine learning algorithms and predicted well for breast cancer, with an area under curve (AUC) of 0.84 (95%CI: 0.81-0.87). No significant association was observed between sleep duration and breast cancer, and participants with depression were associated with an increased risk for breast cancer. This finding provides new clues into the relationship between breast cancer and depression and sleep duration, and provides potential evidence for subsequent studies of pathological mechanisms.","2024","Annals of medicine"

117,"39644711","Share-the-load vs bring-your-own-judge: The effects of friends on social evaluative stress in early adolescence.","Parental attachment figures effectively buffer their children's cortisol responses to a socially evaluative stressor, the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST), by providing instrumental and emotional support during the preparation period. The effectiveness of parents as stress buffers wanes in adolescence as youth increase their reliance on peers for support. Yet, in a previous study, when peers played the same supportive role as parents, the cortisol response to the TSST was amplified. Here we asked if the role the friend plays matters. We hypothesized that the support of a friend would reduce the cortisol response to the TSST if they were also undergoing the stressor; while friend support would increase the cortisol response if they were only there for support and were not also undergoing the stressor. 235 youth ages 11.2-15.1 years were tested in the TSST-OL, an on-line version of the TSST task. Saliva samples were obtained for cortisol determination at multiple timepoints. In this pre-registered study, youth were randomly assigned, stratified by age, sex assigned at birth and pubertal status (early/later), to one of the following conditions: 1) Alone, 2) Unfamiliar Peer - Both Tested, 3) Friend as Supporter, 4) Friend - Both Tested. Area under the curve from intercept (AUCi) for the initial reactivity phase was significantly different by group, matching our pre-registered prediction that friend support would reduce reactivity if both friends were undergoing the stressor, but increase it if the friend providing support did not also undergo the stressor. Recovery did not differ by condition. The effect of friends as stress buffers varies by the role the friend plays. In the case of the TSST, a social evaluative stressor, support from a friend buffers cortisol reactivity if the friend is also experiencing the stressor; but increases cortisol reactivity if they are just there as a support. Simply being with a supportive friend does not shield the adolescent from reacting with a neuroendocrine stress response to the stress of social evaluation.","2025","Psychoneuroendocrinology"

To explore the value of a nomogram constructed based on a CT plain scan and enhanced imaging features combined with clinical indicators in predicting brain metastasis of hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE). The imaging characteristics and clinical indicators of 116 patients diagnosed with HAE in the Affiliated Hospital of Qinghai University from 2015 to 2022 were retrospectively collected. The data were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set according to 7:3, and the difference between the two groups was analyzed. Binary logistic regression analysis was used to obtain independent predictors of brain metastasis in HAE, and a prediction model was constructed based on this and expressed in the form of a nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curve (CRC) were used to evaluate model performance, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to assess the clinical value of the predictive model. A total of 116 HAE patients were included (average age 38.07±15.09 years old, 54 males and 62 females, 81 patients (70 %) in the training set, and 35 patients (30 %) in the validation set). There was no statistically significant difference between CT plain scan and enhanced imaging features combined with clinical indicators between the training set and the validation set (p > 0.05). After statistical analysis, it was found that whether there is invasion of the inferior vena cava, whether there is invasion of the hepatic artery, and whether there is metastasis to other organs are independent predictors of brain metastasis in HAE. A prediction model was built based on these three variables. The area under the ROC curve (AUC), cutoff value, sensitivity, and specificity of the training set and validation set were 0.922 and 0.886, 0.6934 and 0.6643, 75.00 and 84.62, 94.34 and 81.82, respectively. CRC shows good consistency between the predicted probability and the actual value of the sample. DCA showed that the clinical value of the model was high. The nomogram constructed based on imaging features combined with clinical indicators can effectively predict whether HAE will develop brain metastasis, which is helpful for clinicians to quickly screen out high-risk patients with HAE developing brain metastases, evaluate patient prognosis, and is more conducive to the realization of individualized and precise medical decisions.","2024","Acta tropica"

The aims were to investigate changes in inflammatory status, myenteric neuron numbers/phenotype, neuromuscular functions and prokinetic drug efficacy. Macroscopically normal proximal-to-mid rectum was obtained from 21 patients undergoing surgery for bowel cancer, 98 days (range: 63-350) after concurrent capecitabine and pelvic radiotherapy, and 19 patients without chemoradiotherapy. Inflammatory status was measured by H&E, CD45 staining and qPCR. Myenteric neurons were examined by immunohistochemistry. Neuromuscular functions and drug efficacy were studied using exogenous agents and electrical field stimulation (EFS) to activate intrinsic nerves. Inflammation was not detected. Numbers of myenteric ganglia/neurons were unchanged (11.7 ± 2.4 vs. 10.3 ± 2.2 neurons/mm myenteric plexus with/without chemoradiotherapy) as were the numbers of cholinergic/nitrergic neurons. EFS stimulated cholinergic and nitrergic neurons so the contractile response of the muscle was the sum of both but dominated by cholinergic (causing contraction) or less often, nitrergic activity (relaxation), followed, after termination of EFS, by neuronally mediated contraction. Inhibition of nitric oxide synthase (by L-NAME 300 μM) more clearly defined EFS-evoked contractions. The 5-HT4 agonist prucalopride 10 μM and the cholinesterase inhibitor donepezil 1 µM, respectively increased and greatly increased the composite contractile response to EFS (measured as 'area-under-the curve') and the contractions isolated by L-NAME (respectively, by 22 ± 14% and 334 ± 87%; n = 11/8). After chemoradiotherapy, nitrergic-mediated muscle relaxations occurred more often during EFS (in 29.8 ± 6.1% preparations vs. 12.6 ± 5.1% without chemoradiotherapy, n = 21/18). With L-NAME, the ability of prucalopride to facilitate EFS-evoked contraction was lost and that of donepezil approximately halved (contractions increased by 132 ± 36%; n = 8). Several months after chemoradiotherapy, the rectum was not inflamed and myenteric neuron numbers/phenotype unchanged. However, nitrergic activity was increased relative to cholinergic activity, and prokinetic-like drug activity was lost or greatly reduced. Thus, chemoradiotherapy causes long-term changes in neuromuscular functions and markedly reduces the efficacy of drugs for treating constipation.","2024","United European gastroenterology journal"

This study aimed to explore the prognostic significance of the four nutritional indices, namely Prognostic Nutritional Index (PNI), Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT), and High-Sensitivity Modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (HS-mGPS), in evaluating the long-term prognosis in elderly patients with AF. This retrospective study was conducted at a single center and included a total of 261 elderly patients with AF from December 2015 to December 2021. Patients were divided into all-cause death and survival groups based on the follow-up results. Kaplan-Meier analysis and COX regression were conducted to explore the relationship between all-cause mortality and nutritional scores. In addition, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the predictive value of the four nutritional screening tools for the endpoint event. During the follow-up period, 119 cases (45.59%) of all-cause mortality were recorded. The cumulative incidence of all-cause death was significantly higher in participants with a lower PNI, lower GNRI, higher CONUT, and higher HS-mGPS levels. And the low PNI (HR 1.325, 95% CI 1.032-2.857, P=0.025) and the high HS-mGPS (HR 2.166, 95% CI 1.281-4.326, P=0.023) groups were independently and significantly associated with increased risk of all-cause death analyzed by multivariate COX regression. Additionally, PNI showed the best area under the curve value (AUC: 0.696, 95% CI 0.632-0.760 P < 0.001) for the prediction of all-cause mortality compared with the other nutritional indices.

A total of 102 patients diagnosed with locally advanced rectal cancer were divided into training (n = 71) and validation (n = 31) cohorts. The expression statuses of HIF-1α were histopathologically classified, categorizing patients into high and low expression groups. The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), minimum redundancy maximum relevance (mRMR), and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) were employed for feature selection to construct a radiomics signature and calculate the radiomics score (Rad-score). Univariate and multivariate analyses of clinical features and Rad-score were applied, and the clinical model and the nomogram were constructed. The predictive performance of the nomogram incorporating clinical features and Rad-score was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curves. Seven radiomics features from DCE-MRI were used to build the radiomics signature. The nomogram incorporating CEA, Ki-67 and Rad-score had the highest AUC values in the training cohort and in the validation cohort (AUC: 0.918 and 0.920). Decision curve analysis showed that the nomogram outperformed the clinical model and radiomics signature in terms of clinical utility. In addition, the calibration curve for the nomogram demonstrated good agreement between prediction and actual observation.

There is growing evidence suggesting that the recovery capacity of elderly SCI patients is poorer than that of young individuals. However, the specific molecular mechanisms remain unclear. RNA expression profiles of SCI samples were collected from the GEO database, and key genes involved in the progression of SCI were identified by the limma package in R software. A diagnostic model based on SCIDEG was constructed using LASSO regression analysis. Subsequently, correlation analysis was conducted to identify biological pathways influenced by the key genes. Furthermore, SCI animal models were established in different age groups to examine the expression of relevant genes and verify the molecular mechanism of p53/HIF-1α axis. We initially identified 34 ischemia-hypoxia-related genes potentially involved in the progression of SCI. Subsequently, we constructed a diagnostic model based on SCIDEGs using LASSO regression analysis. This model highlighted 9 key genes (TP53, SFTPA1, MASP2, KRT14, IL9, HIF1A, HGFAC, FUT7, and ALPP), which demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy in both the training set (AUC=1) and the validation set (AUC=0.855). Further cross-analysis with ischemia-reperfusion-related datasets confirmed the involvement of HIF1A and TP53. We also observed significant enrichment of HIF1A in organoids composed of mature neurons, which induced neuronal damage. In subsequent spinal cord injury animal models of different age groups, we found that HIF-1α expression was downregulated in the spinal cord tissues of elderly animals. Additionally, we discovered that TP53 activation induces cellular senescence in aging neurons and suppresses HIF-1α expression and autophagy levels within these cells. In summary, our study suggests that the p53/HIF-1α signaling pathway plays a critical role in regulating neuronal aging and autophagy in the pathogenesis of SCI. Importantly, HIF-1α may represent a promising therapeutic target for SCI treatment.","2024","Mechanisms of ageing and development"

Among the 798 patients, 638 were males and 160 were females, with the average age of 43.51 years old and the mean body mass index (BMI) of 25.92 kg/m2. The sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, F1 score and the area under receiver operating characteristic curve for RF model and Logistic regression model were 94.68% vs. 73.94%; 73.08% vs. 86.54%; 90.00% vs. 76.67%; 0.94 vs. 0.83 and 0.83 vs. 0.80 respectively. The RF prediction model can effectively distinguish patients with moderate to severe OSA, which is expected to carry out in a large-scale population in order to screening for high-risk patients, and helps to evaluate the effect of OSA treatment continuously.","2024","Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung"

While reduction mammaplasty is often the best treatment, risk factors for adolescent wound complications remain unclear. This study aims to investigate the impact of obesity and other predictors of postoperative wound complications following adolescent reduction mammaplasty using a national database. The 2012-2019 National Surgical Quality Improvement Program Pediatric (NSQIP-P) databases were reviewed to identify primary reduction mammaplasty encounters. World Health Organization Body Mass Index (BMI), alongside patient and case characteristics, were assessed for association for 30-day wound disruption or surgical site complications. Statistical analyses were performed to identify independent predictors for complications and determine a potential BMI cutoff for risk stratification. There were 1215 patients with an average age of 16.6 years. The average BMI was 30.7 kg/m2, and 593 (48.8%) patients were nonobese while 622 (51.2%) were obese. The incidence of complications was 5.27%. Independent predictors of complications included a BMI 35-39.9, BMI  > 40, and an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Classification  > 3. A receiver operating characteristic curve determined that a BMI of 34.6 can be a potential cutoff for increased complication risk. Higher obesity increases risk of wound complications; however, complication rates remain low. A BMI of 34.6 is a potential screening metric for counseling and monitoring patients. Reduction mammaplasty should remain a viable option as it can significantly improve quality of life. This journal requires that authors assign a level of evidence to each article.

However, they frequently experience neurological deterioration during hospitalization. This study aimed to investigate the association between neurological deterioration and hemodynamic impairment by assessing steal phenomenon derived from blood oxygenation-level dependent cerebrovascular reactivity (BOLD-CVR) in this specific patient cohort. From the database of our single-center BOLD-CVR observational cohort study (June 2015-October 2023) we retrospectively identified acute ischemic stroke patients with admission NIHSS < 6, a newly detected large vessel occlusion of the anterior circulation and ineligible for EVT. Neurological deterioration during hospitalization as well as outcome at hospital discharge were rated with NIHSS score. We analyzed the association between these two outcomes and BOLD-CVR-derived steal phenomenon volume through regression analysis. Additionally, we investigated the discriminatory accuracy of steal phenomenon volume for predicting neurological deterioration. Forty patients were included in the final analysis. Neurological deterioration occurred in 35% of patients. In the regression analysis, a strong association between steal phenomenon volume and neurological deterioration (OR 4.80, 95% CI 1.32-31.04, p = 0.04) as well as poorer NIHSS score at hospital discharge (OR 3.73, 95% CI 1.52-10.78, p = 0.007) was found. The discriminatory accuracy of steal phenomenon for neurological deterioration prediction had an AUC of 0.791 (95% CI 0.653-0.930). Based on our results we may distinguish two groups of patients with minor stroke currently ineligible for EVT, however, showing hemodynamic impairment and exhibiting neurological deterioration during hospitalization: (1) patients exhibiting steal phenomenon on BOLD-CVR imaging as well as hemodynamic impairment on resting perfusion imaging; (2) patients exhibiting steal phenomenon on BOLD-CVR imaging, however, no relevant hemodynamic impairment on resting perfusion imaging. The presence of BOLD-CVR derived steal phenomenon may aid to further study hemodynamic impairment in patients with minor LVO-AIS not eligible for EVT.","2024","European stroke journal"

Multivariable analysis was used to identify the independent predictors for MVI and RFS. Nomograms were constructed for visualization. Models for predicting MVI and RFS were built using mp-MRI parameters and a combination of mp-MRI and 3D MRE predictors. Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared or Fisher's exact tests, multivariable analysis, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), DeLong test, Kaplan-Meier analysis and log rank tests. P < 0.05 was considered significant. Tumor c and liver c were independent predictors of MVI and RFS, respectively. Adding tumor c significantly improved the diagnostic performance of mp-MRI (AUC increased from 0.70 to 0.87) for MVI detection. Of the 106 patients in the training cohort who completed the 2-year follow up, 34 experienced recurrence. RFS was shorter for patients with MVI-positive histology than MVI-negative histology (27.1 months vs. >40 months).

Combined with the steady-state somatosensory evoked potential (MI-SSSEP), this new paradigm can achieve higher recognition accuracy than the traditional MI paradigm. Typical algorithms do not fully consider the characteristics of MI-SSSEP signals. Developing an algorithm that fully captures the paradigm's characteristics to reduce false triggering rate is the new step in improving performance. The idea to use complex signal task-related component analysis (cTRCA) algorithm for spatial filtering processing has been proposed in this paper according to the features of SSSEP signal. In this research, it's proved from the analysis of simulation signals that task-related component analysis (TRCA) as typical method is affected when the response between stimuli has reduced correlation and the proposed algorithm can effectively overcome this problem. The experimental data under the MI-SSSEP paradigm have been used to identify right-handed target tasks and three unique interference tasks are used to test the false triggering rate. cTRCA demonstrates superior performance as confirmed by the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The recognition algorithm of cTRCA combined with mutual information-based best individual feature (MIBIF) and minimum distance to mean (MDM) can obtain AUC value up to 0.89, which is much higher than traditional algorithm common spatial pattern (CSP) combined with support vector machine (SVM) (the average AUC value is 0.77, p < 0.05). Compared to CSP+SVM, this algorithm model reduced the false triggering rate from 38.69 % to 20.74 % (p < 0.001). The research prove that TRCA is influenced by MI-SSSEP signals. The results further prove that the motor imagery task in the new paradigm MI-SSSEP causes the phase change in evoked potential. and the cTRCA algorithm based on such phase change is more suitable for this hybrid paradigm and more conducive to decoding the motor imagery task and reducing false triggering rate.","2024","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

However, it often includes tumor morphology, which is usually assessed with imaging studies or pathologic analysis, leading to limited predictive performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a simple and low-cost prognostic score for HCC based on serum biomarkers in routine clinical practice. A total of 3,100 patients were recruited. The least absolute shrinkage and selector operation (LASSO) algorithm was used to select the significant factors for overall survival. The prognostic score was devised based on multivariate Cox regression of the training cohort. Model performance was assessed by discrimination and calibration. Albumin (ALB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were selected by the LASSO algorithm. The three variables were incorporated into multivariate Cox regression to create the risk score (APP score = 0.390* ln (ALP) + 0.063* ln(AFP) - 0.033*ALB). The C-index, K-index, and time-dependent AUC of the score displayed significantly better predictive performance than 5 other models and 5 other staging systems. The model was able to stratify patients into three different risk groups. In conclusion, the APP score was developed to estimate survival probability and was used to stratify three strata with significantly different outcomes, outperforming other models in training and validation cohorts as well as different subgroups. This simple and low-cost model could help guide individualized follow-up.","2025","Bioscience trends"

The link between VAI and diabetes was evaluated using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression models. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the predictive value of the VAI for incident diabetes. Our study included 15,452 participants, with 8,418 men (54.48%) and 7,034 women (45.52%). The average age was 43.71 ± 8.90, and 373 participants (2.41%) developed diabetes. VAI was positively related to diabetes (HR=1.13, 95% CI 1.08-1.18). The inflection point of the non-linear relationship was observed at a VAI value of 4.67. For the VAI values up to 4.67, one unit increase in the VAI related to a 24% increase in new-onset diabetes (HR=1.24, 95% CI 1.12-1.37, p<0.0001). Subgroup analysis detected a more robust relationship in women (HR=1.40, 95% CI 1.14-1.70, p=0.0010). ROC analysis indicated that VAI, with an AUC of 0.7479 (95% CI: 0.7237-0.7720), had good predictive power. Our cohort study validated the positive and non-linear relationship between the VAI and diabetes in normoglycemic adults in Japan. The relevance was more marked in women than in men. For those with a VAI below 4.67, a further reduction in the VAI could potentially lead to a significant decrease in diabetes risk.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

Ribosomal Protein Lateral Stalk Subunit P0 (RPLP0) is implicated in numerous tumor progression processes. Nevertheless, the regulatory mechanism of RPLP0 in HCC progression remains unclear. Our study suggested that RPLP0 exhibits high expression levels in HCC and possesses promising diagnostic capabilities, as indicated by its area under the curve (AUC) of 0.908. Further analysis showed that RPLP0 was a significant independent prognostic factor, and elevated expression levels of RPLP0 were linked with poorer overall survival (OS) and progression-free interval (PFI) outcomes. Additionally, reducing RPLP0 levels led to a decrease in HCC cell proliferation, clonality, invasion, migration, and xenograft tumor growth, as well as an increase in apoptosis. Furthermore, our findings indicated that microRNA(miR)-450b-5p induced downregulation of RPLP0, leading to the suppression of the JAK/STAT3 pathway and consequently hindering the advancement of HCC. The study indicates that RPLP0 plays a role as a carcinogenic factor in HCC and carries important diagnostic and prognostic implications.

Fecal specimens were obtained from 16 healthy controls, 33 patients with viral-HCC (17 and 16 cases with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, respectively), and 18 patients with NBNC-HCC. Compositions of fecal microbiota were assessed by 16S rRNA sequencing. Bioinformatic analysis was performed by the DADA2 pipeline in the R program. Significantly different genera from the top 50 relative abundance were used to classify between subgroups of HCC by the Random Forest algorithm. Our data demonstrated that the HCC group had a significantly decreased alpha-diversity and changed microbial composition in comparison with healthy controls. Within the top 50 relative abundance, there were 11 genera including Faecalibacterium, Agathobacter, and Coprococcus that were significantly enhanced in Viral-HCC, while 5 genera such as Bacteroides, Streptococcus, Ruminococcus gnavus group, Parabacteroides, and Erysipelatoclostridium were enhanced in NBNC-HCC. Compared to Viral-HCC, the NBNC-HCC subgroup significantly reduced various short-chain fatty acid-producing bacteria, as well as declined fecal butyrate but elevated plasma surrogate markers of microbial translocation. Based on the machine learning algorithm, a high diagnostic accuracy to classify HCC subgroups was achieved with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.94. Collectively, these data revealed that gut dysbiosis was distinct according to etiological factors of HCC, which might play an essential role in hepatocarcinogenesis. These findings underscore the possible use of a gut microbiota signature for the diagnosis and therapeutic approaches regarding different subgroups of HCC.

We investigated five locoregional tumor metabolites in a post-treatment population and applied machine learning (ML) techniques to analyze key relationships within seven regions of interest: contralateral normal-appearing white matter (NAWM), fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR), contrast-enhancing tumor at time of WB-MRS (Tumor), areas of future recurrence (AFR), whole-brain healthy (WBH), non-progressive FLAIR (NPF), and progressive FLAIR (PF). Five supervised ML classification models and a neural network were developed, optimized, trained, tested, and validated. Lastly, a web application was developed to host our novel calculator, the Miami Glioma Prediction Map (MGPM), for open-source interaction. Sixteen patients with histopathological confirmation of high-grade glioma prior to WB-MRS were included in this study, totaling 118,922 whole-brain voxels. ML models successfully differentiated normal-appearing white matter from tumor and future progression. Notably, the highest performing ML model predicted glioma progression within fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) signal in the post-treatment setting (mean AUC = 0.86), with Cho/Cr as the most important feature. This study marks a significant milestone as the first of its kind to unveil radiographic occult glioma progression in post-treatment gliomas within 8 months of discovery. These findings underscore the utility of ML-based WB-MRS growth predictions, presenting a promising avenue for the guidance of early treatment decision-making. This research represents a crucial advancement in predicting the timing and location of glioblastoma recurrence, which can inform treatment decisions to improve patient outcomes.","2024","Journal of neuro-oncology"

Dynamic brain activity indicators can reflect changes in key neural activity patterns of cognition and behavior. To investigate dynamic functional connectivity (DFC) changes and spontaneous brain activity based on resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) in patients with T2D, exploring their correlations with clinical features. Retrospective. Forty-five healthy controls (HCs) (22 males and 23 females) and 102 patients with T2D (57 males and 45 females). 3.0 T/T1-weighted imaging and rs-fMRI with gradient-echo planar imaging sequence. Functional networks were created using independent component analysis. DFC states were determined using sliding window approach and k-means clustering. Spontaneous brain activity was assessed using dynamic regional homogeneity (dReHo) variability. One-way analysis of variance and post hoc analysis were used to compare the essential information including demographics, clinical data, and features of DFC and dReHo among groups. Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. P-values <0.05 were taken to indicate statistical significance. T2D group had significantly decreased mean dwell time and fractional windows in state 4 compared to HC. T2D with mild cognitive impairment showed significantly increased dReHo variability in left superior occipital gyrus compared to T2D with normal cognition. Mean dwell time and number of fractional windows of state 4 both showed significant positive correlations with the Montreal cognitive assessment scores (r = 0.309; r = 0.308, respectively) and the coefficient of variation of dReHo was significantly positively correlated with high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (r = 0.266). The integrated index had an area under the curve of 0.693 (95% confidence interval = 0.592-0.794). Differences in DFC and dynamic characteristic of spontaneous brain activity associated with T2D-related functional impairment may serve as indicators for predicting symptom progression and assessing cognitive dysfunction. 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.","2024","Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI"

However, the reliance on extensive multicenter datasets for training AI models poses challenges due to privacy concerns. Federated learning provides a solution by facilitating collaborative model training across multiple centers without sharing raw data. This study introduces a federated attention-consistent learning (FACL) framework to address challenges associated with large-scale pathological images and data heterogeneity. FACL enhances model generalization by maximizing attention consistency between local clients and the server model. To ensure privacy and validate robustness, we incorporated differential privacy by introducing noise during parameter transfer. We assessed the effectiveness of FACL in cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading tasks using 19,461 whole-slide images of prostate cancer from multiple centers. In the diagnosis task, FACL achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9718, outperforming seven centers with an average AUC of 0.9499 when categories are relatively balanced. For the Gleason grading task, FACL attained a Kappa score of 0.8463, surpassing the average Kappa score of 0.7379 from six centers. In conclusion, FACL offers a robust, accurate, and cost-effective AI training model for prostate cancer pathology while maintaining effective data safeguards.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

This study aims to meet the urgent need for reliable predictive tools by developing an optimized machine learning model to estimate the risk of URO following anterior resection in rectal cancer patients. This retrospective study collected multidimensional data from patients who underwent anterior resection for rectal cancer at Tongji Hospital of Huazhong University of Science and Technology from January 2012 to December 2022. Feature selection was conducted using both least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and the Boruta algorithm. Multiple machine learning models were developed, with parameter optimization via grid search and cross-validation. Performance metrics included accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, and area under curve (AUC). The optimal model was interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), and an online platform was created for real-time risk prediction. A total of 2384 patients who underwent anterior resection for rectal cancer were included in this study. Following rigorous selection, 14 variables were identified for constructing the machine learning model. The optimized model demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with the random forest (RF) model achieving the best overall performance. The model achieved an AUC of 0.889 and an accuracy of 0.842 on the test dataset. SHAP analysis revealed that the tumor location, previous abdominal surgery, and operative time were the most significant factors influencing the risk of URO. This study developed an optimized machine learning-based online predictive system to assess the risk of URO after anterior resection in rectal cancer patients.

148,"39143000","Immature platelet fraction levels predict the development of prolonged thrombocytopenia after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","Prolonged thrombocytopenia (PT) is a serious complication after haematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). PT has been suggested to be associated with an increased platelet transfusion requirement and poor outcomes after transplantation. Due to the complex mechanism of PT development, it is difficult to diagnose in the early post-transplant period. Our study aimed to identify an early predictive marker for PT after HSCT. Previous studies showed that the clinical utility of immature platelet fraction (IPF) predicts platelet recovery after chemotherapy and successful engraftment. However, the relationship between IPF and PT after HSCT remains unclear. Fifty-two patients with malignant haematological diseases who underwent HSCT were included in the study. We observed the kinetics of recovery of haematological parameters after transplantation and performed receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis using data from the 52 HSCT patients. The days to rise and peak of IPF, absolute IPF count (A-IPF) and highly fluorescent IPF (H-IPF) were almost synchronised in all patients, at day 10 and day 15, respectively. The begin to rise levels of IPF, H-IPF and A-IPF were all significantly lower in the PT group than in the good engraftment (GE) group (p=0.0016, p=0.0094, p=0.0086, respectively). The peak levels of IPF were significantly lower in the PT group than the GE group (p=0.0036). However, the peaks of H-IPF and A-IPF were not statistically significant between the two groups (p=0.3383, p=0.0887, respectively). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of IPF rise was 0.739 (95% CI 0.583-0.896; p<0.05) and the cut-off value was 3.5%, while the AUC of IPF peak was 0.800 (95% CI 0.637-0.962; p<0.01) and the cut-off value was 8.0%. In conclusion, early low levels of IPF predict the development of PT after HSCT. These findings may help improve the management and treatment strategies for PT after HSCT.","2024","Pathology"

Given the high prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among women experiencing IPV, it is necessary to consider whether PTSD assessments function adequately for this population. Thus, the present study aimed to evaluate the psychometric properties of the past-month version of the PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), one of the most widely used self-report measures of PTSD symptoms, in a sample of community women experiencing IPV. Participants were 158 women who had experienced IPV in the past 6 months (Mage = 40.14 years, 39.9% White). The PCL-5 demonstrated good internal consistency, Cronbach's α = .97, and scores were significantly positively correlated with theoretically related constructs (i.e., PTSD symptom count on the SCID-5, IPV severity, substance use, depression, anxiety, and emotion dysregulation); however, it demonstrated poor 30-day stability, r = .38, ICC = .55. The ability of the PCL-5 to discriminate with respect to a PTSD diagnosis was acceptable, AUC = .74. A cutoff score of 21 maximized sensitivity (82.5%) and specificity (55.4%); this is lower than typical cutoffs (i.e., 31-33). Although the PCL-5 has generally demonstrated adequate psychometric properties, findings suggest that it does not function optimally for women experiencing IPV relative to its functioning for other trauma-exposed populations. The lower-than-typical cutoff suggests that the PCL-5 may underestimate PTSD prevalence among women experiencing IPV.","2024","Journal of traumatic stress"
150,"39395242","Prediction and validation of pathologic complete response for locally advanced rectal cancer under neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy based on a novel predictor using interpretable machine learning.","Precise evaluation of pathological complete response (pCR) is essential for determining the prognosis of patients with locally advanced rectal cancer (LARC) undergoing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy (NCRT) and can offer clues for the selection of subsequent treatment strategies. Most current predictive models for pCR focus primarily on pre-treatment factors, neglecting the dynamic systemic changes that occur during neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, and are constrained by low accuracy and lack of integrity. This study devised a novel predictor of pCR using dynamic alterations in systemic inflammation-nutritional marker indexes (SINI) during neoadjuvant therapy and developed a machine-learning model to predict pCR. Two cohorts of patients with LARC from center one from 2012 to 2017 and from center two from 2020 to 2023 were integrated for analysis. This study compared dynamic changes in blood indexes before and after neoadjuvant therapy and surgical operation. A least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was conducted to mitigate collinearity and identify key indexes, constructing the SINI. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses were used to identify the independent risk factors associated with pCR. Additionally, 10 machine learning algorithms were employed to develop predictive models to assess risk. The hyperparameters of the machine learning models were optimized using a random search and 10-fold cross-validation. The models were assessed by examining various metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC), decision curve analysis, calibration curves, and the precision and accuracy of the internal and external validation cohorts. Additionally, Shapley's additive explanations (SHAP) were employed to interpret the machine learning models. The study cohort comprised 677 patients from the center one and 224 patients from the center two. Six key indexes were identified, and a predictive index, SINI, was constructed. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analyses revealed that SINI, clinical T-stage, clinical N-stage, tumor size, and the distance from the anal verge were independent risk factors for pCR in patients with LARC following NCRT. The mean AUC value of the extreme gradient boosting (XGB) model in the 10-fold cross-validation of the training set was 0.877. The XGB model demonstrated superior performance in the internal and external validation sets. Specifically, in the internal test set, the XGB model achieved an AUC of 0.86, AUPRC of 0.707, accuracy of 0.82, and precision of 0.80. In the external validation set, the XGB model exhibited an AUC of 0.83, AUPRC of 0.702, accuracy of 0.81, and precision of 0.81. Additionally, the predictions generated by the XGB model were analyzed using SHAP. This study involved developing and validating an XGB model using SINI to predict pCR in patients with LARC. Besides, a SINI-based machine learning model shows promise in accurately predicting pCR following NCRT in patients with resectable LARC, offering valuable insights for personalized treatment approaches.","2024","European journal of surgical oncology : the journal of the European Society of Surgical Oncology and the British Association of Surgical Oncology"

The D-loop region of mtDNA has emerged as a variation hotspot region in human neoplasia; however, the potential contribution of these variations in breast cancer risk prediction remains unknown. We investigated the relationship between germline single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the entire D-loop region and breast cancer risk in Chinese women. Peripheral blood-isolated mtDNA from 2329 patients with breast cancer and 2328 cancer-free controls was examined for SNPs. In the combined cohort, we used traditional risk factors, susceptibility germline polymorphisms, and logistic regression analysis to evaluate the predictive value of susceptibility variants for breast cancer risk. We calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) as a measure. We also measured the content of 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG). Individual polymorphisms SNP573 were significantly associated with breast cancer risk in both the discovery and validation cohorts. In the combined cohort, the AUC of the traditional risk factors was 64.3%; after adding susceptibility variants, the AUC was 64.9% (DeLong test, p = 0.007). 8-OHdG levels were significantly higher in patients with breast cancer than in controls and higher in individuals with SNP573 than in those negative for this variation. Overall, oxidative stress might be associated with the risk of breast cancer, and SNP573 might be associated with oxidative stress. Our results indicate the risk potential of polymorphisms in the D-loop region in breast cancer in Southern China.","2024","Cancer science"

This is a retrospective study of comatose patients with TBI who were admitted to a trauma center (October 2013 to January 2022). Demographics, basic clinical data, imaging characteristics, and EEGs were collected. We calculated the following using 10-min rsEEGs: power spectral density, permutation entropy (complexity measure), weighted symbolic mutual information (wSMI, global information sharing measure), Kolmogorov complexity (Kolcom, complexity measure), and heart-evoked potentials (the averaged EEG signal relative to the corresponding QRS complex on electrocardiography). We evaluated the prediction of consciousness recovery before hospital discharge using clinical, imaging, and rsEEG data via a support vector machine. We studied 113 of 134 (84%) patients with rsEEGs. A total of 73 (65%) patients recovered consciousness before discharge. Patients who recovered consciousness were younger (40 vs. 50 years, p = 0.01). Patients who recovered also had higher Kolcom (U = 1688, p = 0.01), increased beta power (U = 1,652 p = 0.003) with higher variability across channels (U = 1534, p = 0.034) and epochs (U = 1711, p = 0.004), lower delta power (U = 981, p = 0.04), and higher connectivity across time and channels as measured by wSMI in the theta band (U = 1636, p = 0.026; U = 1639, p = 0.024) than those who did not recover. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for rsEEG was higher than that for clinical data (using age, motor response, pupil reactivity) and higher than that for the Marshall computed tomography classification (0.69 vs. 0.66 vs. 0.56, respectively; p < 0.001). We describe the rsEEG signature in recovery of consciousness prior to discharge in comatose patients with TBI. rsEEG measures performed modestly better than the clinical and imaging data in predicting recovery.","2024","Neurocritical care"

Of the 54 patients, 43 had Wilms tumor (WT), 4 had clear cell sarcoma of the kidney (CCSK), 3 had rhabdoid tumor of kidney, 2 had renal cell carcinoma, and 2 had congenital mesoblastic nephroma. 18F-FDG PET/CT detected all primary renal tumors, with SUVmax ranging from 1.2 to 14.5. PET-derived parameters showed no significant differences among different tumor types, except for CCSK, which exhibited lower FDG uptake compared to WT (SUVmax 3.60 ± 1.02 vs. 6.10 ± 2.25, p = 0.034). Higher MTV, TLG, and lactate dehydrogenase were associated with stage IV disease. ROC analysis showed that TLG had the highest AUC (0.931) for predicting stage IV disease in the whole cohort, while SUVmax had the highest AUC (0.867) for predicting stage IV and V in WT. Furthermore, Children with 1q gain exhibited higher MTV in WT (447 ± 354 vs. 207 ± 189, p = 0.041).

There is a need for alternative approaches to enable rapid and early diagnosis of UC. In this study, we propose TE-RPA, which combines telomerase extension (TE) with recombinase polymerase amplification (RPA) for one-tube isothermal amplification. The GC content and length of the telomerase substrate were first considered during the screening process. TE-RPA exponential amplification was initiated by the addition of MgOAc along with a forward primer derived from the products of telomerase-mediated extension and a corresponding reverse primer. The amplification product from TE-RPA was subsequently detected using CRISPR-Cas12a system for trans-cleavage of signal probes on the surface of screen-printed electrode in an electrochemical biosensor, resulting in a current change that reflects the corresponding concentration of telomerase. The TE-RPA/CRISPR-Cas12a/electrochemical sensing platform achieves a limit of detection (LOD) for telomerase activity as low as a single-cell level. In addition, the platform attained an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.9589 in a clinical evaluation involving urine samples from 43 suspected UC patients.

ALI was calculated as body-mass index (BMI)∗albumin/neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio; patients were categorized into ""low-"" and ""high-ALI"" using log-rank statistics. The impact of ALI on OS was compared against other inflammatory markers (i.e., neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio [NLR], platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio [PLR], systemic immune inflammation index [SII = platelets∗NLR]) using Harrell's Concordance index (C-index) and the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). To minimize intergroup differences, propensity score matching was employed. Among 1045 patients, more than one-half of individuals underwent major hepatectomy (n = 582, 55.7 %), median tumor size was 5.5 cm (IQR, 3.8-7.8), and median ALI was 38.9 (IQR 26.5-57.2). On multivariate analysis, low ALI was an independent risk factor for worse OS (HR 1.21, 95 % CI 1.01-1.46; p = 0.04). Patients with low ALI had worse 5-year OS (36.9 % vs. 49.9 %; p < 0.001), which remained significant after PSM (36.9 % vs. 41.3 %; p = 0.039).

Its pooled DOR was 6.89 (95% CI: 5.03-9.43), and AUC was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.75-0.82). The pooled sensitivity and specificity of AGR for the diagnosis of PJI were 0.80 (95% CI: 0.70-0.88) and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.79-0.87), respectively. Its DOR was 17.69 (95% CI: 10.76-29.07), and AUC was 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85-0.91). NLR and AGR can be individually used as reliable serum biomarkers for the detection of PJI. Future research is warranted to determine the diagnostic value of these markers in combination with C-reactive protein levels and erythrocyte sedimentation rates to improve diagnostic accuracy for PJI in clinical practice.","2024","EFORT open reviews"
161,"39321562","Knowledge graph confidence-aware embedding for recommendation.","Knowledge graphs (KG) are vital for extracting and storing knowledge from large datasets. Current research favors knowledge graph-based recommendation methods, but they often overlook the features learning of relations between entities and focus excessively on entity-level details. Moreover, they ignore a crucial fact: the aggregation process of entity and relation features in KG is complex, diverse, and imbalanced. To address this, we propose a recommendation-oriented KG confidence-aware embedding technique. It introduces an information aggregation graph and a confidence feature aggregation mechanism to overcome these challenges. Additionally, we quantify entity confidence at the feature and category levels, improving the precision of embeddings during information propagation and aggregation. Our approach achieves significant improvements over state-of-the-art KG embedding-based recommendation methods, with up to 6.20% increase in AUC and 8.46% increase in GAUC, as demonstrated on four public KG datasets2.","2024","Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society"

Thus kappa free light chains (KFLC) have emerged as a quantitative alternative. However, the cut-off values for KFLC have not been well established yet and it is not clear if differences between sexes exist. We aim to evaluate these and to compare the diagnostic accuracy of KFLC concentrations and their related indexes versus OCB. For that purpose, paired CSF and serum samples were collected and immediately processed for albumin, total protein, immunoglobulins and OCB, then frozen at -20°C. KFLC was measured in a BN II (Siemens Healthineers, Germany). KFLC-derived indexes were calculated. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC), Youden's index and odds ratio. From the 193 patients included, 56 were classified as MS according to the 2017 McDonald criteria. K-index, Q KFLC and Reiber's diagram showed good accuracy in MS diagnosis when studied distinguishing between sexes, similar to OCB. Cut-offs for K-index and Q KFLC change substantially between sex having the highest AUC similar than OCB. A sex-dependent algorithm combining the use of K-index, Q KFLC and OCB yields the highest diagnostic accuracy. In conclusion, CSF KFLC measurement is a rapid, quantitative and easy-to-standardize tool that used through the proposed sex-dependent algorithm may reduce the number of manual OCB tests performed.","2024","Scandinavian journal of immunology"

Predicting the treatment response to anti-VEGF monotherapy in PCV is consistently challenging. We aimed to conduct a prospective multicenter study to explore and identify the imaging biomarkers for predicting the anti-VEGF treatment response in PCV patients, establish predictive model, and undergo multicenter validation. This prospective multicenter study utilized clinical characteristics and images of treatment naïve PCV patients from 15 ophthalmic centers nationwide to screen biomarkers, develop model, and validate its performance. Patients from Peking Union Medical College Hospital were randomly divided into a training set and an internal validation set. A nomogram was established by univariate, LASSO regression, and multivariate regression analysis. Patients from the other 14 centers served as an external test set. Area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were calculated. Decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curve (CIC) were utilized to evaluate the practical utility in clinical decision-making. The eye distribution for the training set, internal validation set, and external test set were 66, 31, and 71, respectively. The 'Good responder' exhibited a thinner subfoveal choroidal thickness (SFCT) (230.67 ± 61.96 vs. 314.42 ± 88.00 μm, p < 0.001), lower choroidal vascularity index (CVI) (0.31 ± 0.08 vs. 0.36 ± 0.05, p = 0.006), fewer choroidal vascular hyperpermeability (CVH) (31.0 vs. 62.2%, p = 0.012), and more intraretinal fluid (IRF) (58.6 vs. 29.7%, p = 0.018). SFCT (OR 0.990; 95% CI 0.981-0.999; p = 0.033) and CVI (OR 0.844; 95% CI 0.732-0.971; p = 0.018) were ultimately included as the optimal predictive biomarkers and presented in the form of a nomogram. The model demonstrated AUC of 0.837 (95% CI 0.738-0.936), 0.891 (95% CI 0.765-1.000), and 0.901 (95% CI 0.824-0.978) for predicting 'Good responder' in the training set, internal validation set, and external test set, respectively, with excellent sensitivity, specificity, and practical utility. Thinner SFCT and lower CVI can serve as imaging biomarkers for predicting good treatment response to anti-VEGF monotherapy in PCV patients. The nomogram based on these biomarkers exhibited satisfactory performances.","2024","Annals of medicine"

Therefore, we used machine learning (ML) algorithm to develop models to predict frailty risk in the elderly. A prospective cohort study. We collected data on 6997 elderly people from Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study wave 6-7 surveys (2011-2012, 2014). After the baseline survey in 1998 (wave 1), the project conducted follow-up surveys (wave 2-8) in 2000-2018. The osteoporotic fractures index was used to assess frailty. Four ML algorithms (random forest [RF], support vector machine, XGBoost and logistic regression [LR]) were used to develop models to identify the risk factors of frailty and predict the risk of frailty. Different ML models were used for the prediction of frailty risk in the elderly and frailty risk was trained on a cohort of 4385 elderly people with frailty (split into a training cohort [75%] and internal validation cohort [25%]). The best-performing model for each study outcome was tested in an external validation cohort of 6997 elderly people with frailty pooled from the surveys (wave 6-7). Model performance was assessed by receiver operating curve and F2-score. Among the four ML models, the F2-score values were similar (0.91 vs. 0.91 vs. 0.88 vs. 0.90), and the area under the curve (AUC) values of RF model was the highest (0.75), followed by LR model (0.74). In the final two models, the AUC values of RF and LR model were similar (0.77 vs. 0.76) and their accuracy was identical (87.4% vs. 87.4%). Our study developed a preliminary prediction model based on two different ML approaches to help predict frailty risk in the elderly. The presented models from this study can be used to inform healthcare providers to predict the frailty probability among older adults and maybe help guide the development of effective frailty risk management interventions. Detecting frailty at an early stage and implementing timely targeted interventions may help to improve the allocation of health care resources and to reduce frailty-related burden. Identifying risk factors for frailty could be beneficial to provide tailored and personalized care intervention for older adults to more accurately prevent or improve their frail conditions so as to improve their quality of life.

This retrospective study included 360 patients with uterine fibroids who received HIFU treatment, including Center A (training set: N = 240; internal testing set: N = 60) and Center B (external testing set: N = 60) and were classified as having a favorable or unfavorable prognosis based on the postoperative non-perfusion volume ratio. A deep transfer learning approach was used to construct super-resolution DWI (SR-DWI) based on conventional high-resolution DWI (HR-DWI), and 1198 radiomics features were extracted from manually segmented regions of interest in both image types. Following data preprocessing and feature selection, radiomics models were constructed for HR-DWI and SR-DWI using Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest (RF), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) algorithms, with performance evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) and decision curves. All DWI radiomics models demonstrated superior AUC in predicting HIFU ablated uterine fibroids prognosis compared to expert radiologists (AUC: 0.706, 95% CI: 0.647-0.748). When utilizing different machine learning algorithms, the HR-DWI model achieved AUC values of 0.805 (95% CI: 0.679-0.931) with SVM, 0.797 (95% CI: 0.672-0.921) with RF, and 0.770 (95% CI: 0.631-0.908) with LightGBM.

Nonetheless, predicting postoperative reflux symptom improvement has been primarily dependent on acid-based parameters. No objective index reflecting both acid and nonacid reflux was identified to select ARS candidates. Prospectively collected data of 121 patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), who underwent laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication from two institutions, were retrospectively reviewed. The patients reported preoperative and postoperative GERD symptoms using the Korean version of the GERD questionnaire, along with the gastroesophageal reflux disease-health-related quality of life (GERD-HRQL). The patients were assessed for reflux symptoms using bolus exposure, acid exposure time (AET), and DeMeester score (DMS) as measurements were selected. For each reflux parameter, its association, correlation, and predictive capacity of the degree of postoperative symptom resolution were analyzed using χ2 tests, point-biserial correlations, logistic regression analyses, and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. Seventy-two patients were eligible for this study. Bolus exposure was superior to the other parameters in terms of the degree of association and correlation with a resolution of typical symptoms. Bolus exposure also showed a higher diagnostic accuracy in predicting the resolution of epigastric pain (area under the curve [AUC]=0.723, P =0.013) and regurgitation (AUC=0.981, P <0.001). Secondary analyses were performed in patients without pathological reflux, defined as the DMS-negative (DMS <14.7) or AET-negative (AET <6%) groups. In the secondary analyses, bolus exposure showed considerable diagnostic accuracy with statistical significance for all typical symptoms in both the DMS-negative (heartburn: AUC=0.717, P =0.025; epigastric pain: AUC=0.717, P =0.025; regurgitation: AUC=0.975, P <0.001) and AET-negative (heartburn: AUC=0.681, P =0.045; epigastric pain: AUC=0.749, P =0.009; regurgitation: AUC=0.975, P <0.001) groups. Bolus exposure, a parameter of total reflux, was superior to AET or DMS in defining candidates for ARS.

We used dynamic contrast-enhanced based golden-angle radial sparse parallel (GRASP) MRI to characterize the vascular permeability changes underlying this phenomenon, with correlations to long-term tumor regression. Consecutive patients with vestibular schwannoma who underwent SRS between 2017 and 2019, had a transient loss of enhancement after SRS, and had long-term longitudinal GRASP studies (6, 18, and 30 months) were included in this retrospective cohort analysis (n = 19). Using GRAVIS ( https://gravis-imaging.org/gravis/ ), an analysis pipeline for GRASP studies, we extracted the key parameters normalized to the venous sinus from a region of interest within the tumor. The peak, area under the curve (AUC), and wash-in phase slope were significantly reduced at 6, 18, and 30 months after SRS (corrected P < .05), even while the internal enhancement returned in the tumors. Larger pre-SRS tumors were more likely to have a greater reduction in peak ( P = .013) and AUC ( P = .029) at 6 months. In a subset of patients (N = 13) with long-term follow-up, the median percentage reduction in tumor volume was 58% at a median of 62 months. These patients showed a strong correlation between peak, AUC, and wash-in phase slope changes at 6 months and tumor volume at the last follow-up. After SRS and loss of internal contrast uptake within vestibular schwannomas, a slow vascular permeability dynamic persisted, suggesting the presence of postradiation processes such as fibrosis. We show for the first time, using GRASP, a quantitative assessment of the vascular radiobiological effect.","2024","Neurosurgery"

Arsenic exposure manifests as variegated pigmentation and characteristic pitted keratosis on the hands and feet, which often precede the onset of internal cancers. Traditionally, human arsenic exposure is estimated through arsenic levels in biological tissues; however, these methods are invasive and time-consuming. This study aims to develop a noninvasive approach to predict arsenic exposure using artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze photographs of hands and feet. By incorporating well water consumption data and arsenic concentration levels, we developed an AI algorithm trained on 9988 hand and foot photographs from 2497 subjects. This algorithm correlates visual features of palmoplantar hyperkeratosis with arsenic exposure levels. Four pictures per patient, capturing both ventral and dorsal aspects of hands and feet, were analyzed. The AI model utilized existing arsenic exposure data, including arsenic concentration (AC) and cumulative arsenic exposure (CAE), to make binary predictions of high and low arsenic exposure. The AI model achieved an optimal area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.813 for AC and 0.779 for CAE. Recall and precision metrics were 0.729 and 0.705 for CAE, and 0.750 and 0.763 for AC, respectively. While biomarkers have traditionally been used to assess arsenic exposure, efficient noninvasive methods are lacking. To our knowledge, this is the first study to leverage deep learning for noninvasive arsenic exposure assessment. Despite challenges with binary classification due to imbalanced and sparse data, this approach demonstrates the potential for noninvasive estimation of arsenic concentration. Future studies should focus on increasing data volume and categorizing arsenic concentration statistics to enhance model accuracy. This rapid estimation method could significantly contribute to epidemiological studies and aid physicians in diagnosis.","2024","Journal of hazardous materials"

In this retrospective, single-center study, we included 79 female patients with BI-RADS 3 lesions and risk factors who underwent biopsy following magnetic resonance imaging. Three readers (two experienced breast radiologists and a radiology resident) blinded evaluated the lesions using KS. Lesions with a KS ≤ 4 were considered benign. Results were compared with the histopathological findings (gold standard) assessing sensitivity and specificity along with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for each reader. Inter-reader agreement was assessed using Fleiss' kappa with 95 % CIs. Moreover, Cohen's kappa was used to assess concordance between two readers at time. 79 female patients (mean age, 50.9 ± 12.2 (standard deviation)) were evaluated. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the three readers was excellent: 0.99, 0.99, and 0.90), respectively. The sensitivity of the two breast radiologists and the resident was 0.92 (95 % CI: 0.62 - 0.99), 1.00 (95 % CI: 0.95 - 1.00) and 0.75 (95 % CI: 0.42 - 0.95), respectively, while the specificity was 1.00 (95 % CI: 0.95---1.00), 0.99 (95 % CI: 0.92 - 1.00), and 1.00 (95 % CI: 0.95 - 1.00) respectively. By using a KS ≤ 4 value to indicate benignity, 66 to 67 biopsies (84 to 85 % of all the biopsies) would have been avoided. Inter-reader concordance via Fleiss' kappa was 0.792 (95 % CI: 0.68 - 0.91).

We retrospectively analyzed a data set of Hispanic patients with breast cancer and newly diagnosed brain metastases from 2009 to 2023 at a single referral center. For each prognostic tool, Kaplan-Meier curves were built. The performances of the models were compared using the area under the curve (AUC), C-statistic, and Akaike information criteria (AIC). Of 492 patients, the median time from breast cancer to brain metastasis diagnosis was 22.7 months (IQR, 12.1-53.3). The median overall survival was 11.6 months (95% CI, 9.9-13.4). All models were validated as prognostic tools (P < .001). The model with the better performance was the breast graded prognostic assessment (GPA; AIC, 402; AUC, 0.65), followed by the modified GPA (AIC, 406; AUC, 0.64), the disease-specific GPA (AIC, 407; AUC, 0.62), recursive partitioning analysis (AIC, 421; AUC, 0.62), and GPA (AIC, 422; AUC, 0.60).

Approximately 4h after feeding, a blood sample was taken from 3.5 year old sows born by artificial insemination (AI group, n = 7) and transfer of in vitro produced embryos (IVP group, n = 11) to determine the physiological concentrations of the main biomarkers of carbohydrates (glucose and lactate), proteins (albumin, creatinine and urea) and lipids (cholesterol and triglycerides). Four weeks later, an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT; 1.75g glucose/kg body weight) was performed after an overnight fast and 1h of water withdrawal. Blood samples were obtained prior (T = 0 min; fasting conditions) and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240 min after glucose intake. At each time point, glycemia was measured immediately using glucometer test strips, and serum was collected to determine the above metabolites along with insulin and glucagon. After OGTT, the area under the curve (AUC) between sampling times and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA) indices were calculated. Under physiological conditions, the concentration of metabolites studied was similar between AI and IVP sows. In both groups, fasting decreased cholesterol and increased triglycerides and urea (P < 0.001). However, creatinine and lactate were similar in both groups under physiological and fasting conditions. The expected increase in albuminemia and decrease in glycaemia after fasting was only observed in IVP sows. OGTT revealed a different glucose curve pattern (monophasic in AI and biphasic in IVP group), a lower mean concentration of cholesterol, glucose, lactate, triglycerides in IVP compared to AI pigs (P < 0.01), and a higher mean concentration of albumin, creatinine and insulin in IVP compared to AI group (P < 0.05). On the contrary, no differences were found between groups for mean serum glucagon and urea levels, nor for glucose homeostasis indices HOMA-IR and HOMA-%B. The AUC differed between groups at several time points with larger AUC for creatinine, and smaller AUC for glucose, glucagon, and triglycerides, in IVP pigs than in AI pigs at 180-210 min (P < 0.05). In conclusion, under physiological conditions the metabolic profile of fully-grown AI and IVP sows is similar and within normal ranges. Glucose challenge revealed differences in metabolic and insulin responses between groups but with normal glucose tolerance in both cases.","2024","Theriogenology"

Previous studies have demonstrated the predictive capacity of histology or expression features in isolation. Few studies, however, have investigated how paired histologic image features and expression patterns from the retrieved clots can improve understanding of clot pathobiology and our ability to predict long-term prognosis. We hypothesized that computational models trained using clot histomics and mRNA expression can predict early neurological improvement (ENI) and 90-day functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale Score, mRS) better than models developed using histological composition or expression data alone. We performed paired histological and transcriptomic analysis of 32 stroke clots. ENI was defined as a delta-National Institutes of Health Stroke Score/Scale > 4, and a good long-term outcome was defined as mRS ≤2 at 90 days after procedure. Clots were H&E-stained and whole-slide imaged at 40×. An established digital pathology pipeline was used to extract 237 histomic features and to compute clot percent composition (%Comp). When dichotomized by either the ENI or mRS thresholds, differentially expressed genes were identified as those with absolute fold-change >1.5 and q < 0.05. Machine learning with recursive feature elimination (RFE) was used to select clot features and evaluate computational models for outcome prognostication. For ENI, RFE identified 9 optimal histologic and transcriptomic features for the hybrid model, which achieved an accuracy of 90.8% (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.98 ± 0.08) in testing and outperformed models based on histomics (AUC = 0.94 ± 0.09), transcriptomics (AUC = 0.86 ± 0.16), or %Comp (AUC = 0.70 ± 0.15) alone. For mRS, RFE identified 7 optimal histomic and transcriptomic features for the hybrid model. This model achieved an accuracy of 93.7% (AUC = 0.94 ± 0.09) in testing, also outperforming models based on histomics (AUC = 0.90 ± 0.11), transcriptomics (AUC = 0.55 ± 0.27), or %Comp (AUC = 0.58 ± 0.16) alone.

Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) performed for 10 days was used to calculate AG10. Immediately after CGM, HbA1c and glycated albumin were measured. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) and glucose area under the curve (AUC) were derived from a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test. The relationship between AG10 and HbA1c was significantly different for NHB compared with NHW patients and those of other racial/ethnic groups. HbA1c levels were 0.2-0.6 percentage points higher in NHB than in NHW patients for AG10 levels from 100 to 250 mg/dL. For an HbA1c of 7%, AG10 was 11 mg/dL higher for NHW than for NHB patients. Similar findings were observed across races for relationships of FPG and AUC with HbA1c and for glucose measurements with glycated albumin levels. Differences in the relationship between AG10 and HbA1c across racial groups remained after adjustments for any demographic or other differences between racial/ethnic subgroups. The relationship between several measures of glucose with HbA1c and glycated albumin consistently differed across races. These findings should be considered in setting treatment goals and diagnostic levels.","2024","Diabetes care"

However, effective biomarkers for early detection remain elusive. This study aimed to integrate methylome and transcriptome data to identify DNA methylation markers for the early detection of GCA and ESCC. In the discovery stage, we conducted Infinium MethylationEPIC array analysis on 36 paired GCA and non-tumor adjacent tissues (NAT), identifying differentially methylated CpG sites (DMCs) between GCA/ESCC and NAT through combined analyses of in-house and publicly available data. In the validation stage, targeted pyrosequencing and quantitative real-time RT-PCR were performed on paired tumor and NAT samples from 50 GCA and 50 ESCC patients. In the application stage, an independent set of 438 samples, including GCA, ESCC, high- and low-grade dysplasia (HGD/LGD), and normal controls, was tested for selected DMCs using pyrosequencing. Our analysis validated three GCA-specific, two ESCC-specific, and one tumor-shared DMCs, exhibiting significant hypermethylation and decreased expression of target genes in tumor samples compared with NAT. Leveraging these DMCs, we developed a GCA-specific 4-marker panel (cg27284428, cg11798358, cg07880787, and cg00585116) with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.917, effectively distinguishing between cardia HGD/GCA patients and cardia LGD/normal controls. Similarly, an ESCC-specific 3-marker panel (cg14633892, cg04415798, and cg00585116) achieved an AUC of 0.865 in distinguishing esophageal HGD/ESCC cases. Furthermore, integrating cg00585116, age, and alcohol consumption yielded a tumor-shared logistic model with good discrimination for two cancer/HGD (AUC, 0.767; 95% confidence interval, 0.720-0.813). The mean AUC of the model after 5-fold cross-validation was 0.764. In summary, our study identifies novel DNA methylation markers capable of accurately distinguishing GCA/ESCC and HGD from LGD and normal controls. These findings offer promising prospects for targeted DNA methylation assays in future minimally invasive cancer screening methods.","2024","Science China. Life sciences"

Specimens were analyzed on Architect i2000, Architect c8000 (both from Abbott, Chicago, Ill, USA), or Luminex xMAP machines (MilliporeSigma, St. Louis, Mo, USA). FIT analyses and blood-based biomarker data were combined with clinical data (ie, age and colonoscopy findings) in a cross-validated logistic regression model (algorithm) benchmarked against a model solely using the FIT result (FIT model) applying different cutoffs for FIT positivity. The cohort included individuals with CRC (n = 240), adenomas (n = 938), or no neoplastic lesions (n = 799). The cross-validated algorithm combining the 8 biomarkers, quantitative FIT result, and age performed superior to the FIT model in discriminating CRC versus non-CRC individuals (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.77 vs 0.67, respectively; P < .001). When discriminating individuals with either CRC or high- or medium-risk adenomas versus low-risk adenomas or clean colorectum, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve were 0.68 versus 0.64 for the algorithm and FIT model, respectively. The algorithm presented here can improve patient allocation to colonoscopy, reducing colonoscopy burden without compromising cancer and adenoma detection rates or vice versa.","2024","Gastrointestinal endoscopy"

A cross-sectional diagnostic study on a convenience sample of 408 consecutive subjects was conducted by applying three non-clinical index tests estimating different features of the periodontal health-disease spectrum: a self-administered questionnaire, an oral rinse activated matrix metalloproteinase-8 (aMMP-8) point-of-care test (POCT) and determination of gingival bleeding on brushing (GBoB). Full-mouth periodontal examination was the reference standard. The periodontal diagnosis was made on the basis of the 2017 classification of periodontal diseases and conditions. Logistic regression and random forest (RF) analyses were performed to predict various periodontal diagnoses, and the accuracy measures were assessed. Four-hundred and eight subjects were enrolled in this study, including those with periodontal health (16.2%), gingivitis (15.2%) and stage I (15.9%), stage II (15.9%), stage III (29.7%) and stage IV (7.1%) periodontitis. Nine predictors, namely 'gum disease' (Q1), 'a rating of gum/teeth health' (Q2), 'tooth cleaning' (Q3a), the symptom of 'loose teeth' (Q4), 'use of floss' (Q7), aMMP-8 POCT, self-reported GBoB, haemoglobin and age, resulted in high levels of accuracy in the RF classifier. High accuracy (area under the ROC curve > 0.94) was observed for the discrimination of three (health, gingivitis and periodontitis) and six classes (health, gingivitis, stages I, II, III and IV periodontitis). Confusion matrices showed that the misclassification of a periodontitis case as health or gingivitis was less than 1%-2%. Machine learning-based classifiers, such as RF analyses, are promising tools for multiclass assessment of periodontal health and disease in a non-clinical setting. Results need to be externally validated in appropriately sized independent samples (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03928080).","2024","Journal of clinical periodontology"

Despite the availability of well-validated self-report and clinical instruments to measure symptom severity, there has been no study to establish optimal thresholds for determining treatment response based on these measures. Data from 553 participants (aged 18-65 years) who had participated in previous pharmacological and psychotherapeutic clinical trials for gambling disorder were aggregated. Studies were included that collected Clinical Global Impression Improvement (CGI-I) at end-of-study (reference standard), as well as baseline and end-of-study symptom severity using the Gambling Symptom Assessment Scale (GSAS) and/or the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale Modified for Pathological Gambling (PG-YBOCS). Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) analyses were conducted to identify optimal thresholds for determining treatment response. Greater than 50% improvement in PG-YBOCS and 35% improvement in GSAS were the optimal thresholds for defining treatment response. For the PG-YBOCS, the cutoff had acceptable sensitivity and specificity (85.0%, 83.0%) and area under the curve of 0.904. For the GSAS, the cutoff had acceptable sensitivity and specificity (81.2%, 73.4%), and area under the curve of 0.859. This study provides useful thresholds on two widely used, valid outcome measures for gambling disorder, in terms of determining treatment response or absence thereof. These thresholds may be useful for clinical practice at the level of individual patients, but also for future clinical trials.","2024","Journal of psychiatric research"

This single-center, retrospective analysis included adult septic patients admitted to Saga University Hospital from 2013 to 2017, with available ROTEM data. Hypofibrinolysis was assessed using the lysis index at 60 min (LI60) in extrinsic thromboelastometry (EXTEM). Based on their LI60 values, patients were classified into three groups: Hyper (LI60 ≤ 85), Normal (LI60 86-96), and Hypo (LI60 ≥ 97). Among the 63 cases analyzed, the Hypo group showed significantly higher APACHEII and SOFA scores than the Normal group, indicating greater disease severity. Similarly, DIC and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) scores were notably higher in the Hypo group. The diagnostic performance of LI60 for ISTH-overt DIC showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.954, with an optimal cutoff value of 97 %, achieving 100 % sensitivity and 83.3 % specificity. The odds ratio for ISTH-overt DIC was 2.894, indicating a strong association between elevated LI60 and occurrence of DIC. Hypofibrinolysis predicted 28-day mortality and high SOFA scores (≥ 10) with high specificity and negative predictive value (NPV). A Kaplan-Meier curve revealed that the Hypo Group showed significantly worse clinical outcomes than the Normal and Hyper groups. For septic patients, fibrinolysis suppression presenting as ""hypofibrinolysis"" (elevated LI60) is associated with poor prognosis and risk of higher organ dysfunction. Moreover, it is a significant predictor of adverse clinical outcomes in sepsis.","2025","Thrombosis research"

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. All PSI PTS-reducing osteotomies performed at 1 institution between 2019 and 2022 were reviewed. Three-dimensional (3D) accuracy was defined as the mean absolute 3D angular difference between the planned and achieved surgical correction (in degrees) in 3D models of computed tomography data. The influence of OWO versus CWO and the HAA on the reported accuracy was analyzed and a cutoff defined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Eighteen patients who underwent a slope-reducing CWO (n = 9) or OWO (n = 9) were included. The 3D accuracy for PTS was 2.3°± 1.1° (mean ± SD), with CWO being more accurate than OWO (1.4°± 0.9° vs 3.1°± 0.6°; P < .01). Accuracy strongly correlated with the HAA (r = 0.788; P < .01). An HAA >38.9° predicted a PTS error >2° (odds ratio, 1.12 [95% CI, 1.04-1.20; P = .004]; area under the curve, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.89-1.00; P < .001]) corresponding to a coronal/sagittal correction of 0.8:1. Slope-reducing osteotomy can accurately be achieved using PSI. CWO demonstrated an increased accuracy when compared with OWO, which strongly depended on the HAA. With an aim of combined PTS and coronal correction, CWO should be considered the primary choice for accurate slope reduction with a coronal/sagittal correction cutoff of 0.8:1 (HAA, 38.9°).","2024","The American journal of sports medicine"

Weakly supervised DL promotes utilisation of larger training data sets compared to fully supervised (patch annotation) approaches. To evaluate weakly supervised DL image classifiers for discriminating melanomas from naevi on haematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained pathology slides. A representative H&E slide for 260 naevi and 260 melanomas from mucocutaneous sites at one tertiary institution was digitized. Clinicopathological features were recorded for each case including thickness and histological subtype. Whole-slide or whole-tissue section labels were applied. The ground truth was established by consensus diagnosis from two pathologists. Multiple-instance learning models, Trans-MIL, CLAM and DTFD-MIL were evaluated at 10×, 20× and 40× magnifications using stratified fivefold Monte Carlo cross-validation, with 80/10/10 splits for training/validation/test groups, to predict melanoma from naevus. Heatmaps were generated to understand model performance. Naevi cases were younger (median age: 51 years; melanoma median age: 71.5 years), with more balanced sex distribution (males: 48.8%, melanoma male subgroup: 64.2%). The most frequent histological subtypes of naevi and melanomas were dysplastic compound (n = 99, 38.1%) and superficial spreading (n = 124, 47.7%), respectively. Average AUC (±1 SD) for Trans-MIL, CLAM and DTFD-MIL across test groups were 0.9952 ± 0.006, 0.9925 ± 0.0052 and 0.9708 ± 0.0328, at 20× magnification, respectively. Performance of the models varied according to the magnification used. Heatmaps from the two best performing models, Trans-MIL and CLAM, generally indicated attention on appropriate tissue regions for interpretation. Weakly supervised DL on pathological slides of common mucocutaneous melanocytic tumours provides highly accurate diagnostic value for discrimination of melanomas and naevi. External validation and further assessment on less frequently occurring histologic subtypes and borderline cases using this method is required.","2024","Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV"

Recent evidence suggests that perilesional edema volume (PEV) might compromise the delivery and efficacy of radiotherapy to treat BM. This study investigated the association between SRT efficacy and PEV extent in MBM. This retrospective study reviewed medical records from January 2020 to September 2023. Patients with up to 5 measurable MBMs, intracranial disease per RANO/iRANO criteria, and on low-dose corticosteroids were included. MRI scans assessed baseline neuroimaging, with PEV analyzed using 3D Slicer. SRT plans were based on MRI-CT fusion, delivering 18-32.5 Gy in 1-5 fractions. Outcomes included intracranial objective response rate (iORR) and survival measures (L-iPFS and OS). Statistical analysis involved decision tree analysis and multivariable logistic regression, adjusting for clinical and treatment variables. Seventy-two patients with 101 MBM were analyzed, with a mean age of 68.83 years. The iORR was 61.4%, with Complete Response (CR) in 21.8% and Partial Response (PR) in 39.6% of the treated lesions. PEV correlated with KPS, BRAF status, and treatment response. Decision tree analysis identified a PEV cutoff at 0.5 cc, with lower PEVs predicting better responses (AUC = 0.82 sensitivity: 86.7%, specificity:74.4%,). Patients with PEV ≥ 0.5 cc had lower response rates (iORR 44.7% vs. 63.8%, p < 0.001). Median OS was 9.4 months, with L-iPFS of 27 months. PEV significantly impacted survival outcomes.

The primary objective of the study is to determine the progression free survival for patients with newly diagnosed ES-SCLC treated with combination multisite SBRT and chemo-immunotherapy (carboplatin, etoposide, and durvalumab). This is a multicenter, single arm, phase 2 study. Patients with treatment-naïve, ES-SCLC will be eligible for this study. Patients will receive durvalumab 1500mg IV q3w, carboplatin AUC 5 to 6 mg/mL q3w, and etoposide 80 to 100 mg/m2 on days 1 to 3 q3w for four cycles, followed by durvalumab 1500mg IV q4w until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Ablative radiation will be delivered 1 to 4 extracranial sites in 3 or 5 fractions, determined by location, during cycle 2. The primary endpoint is progression-free survival, measured from day 1 of chemoimmunotherapy. Secondary endpoints include grade ≥3 toxicity by CTCAE v5.0 within three months of RT, overall survival, response rate, time to second line systemic therapy, and time to new distant progression. Now that immunotherapy is an established part of ES-SCLC management, it is important to further optimize its use and effect. This study will investigate the progression-free survival of combined SBRT and chemo-immunotherapy in patients with ES-SCLC. In addition, the data from this study may further inform the immunogenic role of SBRT with chemo-immunotherapy, as well as identify clinical, biological, or radiomic prognostic features.","2024","Clinical lung cancer"

Although current earthquake early warning systems can provide alerts several seconds in advance, acute stress responses (ASR) in emergency situations can waste these precious escape seconds. To investigate the correlation between personality and ASR, this study collected the temperament and character of all participants using the Chen Huichang-60 Temperament Scale and the DISC Personality Inventory. In addition, this study simulated growing earthquakes in an earthquake experience hall, collecting heart rate variability and respiration signal variations throughout the process from subjects. Multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) and Toeplitz Inverse Covariance-Based Clustering methods were used to analyse the differences and connections between them. Furthermore, this study employed a deep learning model that combines Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict ASR across personalities. This model used datasets from the majority dataset of a certain personality and a single participant, respectively, and showed different performance. The results are as follows. After categorising participants based on personality test results, MANOVA revealed significant differences between the personality groups Influence-Choleric and Influence-Sanguine (p = 0.001), Influence-Phlegmatic and Steadiness-Sanguine (p = 0.023), Influence-Sanguine and Steadiness-Sanguine (p < 0.001) and Influence-Sanguine and Steadiness-Phlegmatic (p < 0.001), as well as across different earthquake stages (p < 0.01). The clustering method quantified stress responses over time for different personalities and labelled ASR levels for use in supervised learning. Ultimately, the CNN-LSTM model performed predictions of ASR using both personality and individual datasets, achieving the AUC of 0.795 and 0.72, demonstrating better prediction and classification effectiveness with the former. This study provides a new personality-based method for earthquake stress management, creating possibilities for longitudinal stress research and prediction. It aids the general public in comprehending their own acute stress and allows authorities and communities to make practical, efficient disaster evacuation plans based on the overall situation of public ASR.","2024","Stress and health : journal of the International Society for the Investigation of Stress"

Participant characteristics, MSWS-12, and falls in the last six months were collected on PwMS (n = 171) during a single session. Fallers (53.8 %; n = 92) were individuals reporting ≥ 1 fall in the past six months. A receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) curve was performed to estimate the classification accuracy (area under the curve; AUC) of the MSWS-12 at detecting fallers. Optimal cut-off scores were calculated using the Youden Index and Index of Union methods. The dichotomized MSWS-12 cut-off score was then entered into a logistic regression, with faller status as the outcome, and age, gender, body mass index, disease duration, and fatigue as covariates. The MSWS-12 had a fair classification accuracy for identifying fallers (AUC = 0.74), with the cut-off score of ≥ 46 % having 76.1 % sensitivity and 64.6 % specificity. The MSWS-12 cut-off score remained a significant predictor of faller status in the adjusted model (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.77, 95 % CI: 1.75, 8.15, P = .001), along with higher fatigue (aOR: 1.11, 95 % CI: 1.02, 1.20, P = .015). PwMS with MSWS-12 scores ≥ 46 % were more likely to be fallers than those with lower scores.

Frailty was assessed using the fried frailty phenotype (FFP). Anterior thigh muscle thickness was measured by ultrasound, and the sonographic thigh adjustment ratio (STAR) index was calculated. Muscle strength was measured using a hand dynamometer. Physical activity was determined by the physical activity scale for the elderly (PASE). The median (interquartile range) age and follow-up time were 65 years (62 to 71) and 11 years (7.0 to 14.2), respectively. The median TSH level was 1.10 μIU/mL (0.49 to 1.62), and 58.6% of patients were prefrail/frail. Muscle mass and strength were reduced in 35.7% and 17.2% of patients, respectively. TSH levels were lower in those with prefrailty/frailty (P=0.002), low muscle mass (P=0.014), and low strength (P=0.037) than in their normal counterparts. TSH levels correlated negatively with FFP (P= 0.001) and positively with the STAR index (P=0.034). TSH below 1.325 μIU/mL was associated with an increased frailty risk (area under the curve=0.719; P=0.001). Low TSH, female sex, low handgrip strength, and low PASE leisure time scores emerged as independent predictors of frailty (P<0.05). Older adults with lower TSH levels due to DTC are at high frailty risk and have low muscle mass and strength. Therefore, TSH targets should be set based on a comprehensive evaluation with consideration of the risk-benefit ratio.","2024","Endocrinology and metabolism (Seoul, Korea)"

Clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging were obtained from the Parkinson's Progression Marker Initiative database, comprising 36 PD-EDS and 98 PD patients without EDS (PD-nEDS). The computational anatomy toolbox was utilized to derive sulcus depth (SD) and deep grey matter (GM) nuclei volumes. PD-EDS patients exhibited significantly decreased SD values in the right caudal middle frontal gyrus, pars opercularis, and superior temporal cortex relative to PD-nEDS patients. However, no significant differences in deep GM nuclei volumes were identified. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses further revealed that these cortical SD values could potentially serve as a screening index for distinguishing PD-EDS from PD-nEDS. Additionally, although PD-EDS patients had a longer disease duration and poorer performance in motor function and depression compared to PD-nEDS patients, these factors were included as covariates in the neuroimaging analyses.

To address these issues, we developed the Revised qSOFA score (RqSOFA) that consists of percutaneous oxygen saturation, oxygen usage, Simple Shock Index, and the parameters of qSOFA. The predictability of RqSOFA was examined for in-hospital mortality among patients who were transported by ambulance. This observational cohort study included all patients transported via ambulance to an Emergency Department between 2019 and 2021. Patients who had prehospital cardiopulmonary arrest, were pregnant, were younger than 15 years old, arrived from another hospital, and had missing data were excluded. The Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) of RqSOFA, as well as its sensitivity and specificity at the optimal cut-off point, were determined and compared to those of qSOFA, NEWS and MqSOFA. Among 1849 included patients, 53 died in the hospital. The AUROC for RqSOFA was 0.867 and the optimal cut-off point was 2. The sensitivity and specificity were 0.849 and 0.802, respectively.

Endothelium-related biomarkers included syndecan-1, ICAM-1, VCAM-1 and angiopoietin-2 (AGPT2). Patients were followed up for 4 years, and cognitive assessments were repeated. Multinomial regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between biomarkers and cognitive decline. A total of 216 patients completed the test battery at baseline. After 4 years, 102 patients had follow-up data. There was a significant decrease in cognitive function according to the CAMCOG and MMSE scores: a change of -0.39 (95% CI -0.27 to -0.51) and -0.51 (95% CI -0.27 to -0.76) standard deviation (SD) of the baseline scores. Additionally, executive function but not memory significantly decreased. Syndecan-1 level was independently associated with steeper cognitive decline; each increase in the SD of the syndecan-1 level was associated with a decrease in the CAMCOG of 0.20 (95% CI 0.07-0.33) SD from baseline. Syndecan-1 was associated with a steeper decline in MMSE score (β 0.54, 95% CI 0.28-0.81) and executive function (β 0.17, 95% CI 0.02-0.32). Syndecan-1 predicted severe cognitive impairment with an area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic curves of 0.75 (95% CI 0.64-0.83).

From 11 eligible studies (1 prospective, 10 retrospective), statistical analysis revealed a significant difference in sensitivity between FP-MRI (95%) and AB-MRI (86%, P = .005), with no significant difference in specificity (P = .50). AB-MRI's shorter acquisition time suggests potential for higher patient throughput, but challenges remain in detecting small lesions and nonmass enhancements. Some studies recommend additional sequences, like diffusion-weighted imaging, to improve diagnostic performance. While FP-MRI remains the gold standard in breast cancer detection, AB-MRI offers a quicker alternative, especially in high-risk screening. However, its lower sensitivity limits its use as a standalone diagnostic tool. Future research should optimize AB-MRI protocols and consider patient-specific factors to enhance breast cancer screening and diagnostic strategies. This meta-analysis expands understanding of AB-MRI's role in breast cancer detection, highlighting its benefits and limitations compared to FP-MRI, particularly in terms of sensitivity and screening efficiency.","2024","The British journal of radiology"
192,"39220685","A step forward in the diagnosis of urinary tract infections: from machine learning to clinical practice.","Urinary tract infections (UTIs) are common infections within the Emergency Department (ED), causing increased laboratory workloads and unnecessary antibiotics prescriptions. The aim of this study was to improve UTI diagnostics in clinical practice by application of machine learning (ML) models for real-time UTI prediction. In a retrospective study, patient information and outcomes from Emergency Department patients, with positive and negative culture results, were used to design models - 'Random Forest' and 'Neural Network' - for the prediction of UTIs. The performance of these predictive models was validated in a cross-sectional study. In a quasi-experimental study, the impact of UTI risk assessment was investigated by evaluating changes in the behaviour of clinicians, measuring changes in antibiotic prescriptions and urine culture requests. First, we trained and tested two different predictive models with 8692 cases. Second, we investigated the performance of the predictive models in clinical practice with 962 cases (Area under the curve was between 0.81 to 0.88). The best performance was the combination of both models. Finally, the assessment of the risk for UTIs was implemented into clinical practice and allowed for the reduction of unnecessary urine cultures and antibiotic prescriptions for patients with a low risk of UTI, as well as targeted diagnostics and treatment for patients with a high risk of UTI. The combination of modern urinalysis diagnostic technologies with digital health solutions can help to further improve UTI diagnostics with positive impact on laboratory workloads and antimicrobial stewardship.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

However, additional research is necessary to establish the prognostic significance and possible role of UBD in glioma. Transcriptomic expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) and Chinese Glioma Genome Atlas (CGGA) were analyzed to identify UBD expression differences in tumor and normal tissues. The relative levels of UBD in glioma and normal tissues were determined using qRT-PCR and WB. Logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the association between UBD expression and clinicopathological characteristics of glioma patients. To evaluate the diagnostic and prognostic predictive values of UBD, we used Kaplan-Meier survival curves, Cox regression analysis, diagnostic receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and nomogram model. We also conducted wound healing assays, transwell assays, EdU assays, and colony formation assays to verify the UBD function. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway analysis, as well as gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA), were employed to determine the functions of UBD. Finally, we performed the western blot assays to assess changes in EMT markers as well as p-PI3K, p-AKT, and p-mTOR expressions. Our study revealed a remarkable increase of UBD expression in glioma samples. Cox regression analysis demonstrated that high expression of UBD mRNA was an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) in TCGA. ROC curve analysis showed that UBD expression levels could differentiate glioma from adjacent normal tissues accurately. Additionally, knockdown of UBD reduced the migration, invasion, and proliferation ability of glioma cells while UBD overexpression had the opposite effect. GSEA showed that the expression of UBD involved with various pathways including epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling, P53 pathway, angiogenesis, inflammatory response, KRAS signaling, hypoxia, as well as TGF-β signaling. Furthermore, our findings suggest that UBD accelerates the activation of EMT and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway.","2024","Environmental toxicology"

This was a double-center retrospective study. The data of patients were retrospectively collected from two tertiary hospitals in Chongqing, China. The patients were divided into training and validation cohorts according to the ratio of 7:3. In the training cohort, the factors related to the recurrence were screened through uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis, and a nomogram was constructed based on this. Internal and external validation of the model was performed in two cohorts, respectively. In the training cohort, the optimal risk threshold of the model was determined by using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the maximum value of the Youden index. A total of 1348 patients were included, including 944 in the training cohort and 404 in the validation cohort. Multivariate analysis suggested that ER expression, P53 expression and other clinicopathologic parameters, were significantly related to recurrence. On this basis, a nomogram was constructed to predict 1-, 3-, and 5-year recurrence-free survival (RFS) rate. The model had good predictive accuracy in both cohorts through the validation. The ROC curve and Youden index suggested that the optimal risk threshold of 3-year RFS rate predicted by the model was 0.83, and there was a significant survival difference between the high- and low-risk groups. Compared to traditional prediction models, the model proposed in this study that combined molecular indicators and clinicopathologic parameters can better predict the prognosis of EC patients.","2024","International journal of gynaecology and obstetrics: the official organ of the International Federation of Gynaecology and Obstetrics"

Retrospective cohort study. Academic trauma center. Patients aged 16 years or older with an operatively treated open tibia fracture (OTA-AO 41, 42, and 43) between 2010 and 2021. The primary outcome was FRI. The OTA-OFC and the Gustilo-Anderson classifications were compared in their ability to predict FRI. Eight hundred ninety patients (mean age, 43 years [range, 17 to 96]; 75% men) with 912 open tibia fractures were included. In total, 142 (16%) had an infection. The OTA-OFC was not significantly better at predicting FRI than the Gustilo-Anderson classification (area under the curve, 0.66 vs. 0.66; P = 0.89). The Gustilo-Anderson classification was a stronger predictor of FRI than any single OTA-OFC domain, explaining 72% of FRI variance. Only the addition of the OTA-OFC wound contamination domain to Gustilo-Anderson significantly increased the variance explained (72% vs. 84%, P = 0.04). Embedded contamination increased the risk of FRI by approximately 10% as the risk of FRI with embedded contamination was 16% for type I or type IIs, 26% for type IIIAs, 45% for type IIIBs, and 46% for type IIICs. The more complex OTA-OFC system was not better than the Gustilo-Anderson classification system in predicting FRIs in patients with open tibia fractures. Adding embedded wound contamination to the Gustilo-Anderson classification system significantly improved its prognostic ability. Prognostic Level III.

Therefore, we analyzed the risk factors of malnutrition in patients with TBI and developed a model to predict the risk of malnutrition. A retrospective collection of 345 patients with TBI, and they were divided into malnutrition and comparison groups according to the occurrence of malnutrition. Univariate correlation and multifactor logistic regression analyses were performed to determine patients' malnutrition risk factors. We used univariate and logistic regression (forward stepwise method) analyses to identify significant predictors associated with malnutrition in patients with TBI and developed a predictive model for malnutrition prediction. The model's discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility were evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 216 patients (62.6%) developed malnutrition. Multifactorial logistic regression analysis showed that pulmonary infection, urinary tract infection, dysphagia, application of NGT, GCS score ≤ 8, and low ADL score were independent risk factors for malnutrition in patients with TBI (P < 0.05). The area under the curve of the model was 0.947. Calibration plots showed good discrimination of model calibration. DCA showed that the column line plot models were all clinically meaningful when nutritional interventions were performed over a considerable range of threshold probabilities (0-0.98).

Horses were blocked by degree of IS and assigned randomly to treatment: oral daily bolus (50 mL) of either a plant derived EO supplement or carrier (CON). Mares were housed in dry lots with ad libitum access to grass hay and supplemented individually twice daily with a concentrate to meet nutrient requirements for mature horses. Before and after 6 wks of treatment, mares underwent a combined glucose-insulin tolerance test (CGIT) and an oral sugar test (OST) on separate days. Global metabolome analysis was conducted on plasma samples before and after treatment. Although treatment did not affect (p > 0.4) AUC or glucose clearance during CGIT, there was a treatment*covariate interaction (p ≤ 0.08) for insulin concentrations at 75 min (INS75) and positive phase time (PT) with EO decreasing both INS75 (p ≤ 0.002) and PT (p = 0.05) in horses with more severe initial degree of ID. Similarly, EO treatment reduced (p ≤ 0.006) insulinemic response to the OST in horses exhibiting higher pre-treatment responses (treatment*covariate, p = 0.004). There were 702 metabolites identified that were uniquely changed with EO treatment. Pathway analysis and biomarkers showed EO-mediated changes in amino acid, linoleic acid, mesaconic acid, TCA-cyle intermediates and bile acid metabolism. The directional changes in these pathways or biomarkers are consistent with changes in inulin sensitivity in other models. These data show that EO shifted the plasma metabolome and improved insulin sensitivity in horses.","2024","Frontiers in veterinary science"

Community pharmacists are increasingly involved in the initiation of medication reviews. Yet, current frailty measurement methods are impractical in this setting. Alternative approaches, leveraging routinely collected data, are needed. To develop a frailty screening tool utilising routine electronic pharmacy records. Community-dwelling older adults (≥ 70 years) using ≥ 5 chronic medications were recruited in 196 Belgian community pharmacies. Frailty was assessed using SHARE-FI75+ (based on Fried's frailty phenotype). Model development was on the basis of a two-stage approach using multivariable logistic regression with split-sample internal validation. Stage 1 considered only electronic pharmacy record variables, while stage 2 also included other variables that can easily be collected in the community pharmacy. Model performance was evaluated for discrimination, calibration and predictive accuracy. We recruited 875 participants [mean ± standard deviation (SD) age 79.3 ± 5.9 years], with 14.8% identified as frail. At stage 1, the frailty screening model included age, sex, reimbursement level of medical expenses, number of chronic medications and medication-derived comorbidities (anxiety, congestive heart failure, hypertension) [area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) 0.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.69-0.85; sensitivity 78.0%; specificity 60.1%]. At stage 2, additional information on difficulties with basic activities of daily living or pharmacist's intuitive frailty assessment further improved the model (AUC 0.81, 95% CI 0.74-0.88 and AUC 0.82, 95% CI 0.75-0.89, respectively).

To address the class imbalance issue, traditional sampling methods like SMOTE and ADASYN were replaced by Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), which leverage deep neural network architectures to generate high-quality synthetic data. The study highlights the advantage of GANs in creating realistic, diverse, and homogeneous samples for the minority class, which plays a significant role in mitigating the diagnostic challenges posed by imbalanced data. Four types of classifiers, Boosting, Bagging, Linear, and Non-linear, were assessed to evaluate their performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. Baseline performance without resampling showed significant limitations, underscoring the need for resampling strategies. Using GAN-generated data notably improved the detection of minority instances and overall classification performance. The average ROC AUC value increased from baseline levels of approximately 0.8276 to over 0.9734, underscoring the effectiveness of GAN-based resampling in enhancing model performance and ensuring more balanced detection across classes. With GAN-based resampling, GradientBoosting classifier achieved a ROC AUC of 0.9890, the highest among all models, demonstrating the effectiveness of GAN-generated data in enhancing performance.

This investigation examined the clinical features and management of aAVP-D in children and adolescents with sellar germ cell tumors (GCTs). A retrospective survey was performed on 260 patients with sellar GCTs, categorized into aAVP-D and non-aAVP-D groups based on thirst presence. General characteristics, hypothalamic syndrome, pituitary function, metabolic indicators, and complications were compared. Biochemical indicator changes in the aAVP-D group were analyzed after systematic management, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis established the optimum serum sodium cut-off for predicting the aAVP-D. 25 patients (9.6%) developed aAVP-D. The aAVP-D group had larger tumors with hypothalamic involvement and more surgical resections. They also demonstrated more hypothalamic syndrome, central adrenal insufficiency, central hypogonadism, and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels below norms. Furthermore, aAVP-D patients exhibited significantly higher rates of hypernatremia (100% vs 20.9%, p < 0.001), hyperuricemia (60.0% vs 23.4%, p < 0.001), renal impairment (32.0% vs 1.7%, p < 0.001), and venous thrombosis (4.0% vs 0%, p = 0.002). Following systematic management, aAVP-D patients experienced significant reductions in serum sodium, uric acid, and creatinine levels, although these remained higher than in the non-aAVP-D group. ROC analysis indicated that a serum sodium level above 149.5 mmol/L predicted aAVP-D. Conclusion Patients with aAVP-D had more tumor involvement in the hypothalamic region, surgical resections, hypothalamic syndrome, hypopituitarism, and complications. Serum sodium levels above 149.5 mmol/L necessitated heightened vigilance for aAVP-D. Early identification and systematic management reduced complications, though clinical management remained challenging.

Two reviewers independently implemented the search strategy. We included all types of original studies published in English that evaluated DL algorithms for automatic analysis of contrast-enhanced mammography CEM images. The quality of the studies was independently evaluated by two reviewers based on the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) criteria. Sixteen relevant studies published between 2018 and 2024 were identified. All but one used convolutional neural network models (CNN) models. All studies evaluated DL algorithms for lesion classification, while six studies also assessed lesion detection or segmentation. Segmentation was performed manually in three studies, both manually and automatically in two studies and automatically in ten studies. For lesion classification on retrospective datasets, CNN models reported varied areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.53 to 0.99.

However, it has poor oral bioavailability. We investigated the effect of a novel lipid formulation on its absorption in humans and on its tissue distribution in mice. Methods: In a double-blind crossover study in fasting healthy volunteers, we compared the pharmacokinetics of a single dose of 1000 mg of CBD in the lipid formulation and in a powder formulation (ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05032807). In a second study, male CD1 mice were administered CBD in either the lipid formulation or dissolved in water, via oral gavage (n = 1 per timepoint). The tissue distribution of CBD was assessed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometric imaging. Results: Plasma exposure (AUC0-48) of CBD was nine times greater for the lipid formulation than the powder formulation (611.1 ng·h/mL [coefficient of variation {CV%}: 104.6] and 66.8 ng·h/mL [CV%: 50.7], respectively). With the powder formulation, the AUC0-48 was related to the concentration of specific gastrointestinal bacteria and bile acids. These associations were attenuated with the lipid formulation. In the animal study, after treatment with the lipid formulation, measurable concentrations of CBD were identified in all organs. For the aqueous formulation, tissue concentrations of CBD were below the limit of quantification. Conclusions: Administering oral CBD in a lipid formulation was associated with an increase in its gastrointestinal absorption, as well as an attenuation of the relationship between its absorption and features of the gut microbiome.","2024","Pharmaceutics"

The design approach, which combined molecular simplification and chain extension, resulted in compounds with potent and selective activity against both drug-susceptible and multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains. The lead molecule, targeting the cytochrome bc1 complex, exhibited favorable kinetic solubility and remarkable chemical stability under acidic conditions. Despite in vitro ADME evaluations showing low permeability and high metabolism in rat microsomes, the lead compound exhibited bacteriostatic activity in a murine macrophage model of TB infection and demonstrated promising in vivo exposure following gavage in mice, with an AUC0-t of 127.5 ± 5.7 μM h. To the best of our knowledge, for the first time, a simplified structure from 2-(quinolin-4-yloxy)acetamides has shown such potential. These findings suggest a new avenue for exploring this chemical class as a source of antituberculosis drug candidates.","2024","Journal of medicinal chemistry"

A retrospective analysis of 214 NMOSD patients identified 181 with AQP4-IgG-seropositive. 32 patients who relapsed during RTX treatment were included, and 122 sets of lymphocyte subset monitoring data were collected. 110 sets of data were finally included and divided into relapse (n = 30) and nonrelapse (n = 80) groups depending on whether a relapse occurred between two adjacent RTX treatments. Logistic and LASSO regressions were used to identify the relevant factors influencing NMOSD relapse, and a nomogram was constructed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to evaluate the nomogram's ability to differentiate, and the bootstrap method was utilized for internal validation. Calibration curve and decision curve analysis were also conducted. Comparing baseline data revealed differences in the RTX administration interval, CD3-CD19+ B lymphocyte and CD3-CD56+ NK cell levels. The RTX administration interval and the level of CD3-CD19+ B lymphocytes were independent variables influencing relapse. The nomogram had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 and a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.58-0.83. The Hosmer-Lemeshow (H-L) goodness-of-fit test yielded a χ2 = 11.80 (p = 0.16). Decision curve analysis revealed that the model provided greater net benefits within the threshold probability range of 0.18-0.98. The nomogram developed in this study showed that the RTX administration interval and CD3-CD19+ B lymphocyte levels independently influence NMOSD relapse, indicating good discriminative ability, consistency, and clinical benefits.","2024","Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology"

Despite the common use of mechanical thrombectomy (MT) in AIS, predictors of poor outcomes in MeVO remain poorly characterized. In this prospectively collected, retrospectively reviewed, multicenter, multinational study, data from the MAD-MT (Multicenter Analysis of primary Distal medium vessel occlusions: effect of Mechanical Thrombectomy) registry were analyzed. The study included 1568 patients from 37 academic centers across North America, Asia, and Europe, treated with MT, with or without intravenous tissue plasminogen activator (IVtPA), between September 2017 and July 2021. Among the 1568 patients, 347 (22.2%) experienced very poor outcomes (modified Rankin score (mRS), 5-6). Key predictors of poor outcomes were advanced age (odds ratio (OR): 1.03; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.02 to 1.04; p < 0.001), higher baseline National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores (OR: 1.07; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.10; p < 0.001), pre-operative glucose levels (OR: 1.01; 95% CI: 1.00 to 1.02; p < 0.001), and a baseline mRS of 4 (OR: 2.69; 95% CI: 1.25 to 5.82; p = 0.011). The multivariable model demonstrated good predictive accuracy with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.76. This study demonstrates that advanced age, higher NIHSS scores, elevated pre-stroke mRS, and pre-operative glucose levels significantly predict very poor outcomes in AIS-MeVO patients who received MT. These findings highlight the importance of a comprehensive risk assessment in primary MeVO patients for personalized treatment strategies. However, they also suggest a need for cautious patient selection for endovascular thrombectomy. Further prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore targeted therapeutic interventions.","2024","International journal of stroke : official journal of the International Stroke Society"

In our endeavor to develop precise, objective, and easily accessible diagnostic biomarkers for NSCLC, this study aimed to leverage rapidly evolving liquid biopsy techniques in the field of pathology to differentiate NSCLC patients from healthy controls by isolating peripheral blood samples and enriching extracellular vesicles (EVs) containing lung-derived proteins (thyroid transcription factor-1 [TTF-1] and surfactant protein B [SFTPB]), along with the cancer-associated protein CD151+ EVs. Additionally, for practical applications, we established a nano-flow cytometry assay to detect plasma EVs readily. NSCLC patients demonstrated significantly reduced counts of TTF-1+ EVs and CD151+ EVs in plasma compared with healthy controls (P < .0001), whereas SFTPB+ EVs showed no significant difference (P > .05). Integrated analysis of TTF-1+, CD151+, and SFTPB+ EVs yielded an area under the curve values of 0.913 and 0.854 in the discovery and validation cohorts, respectively. Thus, although further validation is essential, the newly developed technologies are of great significance for the robust detection of NSCLC biomarkers.","2024","Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology"

Monocentric, performed in CHU Bordeaux, Bordeaux, France. Retrospective case-control. 3 groups were included: KC group (108 eyes), FFKC (88 eyes), and normal corneas (162 eyes). The data were analyzed and processed using the Dataiku data science platform. Machine learning models (random forest [RF], logistic regression [LR]) were used to develop a multiclass classifier for automated early KC detection. The models were trained using a training database and tested using a test database. Then, algorithms were compared with the Ectasia Screening Index (ESI), which is an OCT-topography inherent screening score for ectasia. The LR and RF detected FFKC with an area under the curve of 0.99 and 0.98, respectively. The sensitivities of LR (100%) and RF (84%) were better than the ESI (28%) for the diagnosis of FFKC. However, ESI has a maximum specificity (100%) compared with the LR (100%) and 90% for RF.

In addition, sampling methods for a novel dual marker technique to characterize total GIT and post-ruminal permeability were validated. Six ruminally cannulated lactating Holstein cows were blocked by parity (3 primiparous, 3 multiparous; 189 DIM ± 25.2) and enrolled in a crossover design. Experimental periods included a 5-d baseline phase, 5-d challenge phase (CHAL), and 2 wk of recovery (REC1 and REC2). During CHAL, cows received either 100% ad libitum feed intake (AL) or 40% of ad libitum feed intake (FR). To assess total-tract and post-ruminal permeability, equimolar doses of Cr-EDTA and Co-EDTA were infused on d 3 of CHAL into the rumen and abomasum (0.369 mmol/kg BW). Following infusions, total urine and feces were collected every 8 h over 96 h, and blood samples were collected at h 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 32, 40, 48, and 64. The plasma area under the curve (AUC) for Cr and Co were calculated. By design, DMI for FR was reduced by 60% during CHAL and remained 19% lower than AL during REC1 but was not different from AL in REC2. Mean ruminal pH for FR was greatest during CHAL and least during REC1, with no differences detected between AL and FR in REC2. The duration that pH was <5.8 was least for FR during CHAL and greatest during REC1, which were different from AL and were no longer different between treatments in REC2. Milk yield was the least for FR during CHAL and REC1 and no longer different from AL in REC2. Feed restriction reduced milk fat, protein, and lactose yields by 26%, 31%, and 31%, respectively. Plasma Cr AUC was 34% greater and Co AUC tended to be 35% greater for FR than AL on d 3 of CHAL. Urinary Cr recovery after 48 h was not affected by treatment; however, urinary Co recovery was 36% greater for FR than AL. Positive correlations between plasma AUC and urinary recovery for Cr and Co were detected. It was determined that blood samples collected at h 2, 8, 20, 40, and 48 could predict the total plasma Cr and Co AUC within 1.9% and 6.2%, respectively. In summary, short-term FR in lactating dairy cows increases permeability of the total GIT and may increase permeability of the post-ruminal regions, with more than 60% of the permeability occurring post-ruminally. After FR, cows experienced low ruminal pH and a sustained reduction in milk yield. When using Cr- and Co-EDTA to evaluate regional GIT permeability, plasma AUC can be used as an alternative to urinary Cr and Co excretion. In addition, blood samples collected at h 2, 8, 20, 40, and 48 result in adequate prediction accuracy, at least when comparing GIT permeability for lactating dairy cows exposed to AL and FR.","2024","Journal of dairy science"

CGM (14-day recording duration) was performed on days 8, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 180 posttransplant. Eight patients (17%) developed PTDM and nine (20%) impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), as diagnosed by oral glucose tolerance test (oGTT)-derived 2-hour plasma glucose (2hPG) or glucose-lowering therapy on day 90. CGM-readouts percent of time >140 mg/dL (%TAR (140 mg/dL)) and percent of time >180 mg/dL (%TAR (180 mg/dL)) showed excellent in-sample test characteristics regarding PTDM from day 8 onward (days 8-90 receiver operating characteristic area under the curve: 0.88-0.99) and regarding PTDM/IGT with the commencement of maintenance immunosuppression from day 30 onward (days 30-90 receiver operating characteristic area under the curve: 0.88-0.91). Exploratory CGM-%TAR (140 mg/dL)-screening thresholds of 31.8% on day 8 and 13.2% on day 30 yielded sensitivities/specificities of 88%/83% for PTDM and 94%/78% for PTDM/IGT on day 90, respectively.

However, its role in diabetic retinopathy (DR) remains unclear. This study aims to elucidate the association between OA and DR and explore its potential in DR detection. We conducted a two-center, propensity score-matched case-control study, including 69 type 2 diabetes (T2D) patients with diagnosed DR (cases) and 69 matched T2D individuals without DR (control), in China from August 2017 to June 2018. Multiple logistic regression models analyzed the association between MUFAs and DR. The impact of 7 distinct MUFAs on DR was examined using elastic net regression (ENET), weighted quantile regression (WQS), and Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR), focusing on key lipid biomarkers. The diagnostic utility of these biomarkers was assessed by calculating the AUC. A significant negative correlation was found between MUFAs and DR, with OA identified as pivotal by ENET, WQS, and BKMR. The adjusted OR and 95% CI for DR were 0.25 (0.09, 0.69) for subjects in the 2nd tertile of OA and 0.11 (0.04, 0.30) for the 3rd tertile, compared to the lowest tertile. These results were consistent across subgroup and sensitivity analyses. The AUC (95% CI) for OA alone was 0.72 (0.63, 0.81), increasing to 0.77 (0.69, 0.85) when combined with other covariates. Our findings reveal a robust inverse relationship between plasma OA levels and DR risk, suggesting that OA could serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying type 2 diabetic patients with DR.","2024","Nutrition & metabolism"

In recent years, several studies have leveraged Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology to gauge an individual's mental state or level of depression. This study introduces a novel multi-tier ensemble learning approach to integrate multiple EEG bands for conducting mental state or depression assessments. Initially, the EEG signal is divided into eight sub-bands, and then a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is trained for each band. Subsequently, the integration of multi-band EEG frequency models and the evaluation of mental state or depression level are facilitated through a two-tier ensemble learning approach based on Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The authors conducted numerous experiments to validate the performance of the proposed method under different evaluation metrics. For clarity and conciseness, the research employs the simplest commercialized one-channel EEG sensor, positioned at FP1, to collect data from 57 subjects (49 depressed and 18 healthy subjects). The obtained results, including an accuracy of 0.897, F1-score of 0.921, precision of 0.935, negative predictive value of 0.829, recall of 0.908, specificity of 0.875, and AUC of 0.8917, provide evidence of the superior performance of the proposed method compared to other ensemble learning techniques.

To dissect how the DNA methylation heterogeneity in gliomas is influenced by the complex cellular composition of the tumour immune microenvironment, we first compared the DNA methylation profiles of purified human immune cells and bulk glioma tissue, stratifying three tumour immune microenvironmental subtypes for GBM and LGG samples from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). We found that more intermediate methylation sites were enriched in glioma tumour tissues, and used the Proportion of sites with Intermediate Methylation (PIM) to compare intertumoral DNA methylation heterogeneity. A larger PIM score reflected stronger DNA methylation heterogeneity. Enhanced DNA methylation heterogeneity was associated with stronger immune cell infiltration, better survival rates, and slower tumour progression in glioma patients. We then created a Cell-type-associated DNA Methylation Heterogeneity Contribution (CMHC) score to explore the impact of different immune cell types on heterogeneous CpG site (CpGct) in glioma tissues. We identified eight prognosis-related CpGct to construct a risk score: the Cell-type-associated DNA Methylation Heterogeneity Risk (CMHR) score. CMHR was positively correlated with cytotoxic T-lymphocyte infiltration (CTL), and showed better predictive performance for IDH status (AUC = 0.96) and glioma histological phenotype (AUC = 0.81).

Two observers assessed 14 MRI descriptors. ""Definite MD"" (2015 criteria) and ""all MD"" ears (wider clinical criteria) were compared to controls. Cohen's kappa and risk ratios (RR) were evaluated for each descriptor. Forward stepwise logistic regression established which combination of descriptors best predicted MD. The study included 132 patients (57 men; mean age 57.7 ± 13.6), with 87 ""all MD"" (56 ""definite"") and 39 control ears. The NSE sequence demonstrated increased perilymph SNR, and improved both diagnostic performance and reliability for 9/14 descriptors. However, ZPE demonstrated superior diagnostic performance for the best descriptor of ""saccule absent, large as or confluent with the utricle"" (RR 6.571, ZPE; 6.300, NSE) and that of ""asymmetric perilymphatic enhancement"" (RR 3.628, ZPE; 2.903, NSE). Both sequences combined these two descriptors in the optimal predictive model for ""definite MD"", with ""grade 2 cochlear hydrops"" also significant for NSE.

To identify the presence of scoliosis from surface data. Identifying AIS can be difficult. Screening is not universal for reasons including high false positive and negative rates. These difficulties can lead to some adolescents missing out on bracing. Logistic regression analysis of ISIS2 surface topography images only was performed. The x,y positions of the shoulders (Sh), axillae (Ax), waist (waist) and the x,y,z positions of the most prominent points over the posterior torso (scap) were used for the thoracic, thoracolumbar/lumbar and whole spine. The models were used to identify the presence of a 20-degree or larger scoliosis. Differences in the position of the landmarks were analyzed comparing left and right, with the suffix ""Ht"" representing a difference in the y coordinate, ""Off"" the x coordinate, and ""Depth,"" the z coordinate. Model accuracy was assessed as both percentages and ROC curves with the coefficients as odds ratios. There were 1283 images (1015 females and 268 males) all with a diagnosis of AIS. The models identified scoliosis in the thoracic spine with an 83% accuracy (AUC 0.91), thoracolumbar/lumbar spine with 74% accuracy (AUC 0.76), and whole spine with 80% accuracy (AUC 0.88). Significant parameters were AxDiffHt, AxDiffOff, WaistDiffHt, ScapDiffOff, and ScapDiffHt for the thoracic curves, AxDiffHt, AxDiffOff, WaistDiffHt for the thoracolumbar/lumbar curves, and AxDiffHt, AxDiffOff, WaistDiffHt and ScapDiffHt for the whole spine. The use of fixed anatomical points around the torso, analyzed using logistic regression, has a high accuracy for identifying curves in the thoracic, thoracolumbar/lumbar, and whole spines.

However, there is a lack of sufficient studies to explore the relationship between RBP4 and CKD, and no reports have described the predictive value of RBP4 for CKD. This study was designed to clarify the relationship between RBP4 and CKD and its potential predictive value. Our team has conducted a large-scale cross-sectional survey that contained 2117 individuals on the southern coast of China. Correlation test, logistic regression analysis were used to evaluate the association between RBP4 and CKD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were used to evaluate the optimal cut-off and predictive value of RBP4 for predicting CKD. By using the quartile grouping method, the population was divided into four groups according to the RBP4 level. As the RBP4 level increased, the prevalence of CKD also gradually increased among different groups. RBP4 was also correlated with various metabolic risk factors, such as blood glucose, blood lipids, blood pressure, waist circumference, uric acid, and with kidney function indicators such as creatinine, urine protein. Logistic regression analysis found that after adjusting for confounders, RBP4 remained significantly associated with CKD, independent of metabolic risk factors. ROC analysis showed that RBP4 as a single index, AUC (0.666) was superior to Scr, FBG, Log HOMA-IR, WC, TG, VLDL-C, UA, HDL-C, LDL-C, and that combining RBP4 indicator and other common risk factors of CKD can improve the accuracy for predicting CKD. This study found that the RBP4 was strongly correlated with CKD, RBP4 may become a valuable marker and have strong power for predicting CKD.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

We identified 28 patients with recurrence and 128 without recurrence who underwent total parathyroidectomy with autotransplantation (tPTX + AT) at our institution between 2015 and 2022. The TPV and postoperative recurrence information of the patients were recorded. Within the intergroup comparison, data obtained from the recurrence and non-recurrence groups were evaluated using the t-test. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed according to the regression model to determine factors that were significant in predicting postoperative recurrence. The cutoff value of TPV was determined using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The mean TPV of recurrence and no-recurrence groups were 2.99 ± 1.52 cm3 and 1.73 ± 1.19 cm3, respectively (p = 0.007). In univariate analysis, female sex, total parathyroid volume > 1.99 cm3, serum PTH > 928.37 pg/mL and p > 1.59 mmol/L were independent factors for SHPT recurrence. In multivariable analysis, TPV > 1.99 cm3, serum parathyroid hormone (PTH) > 928.37 pg/mL and p > 1.59 mmol/L were independent factors for SHPT recurrence. The ability of TPV to distinguish between recurrence and non-recurrence was evaluated using the ROC curve. The cutoff value of TPV was estimated as 2.65 cm3. With this value, sensitivity was found as 60.70%, specificity was 89.80%, and AUC was 0.80 (p < 0.001, confidence interval =0.719-0.882). According to the data in this study, it can be said that TPV can be used to distinguish recurrence from no-recurrence. Most importantly, TPV can be used to identify SHPT recurrence.","2024","Annals of medicine"

CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CD19-CAR) T-cell therapy has emerged as a safe and effective treatment for B-cell lymphomas. We aimed to assess toxicity and efficacy of CD19-CAR T-cells in neurolymphomatosis. Neurolymphomatosis patients treated with CD19 CAR T-cells were retrospectively identified at Massachusetts General Hospital over a six-year period. Toxicities were graded according to the ASTCT classification, management, and response rates were recorded. Eleven neurolymphomatosis patients were identified with a median of 2 lines of PNS-directed treatments (range: 1-3) prior to receiving CD19-CAR T-cells. Neurolymphomatosis localized to the nerve roots (8/11, 73%), plexus (5/11, 45%), peripheral (4/11, 36%) and cranial nerves (5/11, 45%). Low grade cytokine release syndrome (CRS) was detected in 8/11 (73%; grade 1: N = 7; grade 2: N = 1) cases. Low- and high-grade immune cell-associated neurotoxicity syndrome (ICANS) were recorded in 5/11 (45%; grade 1: N = 4; grade 2: N = 1) and 1/11 (9%; grade 4) patients, respectively. CRP levels at infusion were predictive of ICANS (area under the curve: 0.96, p = 0.01). Seven of eleven neurolymphomatosis patients (64%) responded to CD19-CAR T-cells. Complete remissions (CR) were achieved in three cases (27%), with 2 patients in sustained CR nine and 46 months after CD19-CAR infusion. Median progression-free survival (PFS) was 4 months. Collectively, CD19-CAR T-cell treatment was well tolerated and showed promising efficacy in recurrent neurolymphomatosis, a difficult to treat condition with unmet medical need. Findings suggest that CD19-CAR may sufficiently penetrate the blood-nerve barrier. Toxicity and outcomes were overall similar to CAR-T cell therapy in CNS lymphoma.","2024","American journal of hematology"

Data from 1539 adult chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) patients who underwent paranasal sinus computed tomography (CT) were collected. The overall dataset consisted of 254 MFB cases and 1285 non-MFB cases. The CT images were constructed and labeled to form the deep learning models. Seventy percent of the images were used for training the deep-learning models, and 30% were used for testing. Whole image analysis and instance segmentation analysis were performed using three different architectures: MobileNetv3, ResNet50, and ResNet101 for whole image analysis, and YOLOv5X-SEG, YOLOv8X-SEG, and YOLOv9-C-SEG for instance segmentation analysis. The ROC curve was assessed. Accuracy, sensitivity (recall), specificity, precision, and F1-score were compared between the models and a rhinologist. Kappa agreement was evaluated. Whole image analysis showed lower precision, recall, and F1-score compared to instance segmentation. The models exhibited an area under the ROC curve of 0.86 for whole image analysis and 0.88 for instance segmentation. In the testing dataset for whole images, the MobileNet V3 model showed 81.00% accuracy, 47.40% sensitivity, 87.90% specificity, 66.80% precision, and a 67.20% F1 score.

This study aimed to develop and validate a computed tomography (CT)-based, fully automated preoperative artificial intelligence (AI) model to predict EPNI in patients with PDAC. The authors retrospectively enrolled 1065 patients from two Shanghai hospitals between June 2014 and April 2023. Patients were split into training (n=497), internal validation (n=212), internal test (n=180), and external test (n=176) sets. The AI model used perivascular space and tumor contact for EPNI detection. The authors evaluated the AI model's performance based on its discrimination. Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, and Cox regression were used for survival analysis. The AI model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance for EPNI with 1-pixel expansion. The area under the curve in the training, validation, internal test, and external test sets were 0.87, 0.88, 0.82, and 0.83, respectively. The log-rank test revealed a significantly longer survival in the AI-predicted EPNI-negative group than the AI-predicted EPNI-positive group in the training, validation, and internal test sets (P<0.05). Moreover, the AI model exhibited exceptional prognostic stratification in early PDAC and improved assessment of neoadjuvant therapy's effectiveness. The AI model presents a robust modality for EPNI diagnosis, risk stratification, and neoadjuvant treatment guidance in PDAC, and can be applied to guide personalized precision therapy.","2024","International journal of surgery (London, England)"

However, the definition of BS remains subjective. Thus, we aim to propose the retrosternal angle (RSA) as a diagnostic measure for the discrimination of BS. Retrospective analysis of a cohort of patients who underwent a minimally invasive repair of pectus excavatum (MIRPE) between October 2016 and October 2023 at our Pectus Clinic. Five expert thoracic surgeons individually reviewed their medical photographs and chest CT scans assigning patients to BS or non-BS groups based on consensus (≥4 surgeons). RSA measurements were obtained by an independent thoracic surgeon. Among 283 cases analyzed, 50 (18%) were classified as BS and 233 (82%) as non-BS. No significant differences were found between groups in age (p = 0.62), Haller index (p = 0.11), or Correction index (p = 0.58). However, RSA was significantly lower in the BS group (141.2 ± 8.4° vs. 154.5 ± 10.3°, p < 0.0001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed RSA as a reliable predictor of BS (AUC 0.85, p < 0.0001), with a threshold of 148.5° demonstrating 80% sensitivity and 77% specificity. Regarding potential clinical implications, 26/50 (52%) of patients defined as BS underwent bar crossing, compared with 45/232 (19%) of those not considered a BS (p < 0.0001). This study proposes an objective metric, the Retrosternal Angle, to assess BS in chest CT scans, with a threshold of 148.5° showing high sensitivity and specificity. External validation of this angle and threshold is warranted in future investigations. Retrospective comparative study. III.","2024","Journal of pediatric surgery"

To address this challenge, focus is put on medical and operational efficiency improvements. This includes an increased use of machine learning (ML) to predict duration of surgery (DOS) and length of stay (LOS) for total knee and total hip arthroplasty, which can be utilized for optimizing resource allocation to satisfy medical and operational limitations. This paper explores the development and performance of ML models in predicting DOS and LOS. A systematic search of publications between 2010-2023 was conducted following PRISMA guidelines. Considering the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 28 out of 722 gathered papers from PubMed, Web of Science, and manual search were included in the study. Descriptive statistics was used to analyze the extracted data regarding data preprocessing, model development, and model performance assessment. Most of the papers work on LOS as a binary variable. Patient's age was identified as the most frequently used and reported as important variable for predicting DOS and LOS. Investigations also illustrated that within the resulting 28 papers, more than 71% of models reached good to perfect performance based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), where artificial neural networks and ensemble learning models had the biggest share among the best-performing models. The utilization of ML models is increasing in the literature. The current performance level indicates that ML can potentially turn to powerful tools in predicting DOS and LOS for different purposes. Meanwhile, the literature is not matured yet in reporting real-life application. Future studies can focus on model specification and validation by considering empirical application.","2024","International journal of medical informatics"

However, the relationship between LAR and mortality in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) remains unclear. We aim to evaluate the predictive value of LAR for ARDS patients. A retrospective cohort study. Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV (v2.2) database. 769 patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome(ARDS). We divided the patients into two subgroups according to the primary study endpoint (28-days all-cause mortality): the 28-day survivors and the 28-day non-survivors. Multivariate Cox Regression, Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis were used to investigate the relationship between LAR and short-time mortality in patients with ARDS. The 28-day mortality was 38 % in this study. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that LAR was an independent predictive factor for 28-day mortality (HR 1.11, 95 %CI: 1.06-1.16, P < 0.001). The area under curve (AUC) of LAR in the ROC was 70.34 % (95 %CI: 66.53 % - 74.15 %) that provided significantly higher discrimination compared with lactate (AUC = 68.00 %, P = 0.0007) or albumin (AUC = 63.17 %, P = 0.002) alone. LAR was also not inferior to SAPSII with the AUC of 73.44 % (95 %CI: 69.84 % - 77.04 %, P = 0.21). Additionally, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis displayed that ARDS patients with high LAR (> the cut-off value 0.9055) had a significantly higher 28-day overall mortality rate (P < 0.001) and in-hospital mortality rate (P < 0.001). However, patients in high LAR group had shorter length of hospital stay (P < 0.001), which might be caused by higher in-hospital mortality. We confirmed that there was a positive correlation between LAR and 28-day mortality. This could provide anesthesiologists and critical care physicians with a more convenient tool than SAPSII without being superior for detecting ARDS patients with poor prognosis timely.","2024","Journal of clinical anesthesia"

Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were employed to assess the risk imparted by anti-prothrombin antibodies, while ROC analysis was used to determine their sensitivity and specificity. Our study revealed that women with RPL had significantly higher serum levels of anti-prothrombin IgM and IgG than controls. Univariate regression analysis demonstrated that elevated anti-prothrombin IgM (OR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.07, 1.19; P < 0.001) and IgG (OR = 1.05; 95% CI = 1.03, 1.08; P < 0.001) were associated with increased RPL risk. Multivariate analysis confirmed these findings, indicating that anti-prothrombin IgM (aOR = 1.13; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.20; P < 0.001) and IgG (aOR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.05, 1.11; P < 0.001) are independent risk factors. ROC analysis yielded an AUC of 0.720 for IgM and 0.649 for IgG, underscoring their predictive value and offering hope for improved risk assessment and management of RPL. Elevated levels of anti-prothrombin IgM and IgG are significantly associated with RPL, suggesting an autoimmune component to pregnancy loss.

Four machine learning methods, including logistic regression (LR), random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), were employed to develop radiomics deep learning signatures. The clinical-radiomics model (Clinic + Rad), clinical-deep learning model (Clinic + DL), and clinical-radiomics-deep learning model (Clinic + Rad + DL) were developed by integrating radiomics deep learning signatures with clinical variables. The best model, integrated into a nomogram for clinical application, was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Among the four machine learning methods, XGBoost demonstrated superior performance in our patient dataset: radiomic (Rad) model (AUC, 0.786) and deep learning (DL) model (AUC, 0.803). Clinical variables such as age at onset and JIC classification were associated with early femoral head deformity (p < 0.05).

Furthermore, the invasive hemodynamic underpinnings of exercise limitations have not been thoroughly investigated. This is a retrospective analysis of 55 adults (age ≥18 years) with prior Fontan palliation who underwent treadmill CPET before invasive exercise hemodynamic testing using a supine cycle protocol between November 2018 and April 2023. The median age was 32.2 (IQR 24.1; 37.2) years. The peak heart rate (HR) was 139.7 ± 28.1 beats per minute and the peak oxygen consumption (VO2) was 19.1 ± 5.7 ml/kg/min (47.4 ± 13.5% predicted). VO2/HR was directly related to exercise stroke volume index (r = 0.50, p = 0.0002), whereas no association was seen with exercise arterio-mixed venous O2 content difference (r = 0.14, p = 0.32). Peak HR was inversely related to exercise pulmonary artery (PA) pressures (r = -0.61, p <0.0001) and PA wedge pressures (PAWP) (r = -0.61, p <0.0001). Moreover, %predicted VO2 was inversely related to exercise PA pressures (r = -0.50, p <0.0001) and PAWP (r = -0.55, p <0.0001). Peak VO2 ≤19.1 ml/kg/min had a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 76% (area under the curve 0.82) for predicting a ΔPAWP/ΔQs ratio >2 mmHg/L/min and/or a ΔPA/ΔQp >3 mmHg/L/min, whereas a predicted peak VO2 ≤48% had a sensitivity of 74% and a specificity of 81% (area under the curve 0.79) for the same parameters. In summary, lower peak HR and peak VO2 were associated with higher exercise PAWP and PA pressure. Peak VO2 ≤48% predicted provided the optimal cutoff for predicting increased indexed exercise PAWP or PA pressures; therefore, low peak VO2 should alert clinicians of abnormal underlying hemodynamics.","2024","The American journal of cardiology"

Secondary measures included the cough decibel level, semiquantitative cough intensity scores, and white card test results recorded prior to extubation. A total of 71 patients were included, 55 patients were in the extubation success group and 16 in the failure group. The mean age was 78(71,83) years, mainly male (73.2 %). Despite the baseline characteristics being mostly consistent across both groups, significant differences were noted in duration of mechanical ventilation, and intensive care units and hospital stay. Remarkably, the cough decibel was substantially lower in the extubation failure group compared to the other group (78.69 ± 8.23 vs 92.28 ± 7.01 dB). The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis revealed that a cough decibel below 85.77 dB is the optimal threshold for predicting extubation failure, exhibiting an 80 % sensitivity and 91.67 % specificity. The study corroborates that the cough decibel level serves as a quantifiable metric in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. It posits that the likelihood of extubation failure escalates when the cough decibel falls below 85.77 dB.

The cohort was randomly divided into training (n = 360) and validation (n = 240) groups at 6:4 ratios by R software. Clinical parameters and radiographic features were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression to construct a predictive nomogram for post-endoscopic TSS DI risk. Model performance was assessed using ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Subgroup analysis was used to evaluate the model's ability to discriminate between transient and permanent DI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses on the training group identified several independent risk factors for post-endoscopic TSS DI, including maximum tumor diameter, Knosp grade, Esposito grade, recurrent PA, and pituitary stalk deviation angle. A nomogram was developed based on these factors, demonstrating robust predictive accuracy with ROC areas under curve of 0.840 for the training group and 0.815 for the validation group. Calibration plots indicated excellent agreement between predicted and observed probabilities of postoperative DI. DCA curves highlighted the nomogram's efficacy in guiding clinical decision-making.

This retrospective study evaluated 118 patients with breast cancer, including 33 (28.0%) with biopsy-LPBC, 52 (44.1%) with TILs-US score-high, with 34 (28.8%) achieving pCR. The sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and AUC for predicting pCR were 0.53, 0.82, 2.96, 0.57, and 0.68, respectively, for biopsy-LPBC, and 0.76, 0.69, 2.47, 0.34, and 0.73, respectively, for TILs-US score. The biopsy-LPBC nomogram showed significant improvements in categorical NRI (p = 0.023) and IDI (p = 0.007) but not in AUC (p = 0.25), compared with the basic nomogram. The TILs-US nomogram exhibited significant improvements in AUC (p = 0.039), categorical NRI (p = 0.010), and IDI (p < 0.001). The TILs-US score may serve as a novel marker for prediction of pCR in patients with breast cancer.

Due to the constant changes in treatment methods, it is essential to perform temporal validation with a recent patient population. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to validate the Skeletal Oncology Research Group machine learning algorithms (SORG-MLA) using a contemporary patient cohort. This retrospective cohort study investigated patients who received surgical treatment for spinal metastases between January 2017 and July 2021 in two tertiary care centers in the US. Eighteen input variables needed for the SORG-MLA were collected including primary tumor, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status, and nine preoperative laboratory values. Outcomes were defined as mortality at 90-day and 1-year postoperative. Performance was assessed using calibration, discrimination, overall performance, and decision curve analysis. In total, 464 patients were included. The validation cohort varied from the development cohort in multiple variables. Despite these differences, the SORG-MLA continued to perform well on calibration, discrimination (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.81 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.77-0.86) for 90-day, AUC 0.75 (95% CI, 0.71-0.80) for 1-year), Brier score, and decision curve analyses. In spite of recent progress in treating spinal metastases, SORG-MLA for survival in patients with spinal metastatic disease continued to perform well on temporal validation. However, updating the models using a contemporary patient cohort and stratifying by primary tumor could further improve the performance.","2024","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society"

Few prediction models of BS are available and some factors such as frailty and intraoperative hypotension (IOH) which have been reported to promote the occurrence of BS were not included. Therefore, we look forward to creating a straightforward, precise, and clinically useful prediction model by incorporating new factors, such as frailty and IOH. We retrospectively collected 540 patients and analyzed the data from 418 patients. Univariate analysis and backward stepwise logistic regression were used to select risk factors to develop a dynamic nomogram model, and then we developed a web calculator to visualize the process of prediction. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated in terms of discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the nomogram showed good discriminative ability (AUC = 0.933) and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test demonstrated the nomogram had good calibration (p = 0.0718). Age, Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) score, midazolam dose, propofol induction dose, total area under the hypotensive threshold of mean arterial pressure (MAP_AUT), and cerebrovascular diseases were the independent risk predictors of BS and used to construct nomogram. The web-based dynamic nomogram calculator was accessible by clicking on the URL: https://eegbsnomogram.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/ or scanning a converted Quick Response (QR) code. Incorporating two distinctive new risk factors, frailty and IOH, we firstly developed a visualized nomogram for accurately predicting BS in non-cardiac surgery patients.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.","Calprotectin is a protein endowed with antimicrobial properties, rendering it a distinctive marker for infection. Two methods are currently available for the assay of calprotectin: the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and the lateral flow test (LFT). We aimed to assess the diagnostic accuracy of synovial fluid calprotectin and to compare the accuracy of the laboratory-based test and the qualitative assessment for the diagnosis of hip and knee prosthetic infection. We searched (from inception to November 2023) MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, Web of Science, and Cochrane for studies on calprotectin in the diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative likelihood ratio (LR), and diagnostic odds ratio were analyzed. The receiver-operating curve for each method was calculated. We included 14 articles in our meta-analysis, including 902 patients who underwent total hip and knee arthroplasties revision; 331 (37%) had a joint infection according to MSIS, MSIS-modified criteria, ICM 2018 and EBJIS 2021. Considering the false-positive result rate of 6% and false-negative result rate of 7%, pooled sensitivity and specificity were 0.92 (95% CI 0.89-0.94) and 0.93 (0.91-0.95), respectively. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.93 (95% CI 0.91-0.94). No statistical differences in terms of sensitivity and specificity were found between ELISA and LFT. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of the two calprotectin assessment methods were: LFT 0.90 (95% CI 0.869-0.935) and 0.92 (95% CI 0.894-0.941), respectively; ELISA 0.96 (95% CI 0.914-0.986) and 0.97 (95% CI 0.934-0.988), respectively. The diagnostic odds ratio of the ELISA was superior to that of the LFT (906.6667, 95% CI 271.2686-3030.3712 versus 113.8886, 95% CI 70.4001-184.2414; p < 0.001). The AUC for ELISA and LFT was 0.968 (95% CI 0.944-0.984) and 0.915 (95% CI 0.895-0.933), respectively. Detection of synovial calprotectin is an accurate test for diagnosis of hip and knee prosthetic infections. The diagnostic accuracy of the two calprotectin assessment methods is almost comparable.

To identify high-risk subregions associated with synchronous distant metastasis. This study enrolled a total of 277 patients with ccRCC. Voxel intensity and local entropy values were compiled within the region of interest for all patients. Unsupervised k-means clustering yielded three subregions per tumor. Radiomic features were extracted, and random forest-based feature selection was conducted. The selected features were used in a multi-instance support vector machine (mi-SVM) model for training, and predictions were made on the validation cohort. Model performance was evaluated using five-fold cross-validation. The subregion with the highest score for patients with synchronous distant metastasis was identified across all cohorts. The mi-SVM model yielded an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.812 in the training cohort and 0.805 in the validation cohort. In the entire cohort of patients with synchronous distant metastasis, subregion 2, characterized by tumor periphery and intratumoral transitional components, accounted for the highest proportion (48.57%, 30.6/63) among all subregions. It represents a high-risk subregion for synchronous distant metastasis of clear cell renal cell carcinoma.

A total of 105 non-enhancing gliomas were studied. T2-FLAIR digital subtraction maps were used to identify T2FM and T2-FLAIR non-mismatch (T2FNM) subregions within tumor volumes of interest (VOIs). Median nADC from the whole tumor, T2FM, and T2NFM subregions and %T2FM-volume were obtained. IDHm-A classification analyses using receiver-operating characteristic curves and multiple logistic regression were performed in addition to exploratory survival analyses. T2FM subregions had significantly higher nADC than T2FNM subregions within IDHm-A with ≥ 25% T2FM-volume (P < 0.0001). IDHm-A with ≥ 25% T2FM-volume demonstrated significantly higher whole tumor nADC compared to IDHm-A with < 25% T2FM-volume (P < 0.0001), and both IDHm-A subgroups demonstrated significantly higher nADC compared to IDH-mutant oligodendroglioma and IDH-wild-type gliomas (P < 0.05). For classification of IDHm-A vs. other gliomas, the area under curve (AUC) of nADC was significantly greater compared to the AUC of %T2FM-volume (P = 0.01, nADC AUC = 0.848, %T2FM-volume AUC = 0.714) along with greater sensitivity. In exploratory survival analyses within IDHm-A, %T2FM-volume was not associated with overall survival (P = 0.2), but there were non-significant trends for nADC (P = 0.07) and tumor volume (P = 0.051). T2-FLAIR subtraction maps are useful for characterizing IDHm-A imaging characteristics. nADC outperforms %T2FM-volume for classifying IDHm-A amongst non-enhancing gliomas with preserved high specificity and increased sensitivity, which may be related to inherent diffusivity differences regardless of T2FM.

249,"39312593","Radiomic detection of abnormal brain regions in tuberous sclerosis complex.","Radiomics refers to the extraction of quantitative information from medical images and is most commonly utilized in oncology to provide ancillary information for solid tumor diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment response. The traditional radiomic pipeline involves segmentation of volumes of interest with comparison to normal brain. In other neurologic disorders, such as epilepsy, lesion delineation may be difficult or impossible due to poor anatomic definition, small size, and multifocal or diffuse distribution. Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disease in which brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrates multifocal abnormalities with variable imaging and epileptogenic features. The purpose of this study was to develop a radiomic workflow for identification of abnormal brain regions in TSC, using a whole-brain atlas-based approach with generation of heatmaps based on signal deviation from normal controls. This was a retrospective pilot study utilizing high-resolution whole-brain 3D FLAIR MRI datasets from retrospective enrollment of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) patients and normal controls. Subjects underwent MRI including high-resolution 3D FLAIR sequences. Preprocessing included skull stripping, coregistration, and intensity normalization. Using the Brainnetome and Harvard-Oxford atlases, brain regions were parcellated into 318 discrete regions. Expert neuroradiologists spatially labeled all tubers in TSC patients using ITK-SNAP. The pyradiomics toolbox was used to extract 88 radiomic features based on IBSI guidelines, comparing tuber-affected and non-tuber-affected parenchyma in TSC patients, as well as normal brain tissue in control patients. For model training and validation, regions with tubers from 20 TSC patients and 30 normal control subjects were randomly divided into two training sets (80%) and two validation sets (20%). Additional model testing was performed on a separate group of 20 healthy controls. LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) was used to perform variable selection and regularization to identify regions containing tubers. Relevant radiomic features selected by LASSO were combined to produce a radiomic score ω, defined as the sum of squared differences from average control group values. Region-specific ω scores were converted to heat maps and spatially coregistered with brain MRI to reflect overall radiomic deviation from normal. The proposed radiomic workflow allows for quantification of deviation from normal in 318 regions of the brain with the use of a summative radiomic score ω. This score can be used to generate spatially registered heatmaps to identify brain regions with radiomic abnormalities. The pilot study of TSC showed radiomic scores ω that were statistically different in regions containing tubers from regions without tubers/normal brain (p < 0.0001). Our model exhibits an AUC of 0.81 (95% confidence interval: 0.78-0.84) on the testing set, and the best threshold obtained on the training set, when applied to the testing set, allows us to identify regions with tubers with a specificity of 0.91 and a sensitivity of 0.60. We describe a whole-brain atlas-based radiomic approach to identify abnormal brain regions in TSC patients. This approach may be helpful for identifying specific regions of interest based on relatively greater signal deviation, particularly in clinical scenarios with numerous or poorly defined anatomic lesions.","2024","Medical physics"

However, personalizing treatment options between these treatment modalities is challenging due to unclear criteria. We developed an artificial intelligence (AI)-based model that can identify patients with localized PCa who would benefit more from either radiotherapy or surgery, thereby providing personalized clinical decision-making. Data from consecutive patients with localized PCa who received radiotherapy or surgery with complete records of clinicopathological variables and follow-up results in 12 registries of the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database were analyzed. Patients from 7 registries were randomly assigned to training (TD) and internal validation datasets (IVD) at a 9:1 ratio. The remaining 5 registries constituted the external validation dataset (EVD). TD was divided into training-radiotherapy (TRD) and training-surgery (TSD) datasets, and IVD was divided into internal-radiotherapy (IRD) and internal-surgery (ISD) datasets. Six models for radiotherapy and surgery were trained using TRD and TSD to predict radiotherapy survival probability (RSP) and surgery survival probability (SSP), respectively. The models with the highest concordance index (C-index) on IRD and ISD were chosen to form the final treatment recommendation model (FTR). FTR recommendations were based on the higher value between RSP and SSP. Kaplan-Meier curves were generated for patients receiving recommended (consistent group) and nonrecommended treatments (inconsistent group), which were compared using the log-rank test. The study included 118 236 patients, categorized into TD (TRD: 44 621; TSD: 41 500), IVD (IRD: 4949; ISD: 4621), and EVD (22 545). Both radiotherapy and surgery models accurately predicted RSP and SSP (C-index: 0.735-0.787 and 0.769-0.797, respectively). The consistent group exhibited higher survival rates than the inconsistent group, particularly among patients not suitable for active surveillance (P < .001). FTR accurately identifies patients with localized PCa who would benefit more from either radiotherapy or surgery, offering clinicians an effective AI tool to make informed choices between these 2 treatments.","2024","The oncologist"

This study aims to compare the accuracy of different ML techniques in predicting OSA severity and identify key associated factors contributing to OSA. Adult patients suspected of OSA underwent clinical assessments and polysomnography. Demographic, anthropometric and clinical data were collected. Five supervised ML models (logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, support vector machine) were employed, optimized through grid search and cross-validation. ML models exhibited varied performance across OSA severity levels. SVM demonstrated the highest accuracy for mild OSA, XGBoost for moderate OSA, and random forest for severe OSA. Logistic regression showed the highest AUC for moderate and severe OSA. Anthropometric measures, gender, and hypertension were significant predictors of OSA severity. ML models offer valuable insights into predicting OSA severity and identifying associated factors. Our findings support the relevant potential clinical utility of ML in OSA management, although further validation and refinement are warranted.","2024","Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung"

Blinded radiologic review of imaging studies, including measurement of maximum standardized uptake values (SUVmax) of the ipsilateral side of concern and contralateral side. Retrospective medical record review for associated clinical data. The primary study outcome was the incidence of oropharynx cancer diagnosis in patients with asymmetric oropharynx PET uptake. The primary outcome was formulated before data collection. Of the 1854 patients identified with asymmetric oropharynx PET uptake, 327 (17.6%) met inclusion criteria. Of these, 173 (52.9%) were male, and the median (range) age was 65.0 (24.8-90.7) years. The mean (SD) follow-up interval was 52.1 (43.4) months. A total of 18 of 327 patients (5.5%) were newly diagnosed with oropharynx cancer. The most common diagnosis was squamous cell carcinoma (n = 9), followed by lymphoma (n = 8), and sarcoma (n = 1). Patients with an incidental diagnosis of oropharynx cancer had higher mean (SD) ipsilateral SUVmax (8.7 [3.7] vs 5.3 [1.9]) and SUVmax ratio (3.0 [1.6] vs 1.6 [0.6]) compared with patients with normal examination findings. SUVmax ratio and difference were found to be good discriminators of oropharynx cancer, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 86.3% (95% CI, 76.4-94.6) and 85.8% (95% CI, 74.8-94.6), respectively. Patients with a new diagnosis of oropharynx cancer were more likely to have a corresponding CT abnormality than those with normal examination findings (6 of 18 [33%] vs 24 of 295 [8.1%]). Patients with concerning lesions on oropharynx palpation by an otolaryngology health care professional were significantly more likely to be diagnosed with oropharynx cancer compared with patients with normal examination findings (odds ratio, 28.4; 95% CI, 6.6-145.8). In this cohort study, while incidental asymmetric oropharynx PET uptake was common, a new diagnosis of oropharynx cancer was not and potentially results in a large volume of unnecessary referrals and work-up. Using SUVmax ratio, SUVmax difference, and CT correlation may increase the benefit of referral. Patients with a palpable oropharynx lesion and asymmetric oropharynx PET uptake should undergo confirmatory biopsy.","2024","JAMA otolaryngology-- head & neck surgery"

We calculated the rate of POPF (ISGPS 2016 definition, grade B/C) by analyzing consecutive patients after RPD by surgeons after their learning curves (80 RPDs per surgeon). The validation of the ISGPS 4-tier and the simplified 3-tier risk classification was conducted using the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). From 2019 to 2023, 187 patients after RPD were included. Neither the ISGPS 4-tier nor the simplified 3-tier classification model showed robust discrimination (AUC: 0.696 and 0.685, respectively). Moreover, both risk classifications failed to differentiate the rates of POPF and major complications among subgroups. Multivariate analysis suggested that soft pancreatic texture and pancreatic duct ≤ 2 mm were independent risk factors for POPF after RPD. After adjusting the duct size's cutoff from 3 to 2 mm, the revised 4-tier ""2 mm"" classification model showed no significant difference between risk categories B and C (6.7% vs. 9.4%, P = 0.063). The revised 3-tier ""2 mm"" classification model stratified patients into A (n = 54), B (n = 68), and C (n = 65) groups, with corresponding POPF rates of 0.0%, 8.8%, and 23.1% (P < 0.001), and major complication rates of 5.6, 14.7, and 24.6% (P = 0.014), respectively.

A total of 148 women, including 50 patients with biochemical POI (bPOI) (10 IU/L < follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) ≤ 25 IU/L), 46 patients with POI (25 IU/L<FSH ≤ 40 IU/L) and 52 age-matched control women with normal ovarian reserve were involved in this study. FF and paired serum were collected from these women. IL-33 and sST2 were measured using quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. FF IL-33 levels were significantly increased in bPOI and POI patients compared to controls. They exhibited positive associations with FSH and luteinizing hormone (LH), whereas negative correlations with anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH), estradiol (E2), testosterone (T) and antral follicle count (AFC). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that for POI prediction, FF IL-33 had a better predictive accuracy (AUC 0.901) with high sensitivity (82.61%) and good specificity (84.62%) than those for bPOI prediction. IL-33 levels in paired serum did not differ among three groups. Regarding sST2, its levels in FF declined with POI progression. Contrarily, they showed negative associations with FSH and LH, but positive correlations with AMH, E2, T and AFC. ROC analysis revealed that FF sST2 had comparatively weak potentials for both bPOI and POI prediction compared to those of FF IL-33. Similarly, there was no significant alteration of sST2 in paired serum among three groups. Additionally, Spearman's correlation analysis revealed that FF IL-33 levels were negatively associated with the rates of Day-3 good-quality embryos (r=-0.206, P=0.012), whereas FF sST2 did not. Our study revealed an increased abundance of FF IL-33, whereas an sST2 deficiency with POI development. This implies that IL-33 and sST2 levels might be associated with the development of POI.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

For a long time, the success of the abdominal wall reconstruction (AWR) was measured only from the surgeon's perspective by defining outcome measures such as wound morbidity and recurrence. The understanding that complete recovery is difficult to assess without considering patients has shifted the paradigm of optimal outcomes to Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMS) and Quality of Life (QoL), which are pivotal to evaluate the success and efficacy of AWR. We conducted a prospective follow-up study of 91 patients undergoing mesh-augmented abdominal wall reconstruction for primary or recurrent incisional hernia between January 2021 and December 2023. Demographic data, comorbidities, and hernia characteristics were recorded. All patients were evaluated preoperatively by a native abdomino-pelvic CT scan to assess the characteristics of hernia (length, width, surface, and volume of the incisional hernia sac and of peritoneal cavity), the presence of mesh (if previously inserted), and abdominal wall muscles status. All intervention were performed by the same surgical team according to the techniques described by Rives - Stoppa (RS), Ramirez (ACS), and Novitsky (PCS). Abdominal wall function was assessed using trunk raising (TR) and double leg lowering (DLL) measurements performed preoperatively, 1 month, 6 months, and 1 year postoperatively. At the same time, pre- and post-operative quality of life was analysed using the EQ-5D score. Mean age of 59.42 ± 12.28 years and a male/female ratio of 35/56 were recorded, most of them being obese. There were 36 (42%) patients with defects larger than 10 cm. The distribution of the type of surgical intervention was: RS 35 patients, ACS 13 patients, and PCS 43 patients. The mean value of combined score for the preoperative abdominal wall functionality was 4.41 ± 1.67 (2-8) while the mean value of preoperative EQ-5D index was 0.652 ± 0.026 (-0.32-1.00). QoL was poor and very poor for 48% (44) of the patients who recorded index values less than 0.56 (50% percentile). Preoperative EQ-5D index was highly correlated with Combined AWF score (r = 0.620; p < 0.0001) and the correlation was specific (AUC = 0.799; p < 0.0001; asymptotic 95%CI = 0.711-0.923). At 12 months, the AWF score increased to 8.13 ± 2.58 (1-10) and the QoL total score to 0.979 ± 0.007 (0.71-1). Good and very good total scores for QoL were recorded for 47 patients (84%) compared to 33 (36%) in the preoperative evaluation (χ2 with Yates continuity correction for two degrees of liberty = 46.04; p < 0.00001). Our results suggest that patients can expect to see a significant overall improvement in all five components of QoL measured with the help of Eq. 5D questionnaire. This improvement is dependent by hernia size, and some individual patient's factors (diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and age over 60 years).","2024","Hernia : the journal of hernias and abdominal wall surgery"

Six hundred and sixty cases of craniopharyngioma (training cohort: n = 462; validation cohort: n = 198) were retrospectively reviewed between October 2018 and May 2024, and relevant risk factors were identified. A nomogram was built using a stepwise logistic regression method based on the Akaike information criterion. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis. The overall rate of postoperative CSF leak was 4.5%. Higher prognostic nutritional index (PNI) level (OR 0.819, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.735-0.912; p < 0.001) and larger dural defect (OR 6.789, 95% CI 3.112-14.807; p < 0.001) were identified as independent predictors for postoperative CSF leak in multivariable logistic regression analysis. The AUCs of the nomogram were 0.870 (95% CI, 0.782-0.957; p < 0.001) and 0.842 (95% CI, 0.722-0.963; p < 0.001) in the training and validation sets, respectively. Calibration curves in the training and validation cohorts showed satisfactory agreement between predictive and actual outcomes (p = 0.608 and p = 0.564, respectively). Decision curve analysis further confirmed the clinical usefulness of the nomogram. Higher PNI levels may help reduce the risk of postoperative CSF leak, while a larger dural defect size was demonstrated as an independent risk factor. We developed and validated a nomogram for predicting CSF leak after endoscopic craniopharyngioma resection, which showed strong predictive performance and could assist clinicians in formulating personalized treatment strategies.","2024","Neurosurgical review"

A dataset of 1730 panoramic radiographs was collected; 1300 images were allocated to training and 430 to testing. The performance of the model was evaluated using the confusion matrix for multiclass classification, and the actual scores were compared to those of two human experts. The area under the precision-recall curve of the YOLOv5 model ranged from 72% to 89% across the variables in the surgical difficulty index. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed promising results of the YOLOv5 model for classifying third molars into three surgical difficulty levels (micro-average AUC 87%). Furthermore, the algorithm scores demonstrated good agreement with the human experts. In conclusion, the YOLOv5 model has the potential to accurately detect and classify the position of mandibular third molars, with high performance for every criterion in radiographic images. The proposed model could serve as an aid in improving clinician performance and could be integrated into a screening system.","2024","International journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery"

Combining computerized cognitive training (CCT) and functional skills training software (FUNSAT) produced improvements in 6 functional skills in MCI, with effect sizes >0.75. However, 4% of HC and 35% of MCI participants failed to master all 6 tasks. We address early identification of characteristics that identify participants who do not graduate, to improve later interventions. NC participants (n = 72) received FUNSAT and MCI (n = 92) participants received FUNSAT alone or combined FUNSAT and CCT on a fully remote basis. Participants trained twice a week for up to 12 weeks. Participants ""graduated"" each task when they made one or fewer errors on all 3-6 subtasks per task. Tasks were no longer trained after graduation. Between-group comparisons of graduation status on baseline completion time and errors found that failure to graduate was associated with more baseline errors on all tasks but no longer completion times. A discriminant analysis found that errors on the first task (Ticket purchase) uniquely separated the groups, F = 41.40, p < .001, correctly classifying 94% of graduators. An ROC analysis found an AUC of .83. MOCA scores did not increase classification accuracy. More baseline errors, but not completion times, predicted failure to master all FUNSAT tasks. Accuracy of identification of eventual mastery was exceptional. Detection of risk to fail to master training tasks is possible in the first 15 minutes of the baseline assessment. This information can guide future enhancements of computerized training.","2024","International psychogeriatrics"

This study aims to analyse two cohorts of high-risk pregnant women for APO to comprehend risk factors and improve prediction accuracy. We considered an LMIC and a high-income country (HIC) population to derive XGBoost classifiers to predict low birth weight (LBW) from a comprehensive set of maternal and fetal characteristics including socio-demographic, past and current pregnancy information, fetal biometry and fetoplacental Doppler measurements. Data were sourced from the FeDoC (Fetal Doppler Collaborative) study (Pakistan, LMIC) and theIMPACT (Improving Mothers for a Better PrenAtal Care Trial) study (Spain, HIC), and included 520 and 746 pregnancies assessed from 28 weeks gestation, respectively. The models were trained on varying subsets of the mentioned characteristics to evaluate their contribution in predicting LBW cases. For external validation, and to highlight potential differential risk factors for LBW, we investigated the generalisation of these models across cohorts. Models' performance was evaluated through the area under the curve (AUC), and their interpretability was assessed using SHapley Additive exPlanations. In FeDoC, Doppler variables demonstrated the highest value at predicting LBW compared with biometry and maternal clinical data (AUCDoppler, 0.67; AUCClinical, 0.65; AUCBiometry, 0.63), and its combination with maternal clinical data yielded the best prediction (AUCClinical+Doppler, 0.71). In IMPACT, fetal biometry emerged as the most predictive set (AUCBiometry, 0.75; AUCDoppler, 0.70; AUCClinical, 0.69) and its combination with Doppler and maternal clinical data achieved the highest accuracy (AUCClinical+Biometry+Doppler, 0.81). External validation consistently indicated that biometry combined with Doppler data yielded the best prediction. Our findings provide new insights into the predictive role of different clinical and ultrasound descriptors in two populations at high risk for APO, highlighting that different approaches are required for different populations. However, Doppler data improves prediction capabilities in both settings, underscoring the value of standardising ultrasound data acquisition, as practiced in HIC, to enhance LBW prediction in LMIC.

Although larger infarct sizes (IS) correlate with a higher risk of VF, the influence of VF itself on IS has remained poorly investigated. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed the effect of VF on IS in patients and two experimental models. From a prospective cohort, 30 STEMI patients with VF were matched 1:2 with STEMI patients without VF on the common determinants of IS. The primary endpoint was IS, assessed using the 48-h area under the curve (AUC) for troponin. We also compared IS in pigs with/without spontaneous VF during STEMI (n = 15/group), and in an isolated rat heart model of myocardial infarction with/without electrically induced VF (n = 7/group). After matching, the patient characteristics, including the area at risk (AR), were similar. IS was 33% lower in the VF group compared to the control group (troponin AUC 1.6 [0.5-3.3] 106 arbitrary units vs. 2.4 [0.9-4.1] 106 arbitrary units; p < 0.05), but infarct scar size (assessed using MRI and ECG) did not differ between the groups at 1 and 6 months. In both experimental models, IS, expressed as a percentage of AR, was lower (p < 0.05) in the VF group than in the control group. When common determinants of IS are comparable, VF occurring prior to myocardial infarction reperfusion appears to be associated with smaller IS. Nevertheless, this finding, observed under specific experimental conditions and in a highly selected group of patients, was not associated with reduced infarct scar size.Registration (HIBISCUS-STEMI cohort): ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05794022.","2024","Basic research in cardiology"

Thus, understanding the regional drivers and patterns of jellyfish occurrence is key for developing effective management strategies. The Portuguese man o' war (Physalia physalis) is a hazardous, cosmopolitan siphonophore of particular concern, requiring a deeper ecological understanding to effectively guide mitigation efforts. Our study reveals that the occurrence of P. physalis in both the North Atlantic (Azores, Portugal) and the Southeast Pacific (Australian East Coast) is driven by region-specific wind patterns and increased primary productivity (>30 % model contribution), with warming conditions emerging as an additional occurrence driver on the Australian East Coast (∼20 % model contribution). These insights resulted from machine learning models (Boosted Regression Trees) trained with high-resolution environmental data against field data describing the temporal variability of P. physalis occurrence (North Atlantic: 2008-2021; Southeast Pacific: 2016-2020). The models achieved excellent predictive performance (AUC North Atlantic: 1.00; AUC Southeast Pacific: 0.92) and allowed hindcasting occurrences over 30 years, uncovering contrasting trends between the two regions, with decadal fluctuations in the Azores and a significant increase in occurrence over time on the Australian East Coast. Overall, we provide a better understanding of the drivers and patterns of P. physalis occurrence, which can support the development of coastal management strategies. Importantly, the anticipated changes in productivity and temperature conditions in both regions may result in increased blooms in the years to come, further exerting impacts on the ecosystems, human health, and the economy.","2024","Marine pollution bulletin"

We estimate individuals' biological age based on biomarkers from multiple systems and validate it through its association with mortality from natural causes. Biological age was estimated in 12,109 participants (6621 women and 5488 men) from the first visit of the Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil) who had valid data for the biomarkers used in the analyses. Biological age was estimated using the Klemera and Doubal method. The difference between chronological age and biological age (Δage) was computed. Cox proportional hazard models stratified by sex were used to assess whether Δage was associated with mortality risk after a median follow-up of 9.1 years. The accuracy of the models was estimated by the area under the curve (AUC). Δage had equal mean for men and women, with greater variability for men. Cox models showed that every 1-year increase in Δage was associated with increased mortality in men (HR (95% CI) 1.21; 1.17-1.25) and women (HR (95% CI) 1.24; 1.15-1.34), independently of chronological age. Results of the AUC demonstrated that the predictive power of models that only included chronological age (AUC chronological age = 0.7396) or Δage (AUC Δage = 0.6842) was lower than those that included both, chronological age and Δage (AUC chronological age + Δage = 0.802), in men. This difference was not observed in women. We demonstrate that biological age is strongly related to mortality in both genders and is a valid predictor of death in Brazilian adults, especially among men.","2024","GeroScience"

Maternal characteristics and history, mean arterial pressure (MAP) measurement, uterine artery pulsatility index (UtA-PI) ultrasound, maternal ophthalmic peak ratio Doppler, and placental growth factor (PlGF) serum were collected during the visit. Stillbirth was classified as placental dysfunction-related when it occurred with pre-eclampsia or birth weight <10th percentile. Combined prediction models were developed from significant variables in stillbirths, placental dysfunction-related, and controls. We used the area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity based on a specific cutoff to evaluate the model's predictive performance by measuring the capacity to distinguish between stillbirths and live births. There were 13 (0.79%) cases of stillbirth in 1643 women included in the analysis. The combination of maternal factors, MAP, UtA-PI, and PlGF, significantly contributed to the prediction of stillbirth. This model was a good predictor for all (including controls) types of stillbirth (AUC 0.879, 95% CI: 0.799-0.959, sensitivity of 99.3%, specificity of 38.5%), and an excellent predictor for placental dysfunction-related stillbirth (AUC 0.984, 95% CI: 0.960-1.000, sensitivity of 98.5, specificity of 85.7).

However, total resection is usually challenging to obtain and has a strong possibility of causing various complications if forcibly attempted. Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) has become a necessary adjunctive tool for CMCET resection. The current study aimed to evaluate the application value of bulbocavernosus reflex (BCR) monitoring in CMCET surgery. A retrospective clinical study. The medical records of patients who underwent CMCET resection by the same neurosurgical team at our hospital from September 2020 to June 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. IONM was conducted in all surgeries. According to inclusion criteria and exclusion criteria, ultimately, 105 patients were enrolled in the study. The voiding function was assessed before surgery, 1 month after, and 6 months after surgery using the Neurogenic Bladder Symptom Score (NBSS). If the NBSS obtained 1 month after surgery exceeds 9 points than that before surgery, it can be considered that the patient suffered new-onset postoperative voiding dysfunctions (PVDs). Moreover, if the NBSS could restored (less than 9 points higher than before the surgery) at 6 months after surgery, it was defined as a short-term PVD. Otherwise, it was defined as a long-term PVD. The amplitude reduction ratios (ARRs) of bilateral BCR waveforms were calculated and compared between patients with PVDs and those without. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was subsequently applied to determine the cut-off value of the maximal and minimal ARRs for predicting PVDs. The maximal and minimal ARRs were significantly correlated with short-term and long-term PVDs (p<.001 for all comparisons, Mann-Whitney U test). The threshold values of maximal ARR for predicting short-term and long-term PVD were 68.80% (AUC=0.996, p<.001) and 72.10% (AUC=0.996, p<.001), respectively.

Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, chi-square test, Pearson correlation analysis, multivariate logistic regression analysis, decision curve analysis (DCA), receiver operating characteristic curves (ROCs). The significance threshold was set at P < 0.05. Correlation analysis revealed that APTw and NIHSS exhibit the highest correlation (r = -0.634, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.418 to -0.782), surpassing that of ADC and lesion size. Multivariable analysis revealed APTw (odds ratio [OR] 0.905, 95% CI 0.845-0.970), ADC (OR 0.745, 95% CI 0.609-0.911), and infarct core-cerebral blood volume (IC-CBV) (OR 0.547, 95% CI 0.310-0.964) as potential risk factors associated with a poor prognosis. The nomogram model demonstrated the highest predictive efficacy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.960 (95% CI 0.911-0.988), exceeding that of APTw, ADC, and IC-CBV individually. The APTw technique holds potential value in categorizing and managing patients with ischemic stroke, offering guidance for the implementation of clinical treatment strategies. 1 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.","2024","Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI"

However, the prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets of breast cancer are unclear. A prognostic model can help in identifying biomarkers and targets for breast cancer. In this study, a novel prognostic model was developed to optimize treatment, improve clinical prognosis, and screen potential phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) inhibitors for breast cancer treatment. Using data from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified in normal individuals and breast cancer patients. The biological functions of the DEGs were examined using bioinformatics analysis. A novel prognostic model was then constructed using the DEGs through LASSO and multivariate Cox regression analyses. The relationship between the prognostic model, survival, and immunity was also evaluated. In addition, virtual screening was conducted based on the risk genes to identify novel small molecule inhibitors of PGK1 from Chemdiv and Targetmol libraries. The effects of the potential inhibitors were confirmed through cell experiments. A total of 230 up- and 325 down-regulated DEGs were identified in HER2, LumA, LumB, and TN breast cancer subtypes. A new prognostic model was constructed using ten risk genes. The analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) indicated that the prognosis was poorer in the high-risk group compared to the low-risk group. The accuracy of the model was confirmed using the ROC curve. Furthermore, functional enrichment analyses indicated that the DEGs between low- and high-risk groups were linked to the immune response. The risk score was also correlated with tumor immune infiltrates. Moreover, four compounds with the highest score and the lowest affinity energy were identified. Notably, D231-0058 showed better inhibitory activity against breast cancer cells. Ten genes (ACSS2, C2CD2, CXCL9, KRT15, MRPL13, NR3C2, PGK1, PIGR, RBP4, and SORBS1) were identified as prognostic signatures for breast cancer. Additionally, results showed that D231-0058 (2-((((4-(2-methyl-1H-indol-3-yl)-1,3-thiazol-2-yl)carbamoyl)methyl)sulfanyl)acetic acid) may be a novel candidate for treating breast cancer.","2024","Pharmaceuticals (Basel, Switzerland)"

This study attempted to explore key biomarkers for predicting AS in patients with PCOS and to investigate the role of immune cell infiltration in this process. We downloaded the expression matrix of AS (GSE100927, GSE28829) and PCOS (GSE54248) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database. Differential expression analysis and weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) were used to identify PCOS-related genes in AS. Functional enrichment analysis was employed to reveal underlying mechanisms. Then, Protein-protein interaction (PPI) and three machine learning algorithms were used to screen the hub genes, including the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine-Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), and Random Forest (RF). Moreover, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were applied to evaluate the diagnostic value of the nomogram model. Finally, we performed immune cell infiltration and single-gene GSEA. A total of 41 genes were identified as PCOS-related genes in AS, with functional analysis indicating that the potential pathogenesis lies in inflammatory and immune responses. Furthermore, we identified two hub genes (MMP9 and P2RY13) by three machine learning algorithms. The nomogram model based on MMP9 and P2RY13 can be used as a new diagnostic model to differentiate AS in PCOS women (AUC＞0.9). The calibration curves and DCA curves demonstrated the excellent discriminative ability and clinical practicality of this nomogram. Finally, immune infiltration analysis revealed the disorder of immunocytes in AS. The two gene expressions were negatively correlated with Monocyte and Macrophages M1, while positively correlated with Macrophages M0. Single gene GSEA analysis suggested that the MMP9 and P2RY13 might be involved in the metabolism and inflammation responses. We identified MMP9 and P2RY13 as the biomarkers and developed a new nomogram for early diagnosing AS based on them in PCOS patients. Our findings may provide new insights into the diagnosis, prevention, and treatment targets of PCOS-associated AS.","2024","Computers in biology and medicine"

This study aimed to adapt the V-RQOL questionnaire to Azerbaijani-Turkish and evaluate its validity and reliability through cross-cultural adaptation. A cross-sectional and prospective validation design was adopted. The V-RQOL was translated and culturally adapted into the Azerbaijani-Turkish language according to the methodology of standard forward-backward translations to obtain semantic, idiomatic, and conceptual equivalence. The study included 160 participants, with 80 having voice disorders and 80 not having voice disorders. Content validity with four experts through cognitive interviewing and face validity and the pilot study with 10 voice patients was performed. The construct validity was calculated by comparing the total score of the Azerbaijani-Turkish version of V-RQOL (AT-VRQOL) with the self-assessment results. The internal consistency of V-RQOL was examined using Cronbach's alpha coefficient. To calculate the test-retest reliability coefficient, the AT-VRQOL was completed twice by 30 participants, including 20 with voice disorders and 10 without voice disorders, at intervals of 2 weeks. Differences in the V-RQOL scores between participants with and without voice disorders were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The construct validity results showed that the total score of V-RQOL with the self-assessment results is correlated (r = 0.88, P < 0.001). The area under the curve value from the receiver operating characteristic curve was 100. The optimal cut-off point was 21.25, with a sensitivity of 80% and a specificity of 100%. The AT-VRQOL had high internal consistency, indicating excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.98). The total V-RQOL scores obtained from the two administrations of the test-retest reliability were examined. It was found that there was a high degree of correlation between the scores obtained in the two administrations (r = 0.99, P < 0.001). The AT-VRQOL is a valid and reliable scale that can assess patients with voice disorders in a simple, easy, rapid way to apply and not time-consuming.","2024","Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation"

To identify predictive factors for treatment failures in both treatments. Materials & Methods: Prospective clinico-epidemiological data of patients who underwent Urolift® or Rezum® in a single institution for benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) was collected. The choice of intervention depended on the preference of the patients after patient-centric discussions. Results: From October 2019 to October 2022, 86 patients underwent Rezum®, and 62 patients underwent Urolift®. Rezum® involved a longer indwelling catheter duration (12.38 ± 5.548 vs 1.39 ± 3.010 days, p < 0.001) compared with Urolift®. Rezum® was associated with more complications compared with Urolift® (36 [41.9%] vs 10 [16.1%] cases, p < 0.001). Rezum® had more cases of hematuria (17 [19.8%] vs 4 [6.5%] cases [p = 0.022]) and urinary tract infections (27 [31.4%] vs 3 [4.8%] cases, p < 0.001) compared with Urolift®. There were no significant differences in Clavien-Dindo Grade 3-5 complications between the interventions. Urolift® was associated with higher reoperation rates (5 [8.1%] vs 0 [0%] cases, p = 0.010) compared Rezum®. Rezum® had higher anticholinergic usage rates compared with Urolift® post-operation (22 [25.6%] vs 8 [12.9%] cases, p = 0.024). Both interventions showed improvement in the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), quality of life score, and peak velocity flow over the 2 years with no significant difference between the two. Based on receiver operating characteristic curve, preoperation IPSS ≥16 had 95.7% sensitivity and 38.4% specificity to predict the probability of treatment failures after the interventions. Conclusions: There was no difference in clinical outcomes of patients who underwent Rezum® and Urolift®. However, patients who had undergone Rezum® faced more minor complications and more required anti-cholinergic medications. Lastly, physicians should note that patients with IPSS ≥16 would unlikely benefit from either intervention.","2024","Journal of endourology"

Xuefu zhuyu oral liquid (XZOL) is a Chinese patent medicine widely used for TTH in China, but evidence of its efficacy remains scant. The aim of this study was to assess the efficacy and safety of XZOL for TTH patients. This multicenter, double-blind, randomized placebo-controlled trial enrolled 174 patients with TTH in six centers in China from March 2020 to October 2021. Patients were randomly assigned to receive XZOL or a matched placebo for 4weeks. The primary outcome was the change in the mean headache intensity as measured by a visual analogue scale (VAS) from baseline to the end of treatment (Week 4). Secondary outcomes were the change in VAS from baseline to Week 12, the area-under-the-headache curve (AUC), response rate, number of headache days, average headache duration, rescue medication use proportion, etc. RESULTS: Of the 174 patients who were randomized, 160 completed the study. There was no significant difference in the mean change in VAS from baseline to the end of treatment between the XZOL group and the placebo group (-0.29; (95 % CI:0.81 to 0.23; p = 0.279) in the full analysis set (FAS), while there were statistically significant results (-0.9; 95 % CI:1.47 to -0.33; p = 0.002) in the per-protocol set (PPS). There were no significant differences in any of the secondary outcomes. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.

This study focused on the performance of different ML models and clinical explainability. This retrospective study investigated patient data representing 138,560 hospital admissions in the North Denmark Region from 1st January 2017 to 31st December 2018. Fifty-one health sociodemographic and clinical features were extracted as the full dataset, and χ2 test and expert knowledge were used for feature selection, resulting in two reduced datasets. Seven different ML models were trained and compared between the three datasets. The SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) method was used to support population- and patient-level explainability. The best-performing ML model was the neural network model based on the full dataset, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.758. The neural network model was also the best-performing ML model based on the reduced datasets, with an AUC of 0.746. Clinical explainability was demonstrated with a SHAP summary and forceplot. Within 24 h of hospital admission, the ML models were able to identify patients at risk of developing HA-UTI, providing new opportunities to develop efficient strategies for the prevention of HA-UTI.

We also use various methods on the whole PLR waveform including trained, validated and tested (6:3:1) by machine learning models including Multi-layer Perceptron, Support Vector Machine, K-nearest Neighbors, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for two and three-class classification into long-COVID (LCVD), post-COVID (PCVD) or control. Accuracies/AUC of individual or combination of PLR features and ML models using PLR features or whole pupillometric waveform. PLR from a total of 185 subjects including 112 LCVD, 44 PCVD and 29 age/sex-matched controls were analysed. Models examined the independent effects of age and sex. Constriction Time(CT) after the brightest stimulus(L8) is significantly associated with LCVD status(two-way ANOVA, false discovery rate(FDR)<0.001; multinominal logistic regression, FDR<0.05). The overall accuracy/AUC of CT-L8 alone in differentiating LCVD from control or from PCVD were 0.7808/0.8711 and 0.8654/0.8140 respectively. Using cross-validated backward stepwise variable selection, CT-L8, CT-L6, Constriction Velocity(CV)-L6 were most useful to detect LCVD while CV-L8 for PCVD from other groups. The accuracy/AUC of selected features were 0.8000/0.9000 (control versus LCVD) and 0.9062/0.9710 (PCVD versus LCVD), better than when all 27 pupillometric features were combined.

Accurate prediction of disease severity facilitates timely therapeutic interventions. Our study aimed to enhance the predictive capacity of the clinical CRB-65 score by evaluating eight candidate biomarkers: troponin T high-sensitive (TnT-hs), procalcitonin (PCT), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide, angiopoietin-2, copeptin, endothelin-1, lipocalin-2 and mid-regional pro-adrenomedullin. We utilised a machine-learning approach on 800 samples from the German CAPNETZ network (competence network for CAP) to refine risk prediction models combining these biomarkers with the CRB-65 score regarding our defined end-point: death or ICU admission during the current CAP episode within 28 days after study inclusion. Elevated levels of biomarkers were associated with the end-point. TnT-hs exhibited the highest predictive performance among individual features (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC=0.74), followed closely by PCT (AUC=0.73). Combining biomarkers with the CRB-65 score significantly improved prediction accuracy. The combined model of CRB-65, TnT-hs and PCT demonstrated the best balance between high predictive value and parsimony, with an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.72-0.82), while CRB-65 alone achieved an AUC of 0.67 (95% CI: 0.64-0.73). Our findings suggest that augmenting the CRB-65 score with TnT-hs and PCT enhances the prediction of death or ICU admission in hospitalised CAP patients. Validation of this improved risk score in additional CAP cohorts and prospective clinical studies is warranted to assess its broad clinical utility.","2024","ERJ open research"

A retrospective analysis of patients from two medical centers was conducted. From sagittal and axial MR images, the regions of interest were handcrafted to extract radiomics features. Various machine-learning algorithms were employed and combined with clinical features, resulting in the development of a deep-learning radiomics nomogram (DLRN) to predict surgical risk factors for LDH in young adults. The efficacy of the different models and the clinical benefits of the model were compared. We derived six sets of features, including clinical features, radiomics features (Rad_SAG and Rad_AXI) and deep learning features (DL_SAG and DL_AXI) from sagittal and axial MR images, as well as fused deep-learning radiomics (DLR) features. The support vector machine(SVM) algorithm exhibited the best performance. The area under the curve (AUC) of DLR in the training and testing cohorts of 0.991 and 0.939, respectively, were significantly better than those of the models developed with radiomics(Rad_SAG=0.914 and 0.863, Rad_AXI=0.927 and 0.85) and deep-learning features(DL_SAG=0.959 and 0.818, DL_AXI=0.960 and 0.811). The AUC of DLRN coupled with clinical features(ODI, Pfirrmann grade, SLRT, MMFI, and MSU classification) were 0.994 and 0.941 in the training and testing cohorts, respectively. Analysis of the calibration and decision curves demonstrated good agreement between the predicted and observed outcomes, and the use of the DLRN to predict the need for surgical treatment of LDH demonstrated significant clinical benefits. The DLRN established based on clinical and DLR features effectively predicts surgical risk factors for LDH in young adults, offering valuable insights for diagnosis and treatment.","2024","Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare"

Data from the multicentre, prospective Swiss LDR-BT cohort were analyzed for men treated with LDR-BT. Inclusion criteria were minimum follow-up of 3 yr or postoperative treatment with transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP). A total of 914 men were analyzed, with complete data available for 607 men. Pre-interventional variables assessed were International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate volume (PV), maximum urinary flow rate, prostate-specific antigen, postvoid residual urine volume, and age. The primary outcome was poor urinary function after LDR-BT, defined as an IPSS-Quality of Life score >3 (""mostly dissatisfied"" or worse) at 3 yr or the occurrence of TURP during follow-up. Associations were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed. Poor urinary function outcomes were observed in 46 patients (5.0%). Significant predictors included pre-interventional IPSS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per point 1.18; p < 0.001) and PV (aOR per ml, 1.04; p = 0.004). Limitations of the study include potential selection bias and the absence of external validation. Pre-interventional IPSS and PV were significant predictors of poor urinary function after LDR-BT for prostate cancer. A risk calculator based on these parameters was developed to assist individualized treatment planning. Further studies are needed to validate these findings before they can be applied in routine clinical practice. We created a tool to predict the likelihood of urinary problems after a type of radiotherapy called brachytherapy for prostate cancer. The size of the prostate and urinary symptoms before treatment were associated with poor urinary function after treatment. This tool could help doctors and patients in making informed decisions about treatment for prostate cancer.","2025","European urology open science"

This study aimed to identify useful echocardiographic indices for identifying elevated LA pressure in patients with AF. Patients with paroxysmal or persistent AF referred for catheter ablation at two tertiary hospitals were prospectively enrolled. Mean LA pressure was measured immediately after transseptal puncture. Elevated mean LA pressure was defined as ≥15 mmHg. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed to acquire the guideline-recommended parameters. A total of 176 patients were included, and 63 (36%) patients had a mean LA pressure ≥15 mmHg. Patients with elevated LA pressure had more frequent hypertension, larger LA, higher septal E/e', and worse LA strain than the remaining patients. The correlations between mean LA pressure and each echocardiographic parameter were weak. Septal E/e' ratio showed the best correlation with mean LA pressure (r = 0.351, P < 0.001), and septal E/e' ratio ≥11 was the best parameter (area under the curve = 0.7, sensitivity = 65%, specificity = 73%, accuracy = 70%) to identify elevated mean LA pressure. A hierarchical algorithm consisting of septal E/e' ratio, LA reservoir strain, and LA volume index improved identification of patients with elevated mean LA pressure (sensitivity = 61%, specificity = 91%, accuracy = 80%). In patients with AF, the septal E/e' ratio was the best single parameter for identifying elevated mean LA pressure. A hierarchical algorithm combining the septal E/e' ratio, LA reservoir strain, and LA volume index helps identify elevated LA pressure in patients with AF.","2024","European heart journal.

A retrospective cohort study including patients admitted to level-1 trauma centers and registered in the TQIP, a US nationwide trauma registry, admitted between 2013-2015 and 2017-2019. The main outcome was total nosocomial pneumonia for the first period and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) for the second. Model discrimination and calibration were assessed before and after recalibration. The study comprised 902,231 trauma patients (N2013-2015 ​= ​180,601; N2017-2019 ​= ​721,630), with a median age of 52 in both periods, 64-65 ​% male, and approximately 90 ​% sustaining blunt traumatic injury. The median Injury Severity Scores were 13 (2013-2015) versus 9 (2017-2019); median Glasgow Coma Scale scores were 15. Nosocomial pneumonia incidence was 4.4 ​%, VAP incidence was 0.7 ​%.

After recalibration, discriminatory capacity and calibration for the lower predicted probabilities improved. The Croce model can identify patients admitted to US level-1 trauma centers at risk of total nosocomial pneumonia and VAP. Implementing (modified) Croce models in route trauma clinical practice could guide judicious use of preventative measures and prescription of additional non-invasive preventative measures (e.g., increased monitoring, pulmonary physiotherapy) to decrease the occurrence of nosocomial pneumonia in at-risk patients.","2024","American journal of surgery"

The objective of this study was to evaluate cefiderocol concentrations in both serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) during the treatment of ventriculitis. A 54-year-old patient with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii ventriculitis was given cefiderocol intravenously 2 g every 6 h (each dose administered over 3 h). Serial samples were obtained over a dosing interval at steady state, and cefiderocol concentrations in serum and CSF were assayed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Cefiderocol serum concentration-time profile was characterized by a one-compartment model with zero-order input. Penetration into CSF was estimated as the CSF AUC/unbound serum AUC ratio. Observed total serum concentrations ranged between 24.6 and 76.7 mg/L, while CSF concentrations were approximately 10.0 mg/L. The AUC0-6 of the free drug in serum and CSF were 181.6 and 60.2 mg h/L, respectively. We observed minimal fluctuation of cefiderocol concentrations in CSF, questioning the conventional reliance on CSF/serum area under the curve (AUC) ratio as a measure of CNS penetration. Our experience suggests that a single CSF concentration (random or trough) could be directly compared to the minimum inhibitory concentration, offering a potentially simpler approach to evaluate dosing adequacy.","2025","Pharmacotherapy"

The secondary objective was to recalibrate these scores. Data from 56 US and Dutch hospitals with paediatric caseloads were included. The primary outcome was 30-day mortality. To assess model discrimination, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PR) were calculated. Model calibration was assessed by plotting the observed and predicted probabilities. Decision analytic curves were fit. The 30-day mortality was 0.14% (822/606 488). The AUROC for the PRAm upon external validation was 0.856 (95% confidence interval 0.844-0.869), and the AUC-PR was 0.008. Upon recalibration, the AUROC was 0.873 (0.861-0.886), and the AUC-PR was 0.031. The AUROC for the external validation of the intrinsic surgical risk score was 0.925 (0.914-0.936) and AUC-PR was 0.085. Upon recalibration, the AUROC was 0.925 (0.915-0.936), and the AUC-PR was 0.094. Calibration metrics for both scores were favourable because of the large cluster of cases with low probabilities of mortality. Decision curve analyses showed limited benefit to using either score. The intrinsic surgical risk score performed better than the PRAm, but both resulted in large numbers of false positives. Both scores exhibited decreased performance compared with the original studies. ASA physical status scores in sicker patients drove the superior performance of the intrinsic surgical risk score, suggesting the use of a risk score does not improve prediction.","2024","British journal of anaesthesia"

Current findings indicate a strong potential for contrastive pre-training on medical images. However, further research is necessary to incorporate the particular characteristics of these images. We hypothesize that the similarity of medical images hinders the success of contrastive learning in the medical imaging domain. To this end, we investigate different strategies based on deep embedding, information theory, and hashing in order to identify and reduce redundancy in medical pre-training datasets. The effect of these different reduction strategies on contrastive learning is evaluated on two pre-training datasets and several downstream classification tasks. In all of our experiments, dataset reduction leads to a considerable performance gain in downstream tasks, e.g., an AUC score improvement from 0.78 to 0.83 for the COVID CT Classification Grand Challenge, 0.97 to 0.98 for the OrganSMNIST Classification Challenge and 0.73 to 0.83 for a brain hemorrhage classification task. Furthermore, pre-training is up to nine times faster due to the dataset reduction. In conclusion, the proposed approach highlights the importance of dataset quality and provides a transferable approach to improve contrastive pre-training for classification downstream tasks on medical images.","2024","Computers in biology and medicine"

High nodal burden (≥4 axillary nodal metastases) is an indication for intensified treatment in luminal breast cancer; hence, abstaining from CALND may result in undertreatment. To develop a prediction model for high nodal burden in luminal ERBB2-negative breast cancer (all histologic types and lobular breast cancer separately) without CALND. The prospective Sentinel Node Biopsy in Breast Cancer: Omission of Axillary Clearance After Macrometastases (SENOMAC) trial randomized patients 1:1 to CALND or its omission from January 2015 to December 2021 among adult patients with cN0 T1-T3 breast cancer and 1 or 2 SLN macrometastases across 5 European countries. The cohort was randomly split into training (80%) and test (20%) sets, with equal proportions of high nodal burden. Prediction models were developed by multivariable logistic regression in the complete luminal ERBB2-negative cohort and a lobular breast cancer subgroup. Nomograms were constructed. The present diagnostic/prognostic study presents the results of a prespecified secondary analysis of the SENOMAC trial. Herein, only patients with luminal ERBB2-negative tumors assigned to CALND were selected. Data analysis for this article took place from June 2023 to April 2024. Predictors of high nodal burden. High nodal burden was defined as ≥4 axillary nodal metastases. The luminal prediction model was evaluated regarding discrimination and calibration.

The aim of this meta-analysis is to examine whether RT-induced Skm hypertrophy drives improvements in glucose metabolism and to explore confounders, such as biological sex and training parameters. Random-effects meta-analyses were performed using variance random effects. Meta-regressions were performed for confounding factors depending on the heterogeneity (I2). Analyses from 33 intervention studies revealed significant within-study increases in FFM with a moderate effect size (within-studies: (effect size; ES = 0.24 [0.10; 0.39]; p = 0.002; I2 = 56%) and a tendency for significance when compared with control groups (ES = 0.42 [-0.04-0.88]; p = 0.07).

When compared to control groups, there was no significant difference in 2 h glucose, nor in glucose AUC from baseline in RT intervention groups. Meta-regression analyses failed to consistently reveal increases in FFM as a moderator of glucose homeostasis. Other mixed-effect models were also unsuccessful to unveil biological sex or training parameters as moderators of FFM increases and glucose homeostasis changes. Although Skm hypertrophy and improvements in glycemic control occur concurrently during RT, changes in these variables were not always related.

Patients were randomly divided into a primary cohort (n=127) and a validation cohort (n=54) at a ratio of 7:3. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to optimize the feature selection of the prediction model. Combined with the best characteristics of LASSO regression, the prediction model was established by multivariate Cox regression analysis. The predictive models' identification, calibration, and clinical practicability were evaluated by the C index, calibration curve, and decision curve. The prognosis of patients with different grades was compared by survival analysis. Internal validation of the model used data from the validation cohort. The predictive factors included in the nomogram were lesion site, use of antiplatelet drugs, application of drug coating technology, calibration, coronary heart disease, and international normalized ratio (INR). The prediction model demonstrated good calibration ability, and the C index was 0.762 (95% confidence interval: 0.691-0.823). The C index of the validation cohort was 0.864 (95% confidence interval: 0.801-0.927), which also showed good calibration ability. The decision curve shows that when the threshold probability of the prediction model is more significant than 2.5%, the patients benefit significantly from our prediction model, and the maximum net benefit rate is 30.9%. Patients were graded according to the nomogram. Survival analysis found that there was a significant difference in the postoperative primary patency rate between patients of different classifications (log-rank p<0.001) in both the primary cohort and the validation cohort. We developed a nomogram to predict the risk of target vessel restenosis after endovascular treatment by considering information on lesion site, postoperative antiplatelet drugs, calcification, coronary heart disease, drug coating technology, and INR. Clinicians can grade patients after endovascular procedure according to the scores of the nomograms and apply intervention measures of different intensities for people at different risk levels.

However, computer tomography (CT), as a suggested standard method for diagnosing sarcopenia, is resource intensive and involves radiation exposure. Therefore, in this study, we evaluate the muscle thickness of quadriceps femoris measured by ultrasound (US) as a prognostic parameter for AD and all-cause mortality in chronic liver disease. Sixty-three patients with chronic liver disease and signs of portal hypertension were analysed in this prospective monocentric study for the occurrence of acute decompensation such as hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, haemorrhage and liver-related death within 1 year. We assessed muscle thickness at three different heights in terms of suitability as a predictor. Among all 63 patients, 15 patients experienced acute decompensation, and 9 patients died due to liver-related death. We found the upper third of the muscle, measured without applying pressure with the transducer, to be the most significant for predicting AD/ACLF [AUC 0.739 (confidence interval (CI) 0.604-0.874, p = 0.006]. A cut-off value of US-defined muscle thickness standardized per height for identifying sarcopenia was determined (1.83 cm/m). Patients with US-defined sarcopenia showed significantly higher rates of AD (38.9% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.001) and all-over 1-year mortality (27.8% vs. 3.7%, p = 0.013). The mean AD free survival time is 8.3 months (95% CI 6.6-9.9) for sarcopenic patients and 11.8 months (95% CI 11.0-12.6) for the non-sarcopenic cohorts. Corresponding CT analysis displayed similar results for AD free survival for both groups (40% AD rate in the sarcopenic group vs. 7% AD rate in the non-sarcopenic group, p = 0.001). The risk for AD was significantly higher in the sarcopenic cohort compared with those without sarcopenia in both US and CT (US: HR 16.6; p = 0.009; 95% CI 2.0-136.0; CT: HR 8.7; p = 0.017; 95% CI 1.5-51.0). CT and US displayed a moderate agreement (p = 0.006; κ = 0.379). Sarcopenia classification based on US measurements is shown to be an independent predictor of AD occurrence within 1 year. This pilot study is the first to suggest that screening for sarcopenia by ultrasonography may be useful for risk assessment in patients with chronic liver disease and signs of portal hypertension.","2024","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle"

Multivariate logistic regression was used to construct the CCTF, CCTF-CTRV (category of tumor-related vessel), and CCTF-QTRV (quantity of tumor-related vessel) nomograms. The performance and utility of the nomograms were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI), and decision curve analysis (DCA). The AUC of the CCTF-QTRV nomogram, which included the features of smoking history, nodule pattern, lobulation, and the number of distorted and dilated vessels, was higher than the AUCs of the CCTF and CCTF-CTRV nomograms in both the training set (AUC: 0.906 vs. 0.857; vs. 0.851) and the validation set (AUC: 0.909 vs. 0.796; vs. 0.871). DCA indicated that both patients and clinicians could benefit from using the nomogram. The nomogram constructed by combining MATRV, CCTF, and clinical information can more effectively predict the two-year growth of GGNs. This integrated approach enhances the predictive accuracy, making it a valuable tool for clinicians in managing and monitoring patients with GGNs.","2024","Academic radiology"

In this study, we pilot a machine learning approach for prediction of binding preference. We trained a convolutional neural network to predict the α2,6-linked sialic acid preference of influenza A viruses given the hemagglutinin amino acid sequence. The model was evaluated with an independent test dataset to assess the standard performance metrics, the impact of missing data in the test sequences, and the prediction performance on novel subtypes. Further, features found to be important to the generation of predictions were tested via targeted mutagenesis of H9 and H16 proteins expressed on pseudoviruses. The final model developed in this study produced predictions on a test dataset correctly 94% of the time and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.93. The model tolerated about 10% missing test data without compromising accurate prediction performance. Predictions on novel subtypes revealed that the model can extrapolate feature relationships between subtypes when generating binding predictions. Finally, evaluation of the features important for model predictions helped identify positions that alter the sialic acid conformation preference of hemagglutinin proteins in practice. Ultimately, our results provide support to this in silico approach to hemagglutinin receptor binding preference prediction. This work emphasizes the need for ongoing research efforts to produce tools that may aid future pandemic risk assessment.","2024","Influenza and other respiratory viruses"

Macroscopic on-site evaluation (MOSE) is an alternative modality although it is not standardized for EUS-guided fine-needle biopsy (FNB). We evaluated diagnostic performance of MOSE compared with conventional technique of EUS-TA using core biopsy needle. Consecutive patients undergoing EUS-FNA for solid lesions were randomized to MOSE or conventional arms. The primary and secondary outcome measures were diagnostic accuracy, diagnostic yield, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the number of passes, respectively. The optimum parameters for macroscopic visible core (MVC, i.e., length, number) by MOSE to achieve accurate diagnosis were evaluated. Ninety-six patients (48 conventional and 48 MOSE) were enrolled. Mean lesion size was larger in MOSE arm (32.67 ± 7.22 vs 29.31 ± 6.98 mm, P = 0.023). Diagnostic accuracy (95.8% vs 91.6%), diagnostic yield (97.9% vs 95.8%), procedure duration, and adverse events of the two methods were similar. Median number of passes with MOSE was less (2 vs 3 P = 0.000). Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve showed that with MOSE, obtaining a total MVC length of 11.5 mm had 93.3% sensitivity, and 2.5 MVC cores (each 4 mm) had 86.7% sensitivity for malignancy diagnosis. EUS-FNB with MOSE, a simple reliable technique, can achieve a high and comparable diagnostic accuracy with lesser number of passes. Obtaining longer length and greater number of MVC increase the sensitivity to diagnose malignancy with MOSE.","2024","Journal of gastroenterology and hepatology"

Given that AD neuropathology begins decades before symptoms, there is a dire need for effective screening tools for early detection of AD to facilitate early intervention. Here, we used tree-based and deep learning methods to train polyomic prediction models for AD affection status and age at onset, employing genomic, proteomic, metabolomic, and drug use data from UK Biobank. We used SHAP to determine the feature's importance. Our best-performing polyomic model achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUROC) of 0.87. We identified GFAP and CXCL17 proteins to be the strongest predictors of AD, besides apolipoprotein E (APOE) alleles. Increasing the number of cases by including ""AD-by-proxy"" cases did not improve AD prediction. Among the four modalities, genomics, and proteomics were the most informative modality based on AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve). Our data suggest that two blood-based biomarkers (glial fibrillary acidic protein [GFAP] and CXCL17) may be effective for early presymptomatic prediction of AD. We developed a polyomic model to predict AD and age-at-onset using omics and medication use data from EHR. We identified GFAP and CXCL17 proteins to be the strongest predictors of AD, besides APOE alleles. ""AD-by-proxy"" cases, if used in training, do not improve AD prediction.

This is a prospective cohort study. This study included 1332 women who delivered at Peking University International Hospital between October 2017 and August 2019. Participants were divided equally into three groups based on the TyG index. Logistic regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses were used to evaluate the relationship between the TyG index and macrosomia and conducted subgroup analyses. The TyG index's ability to predict macrosomia was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed that the TyG index is an independent risk factor for macrosomia (Odds ratio [OR] 1.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.02-3.30, p < .05). RCS analysis indicates that the risk of macrosomia increases with the rise of the TyG index (p for nonlinearity <.001) when the TyG index is >6.53. Subgroup analysis showed a synergistic additive interaction between the TyG index and gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) of macrosomia. The area under the ROC curve for the predictive model was 0.733 (95% CI 0.684, 0.781), with a sensitivity of 76.4% and specificity of 66.9%. Incorporating the TyG index alongside traditional risk factors notably enhances macrosomia prediction (p < .05). The TyG index independently predicts macrosomia, and exhibits an additive interaction with GDM in its occurrence.

This study included 51 PMBL and 375 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (DLBCL-NOS) from the GEO database and 65 PMBL and 117 DLBCL-NOS from a single center. At the transcriptional and protein levels, RHOF expression in PMBL was significantly higher than in DLBCL-NOS (P < 0.001). ROC curve analysis suggested that high RHOF expression had a high discriminative diagnostic ability for PMBL and DLBCL-NOS (transcriptional level, AUC = 0.913-0.940; protein level, AUC = 0.878). Comparing RHOF with commonly used PMBL diagnostic markers CD23, CD30, and PD-L1, it was found that high RHOF expression is a more useful diagnostic marker for PMBL (AUC (RHOF) = 0.878 > AUC (CD23) = 0.818 > AUC (CD30) = 0.756 > AUC (PD-L1) = 0.590). The diagnostic model based on CD23, CD30, and RHOF exhibits higher sensitivity for the diagnosis of PMBL than any of the individual markers mentioned above. Concerning prognosis, high RHOF transcriptional expression was significantly associated with poorer overall survival (OS) in PMBL (P = 0.00037), while high RHOF protein expression was significantly associated with poorer OS and progression-free survival (PFS) in PMBL (P = 0.034; P = 0.034). This study indicates that high RHOF expression in PMBL is closely associated with the diagnosis, prognosis, and clinical pathological features of the disease. High RHOF expression demonstrates a superior diagnostic ability in distinguishing PMBL from DLBCL-NOS compared to existing markers. Furthermore, research on RHOF expression in PMBL holds promise for providing new targets and insights for prognosis assessment and treatment of PMBL.","2024","Virchows Archiv : an international journal of pathology"

However, when inflammation becomes chronic, it leads to numerous serious disorders, particularly in autoimmune diseases. Anti-inflammatory peptides (AIPs) have emerged as promising therapeutic agents due to their high specificity, potency, and low toxicity. However, identifying AIPs using traditional in vivo methods is time-consuming and expensive. Recent advancements in computational-based intelligent models for peptides have offered a cost-effective alternative for identifying various inflammatory diseases, owing to their selectivity toward targeted cells with low side effects. In this paper, we propose a novel computational model, namely, DeepAIPs-Pred, for the accurate prediction of AIP sequences. The training samples are represented using LBP-PSSM- and LBP-SMR-based evolutionary image transformation methods. Additionally, to capture contextual semantic features, we employed attention-based ProtBERT-BFD embedding and QLC for structural features. Furthermore, differential evolution (DE)-based weighted feature integration is utilized to produce a multiview feature vector. The SMOTE-Tomek Links are introduced to address the class imbalance problem, and a two-layer feature selection technique is proposed to reduce and select the optimal features. Finally, the novel self-normalized bidirectional temporal convolutional networks (SnBiTCN) are trained using optimal features, achieving a significant predictive accuracy of 94.92% and an AUC of 0.97. The generalization of our proposed model is validated using two independent datasets, demonstrating higher performance with the improvement of ∼2 and ∼10% of accuracies than the existing state-of-the-art model using Ind-I and Ind-II, respectively. The efficacy and reliability of DeepAIPs-Pred highlight its potential as a valuable and promising tool for drug development and research academia.","2024","Journal of chemical information and modeling"

Ablation index (AI) and generator impedance drop (ID) predict lesion size but their correlation with long-term outcomes in prAF is not known. Furthermore, we proposed a new parameter, efficacy ratio (ER) calculated as ID/AI, to gain indirect insight into the role of factors affecting ID but not considered by AI. We included ablations performed during the DECAAF II trial if they had uploaded lesion-by-lesion summary data and were performed with radiofrequency catheters on the CARTO system. Average patient-level parameters were calculated from all generated Vizitags. A total of 427 ablations met inclusion criteria and 166 utilized AI. Analyzed as continuous variables, ID and ER predicted long-term arrhythmia-free survival but not AI. The ideal cut-off for ID was ID ≥ 10.4 ohms and had a C-index of 0.55. It predicted reduced risk of arrhythmia: hazard ratio 0.56 [0.36-0.88], p = .013 (arrhythmia-free survival of 67% vs. 52%). Similarly, an ER of 1.7 ohms/100AI had a C-index of 0.58 and predicted reduced arrhythmia recurrence: HR 0.39 [0.22-0.69], p = .001. ER < 1.7 ohms/100AI was related to just 32% arrhythmia-free survival. ER improved prognostication as compared to ID alone and identified a subset of low ID patients with even worse outcomes. Average ID was predictive of improved outcomes following ablation of prAF. The ratio of ID/AI (ER) was postulated as a measure to summarize the overall impact of factors not considered in the AI formula and provided improved prognostication.","2024","Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology"

A total of 126 AD patients underwent T1WI-based magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations, along with 108 age-sex-matched healthy controls (HC). This was a retrospective, single-center study conducted from November 2021 to February 2023. AD patients were categorized into two groups based on disease progression and cognitive function: AD-MCI and dementia (AD-D). T1WI-based radiomics features of the bilateral hippocampi were extracted. To diagnose AD and differentiate between AD-MCI and AD-D, predictive models were developed using random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and support vector machine (SVM). We compared radiomics features between the AD and HC groups, as well as within the subgroups of AD-MCI and AD-D. Area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were all used to assess model performance. Furthermore, correlations between radiomics features and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, tau protein phosphorylated at threonine 181 (P-tau-181), and amyloid β peptide1-42 (Aβ1-42) were analyzed. The RF model demonstrated superior performance in distinguishing AD from HC (AUC=0.961, accuracy=90.8%, sensitivity=90.7%, specificity=90.9%) and in identifying AD-MCI and AD-D (AUC=0.875, accuracy=80.7%, sensitivity=87.2%, specificity=73.2%) compared to the other models. Additionally, radiomics features were correlated with MMSE scores, P-tau-181, and Aβ1-42 levels in AD. T1WI-based hippocampal radiomics features are valuable for diagnosing AD and identifying AD-MCI and AD-D.","2024","Academic radiology"

This study aimed to assess the diagnostic efficacy of multimodal ultrasound for mass and non-mass enhancements in Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced MRI (DCE-MRI) of IGM and breast cancer. A retrospective analysis involved patients confirmed histopathologically with IGM and BC. All patients underwent conventional ultrasound (C-US), ultrasound elastography (UE), contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), and DCE-MRI examinations. Blinded experienced radiologists assessed imaging findings. Diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for mass and non-mass enhancements. For mass enhancements (ME), multimodal ultrasound demonstrated strong efficacy (AUC = 0.8651, 95 % CI: 0.7431 to 0.9871), exhibiting high sensitivity (83.3 %) and specificity (92.4 %) in differentiating IGM from breast cancer. However, for non-mass enhancements (NME), multimodal ultrasound showed limited accuracy (AUC = 0.6306) with lower sensitivity (65.6 %) and specificity (81.2 %) in distinguishing between IGM and breast cancer. Multimodal ultrasound displayed good diagnostic efficacy for mass enhancements in DCE-MRI for IGM and breast cancer, while for non-mass enhancement patterns, DCE-MRI remains the most valuable radiological modality for comprehensively assessing this condition's complexities.","2024","Breast (Edinburgh, Scotland)"

This is a retrospective analysis of a multi-institutional database comprising 753 patients who underwent RNU for UTUC and had a preoperative plasma available. Logistic and Cox regression analyses were performed. The discriminative ability and clinical utility of the models was calculated using the lasso regression test, area under receiver operating characteristics curves, C-index, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Lower preoperative plasma levels of IGFBP-2 and -3 independently correlated with increased risks of lymph node metastasis, pT3/4 disease, nonorgan confined disease, and worse recurrence-free survival (RFS), cancer-specific survival (CSS), and overall survival (OS) (all P ≤ .004). The addition of both IGFBP-2 and -3 to a postoperative multivariable model, that included standard clinicopathologic characteristics, improved the model's concordance index by 10%, 9%, and 8% for RFS, CSS, and OS, respectively. On DCA, addition of both IGFBP-2 and -3 to base models improved their performance for RFS, CSS, and OS by a statistically and clinically significant margin. Plasma IGF-1 was not associated with any of outcomes. We confirmed that a lower plasma levels of IGFBP-2 and -3 both are independent and clinically significant predictors of adverse pathological features and survival outcomes in UTUC patients treated with RNU.

325,"38707536","Unitig-centered pan-genome machine learning approach for predicting antibiotic resistance and discovering novel resistance genes in bacterial strains.","In current genomic research, the widely used methods for predicting antimicrobial resistance (AMR) often rely on prior knowledge of known AMR genes or reference genomes. However, these methods have limitations, potentially resulting in imprecise predictions owing to incomplete coverage of AMR mechanisms and genetic variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a pan-genome-based machine learning approach to advance our understanding of AMR gene repertoires and uncover possible feature sets for precise AMR classification. By building compacted de Brujin graphs (cDBGs) from thousands of genomes and collecting the presence/absence patterns of unique sequences (unitigs) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we determined that using machine learning models on unitig-centered pan-genomes showed significant promise for accurately predicting the antibiotic resistance or susceptibility of microbial strains. Applying a feature-selection-based machine learning algorithm led to satisfactory predictive performance for the training dataset (with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of > 0.929) and an independent validation dataset (AUC, approximately 0.77). Furthermore, the selected unitigs revealed previously unidentified resistance genes, allowing for the expansion of the resistance gene repertoire to those that have not previously been described in the literature on antibiotic resistance. These results demonstrate that our proposed unitig-based pan-genome feature set was effective in constructing machine learning predictors that could accurately identify AMR pathogens. Gene sets extracted using this approach may offer valuable insights into expanding known AMR genes and forming new hypotheses to uncover the underlying mechanisms of bacterial AMR.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

Our previous work has identified a three-way interaction among pack-year of smoking (the number of packs of cigarettes smoked per day multiplied by the number of years the person has smoked) and two DNA methylation probes (cg05293407TRIM27 and cg00060500KIAA0226). However, whether a four-way interaction exists remains unclear. Therefore, we adopted a two-phase design to identify the four-way gene-smoking interactions by a hill-climbing strategy on the basis of the previously detected three-way interaction. One CpG probe, cg16658473SHISA9, was identified with FDR-q ≤ 0.05 in the discovery phase and P ≤ 0.05 in the validation phase. Meanwhile, the four-way interaction improved the discrimination ability for the prognostic prediction model, as indicated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for both 3- and 5-year survival. In summary, we identified a four-way interaction associated with NSCLC survival among pack-year of smoking, cg05293407TRIM27, cg00060500KIAA0226 and g16658473SHISA9, providing novel insights into the complex mechanisms underlying NSCLC progression.","2025","Molecular oncology"

This study aims to analyze whether CHLN metastasis in NMNSCLC is commonly overestimated in clinical practice and to establish a predictive model for enhanced precision. We conducted a retrospective analysis of 834 pathologically confirmed NMNSCLC patients. Monitoring of treatment responses and regular ≥ 1 year CT follow-up was used to determine the nature of CHLN. Lasso regression was used to select predictive factors, and a multivariate binary logistic regression model (HAM) was constructed. Internal validation was performed using ten-fold cross-validation. The CHLN metastasis rate was 4.4% among the NMNSCLC patients. The positive predictive value (PPV) and sensitivity for PET-CT diagnosis were 36.8% and 67.5%, while for CT they are 44.8% and 70.2%, respectively. The five optimal predictive factors (emphysema or bullae, central-type lung cancer, short diameter of CHLN, calcification and SUVmax) were used to develop the HAM model. The Area under curve (AUC) values for PET-CT, CT, and HAM model were 0.81, 0.83, and 0.96, respectively. The F1 scores for PET-CT and CT were 0.48 and 0.55, respectively, while the maximum F1 score of our model was 0.73, with corresponding PPV and sensitivity of 66.7%, and 81.1%, respectively. CHLN metastasis is rare in NMNSCLC patients. PET-CT diagnosis significantly overestimates CHLN metastasis and the HAM model improves clinical decision-making in this study. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these conclusions.","2024","Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology"

However, existing delirium assessment tools do not account for neurologic deficits that often interfere with conventional testing and are therefore unreliable in neurocritically ill patients. We aimed to determine the accuracy and predictive validity of the Fluctuating Mental Status Evaluation (FMSE), a novel delirium screening tool developed specifically for neurocritically ill patients. Prospective validation study. Neurocritical care unit at an academic medical center. One hundred thirty-nine neurocritically ill stroke patients (mean age, 63.9 [ sd , 15.9], median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 11 [interquartile range, 2-17]). None. Expert raters performed daily Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition-based delirium assessments, while paired FMSE assessments were performed by trained clinicians. We analyzed 717 total noncomatose days of paired assessments, of which 52% ( n = 373) were rated by experts as days with delirium; 53% of subjects were delirious during one or more days. Compared with expert ratings, the overall accuracy of the FMSE was high (area under the curve [AUC], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82-0.87). FMSE scores greater than or equal to 1 had 86% sensitivity and 74% specificity on a per-assessment basis, while scores greater than or equal to 2 had 70% sensitivity and 88% specificity. Accuracy remained high in patients with aphasia (FMSE ≥ 1: 82% sensitivity, 64% specificity; FMSE ≥ 2: 64% sensitivity, 84% specificity) and those with decreased arousal (FMSE ≥ 1: 87% sensitivity, 77% specificity; FMSE ≥ 2: 71% sensitivity, 90% specificity).

A deep learning approach based on a modified one-dimensional U-Net, termed Z-spectral compressed sensing (CS), was proposed to recover dense Z-spectra from sparse ones. The neural network was trained using simulated Z-spectra generated by the Bloch equation with various parameter settings. Its feasibility and effectiveness were validated through numerical simulations and in vivo rat brain experiments, compared with commonly used linear, pchip, and Lorentzian interpolation methods. The proposed method was applied to detect metabolism-related changes in the 6-hydroxydopamine PD model with multipool CEST MRI, including APT, CEST@2 ppm, nuclear Overhauser enhancement, direct saturation, and magnetization transfer, and the prediction performance was evaluated by area under the curve. The numerical simulations and in vivo rat-brain experiments demonstrated that the proposed method could yield superior fidelity in retrieving dense Z-spectra compared with existing methods. Significant differences were observed in APT, CEST@2 ppm, nuclear Overhauser enhancement, and direct saturation between the striatum regions of wild-type and PD models, whereas magnetization transfer exhibited no significant difference. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that multipool CEST achieved better predictive performance compared with individual pools. Combined with Z-spectral CS, the scan time of multipool CEST MRI can be reduced to 33% without distinctly compromising prediction accuracy. The integration of Z-spectral CS with multipool CEST MRI can enhance the prediction accuracy of PD and maintain the scan time within a reasonable range.","2024","Magnetic resonance in medicine"

An ECG-AI model was developed by splitting patients into non-overlapping data sets: 70% for training, 10% for validation, and 20% for testing. The performance of ECG-AI, clinical models, and PGS was assessed in the test data set. The ECG-AI model was externally validated in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care-IV (MIMIC-IV) hospital data set. A total of 669 782 ECGs from 145 323 patients were included. Mean age was 61 ± 15 years, and 58% were male. The primary outcome was observed in 15% of patients, and the ECG-AI model showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUC-ROC) curve of .78. In time-to-event analysis including the first ECG, ECG-AI inference of high risk identified 26% of the population with a 4.3-fold increased risk of incident AF (95% confidence interval: 4.02-4.57). In a subgroup analysis of 2301 patients, ECG-AI outperformed CHARGE-AF (AUC-ROC = .62) and PGS (AUC-ROC = .59). Adding PGS and CHARGE-AF to ECG-AI improved goodness of fit (likelihood ratio test P < .001), with minimal changes to the AUC-ROC (.76-.77). In the external validation cohort (mean age 59 ± 18 years, 47% male, median follow-up 1.1 year), ECG-AI model performance remained consistent (AUC-ROC = .77).

To overcome these limitations, we acquired a dataset utilizing both wireless wearable multimodal sensors and salivary cortisol tests for supervised learning. We also developed a novel deep neural network (DNN) model that maximizes the benefits of sensor fusion. We devised a DNN involving a shuffled efficient channel attention (ECA) module called a shuffled ECA-Net, which achieves advanced feature-level sensor fusion by considering inter-modality relationships. Through an experiment involving salivary cortisol tests on 26 participants, we acquired multiple bio-signals including electrocardiograms, respiratory waveforms, and electrogastrograms in both relaxed and stressed mental states. A training dataset was generated from the obtained data. Using the dataset, our proposed model was optimized and evaluated ten times through five-fold cross-validation, while varying a random seed. Our proposed model achieved acceptable performance in stress detection, showing 0.916 accuracy, 0.917 sensitivity, 0.916 specificity, 0.914 F1-score, and 0.964 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC).

This study is to employ Bayesian networks (BN) for assessing the pre-test probability (PTP) of AF in patients with CAD. A total of 12,552 patients with CAD were divided into the CAD patients with AF group (CHD-AF group) and the CAD patients without AF group (non-AF group). Univariate analysis and LASSO regression method were used to screen for potential risk factors. The maximum-minimum climb (MMHC) algorithm was used to construct the directed acyclic graph (DAG) of BN. Predictive power was tested using internal validation, external validation and 10-fold internal cross-validation. Finally, the generated BN model was compared with four machine learning algorithms. Fourteen indicators were included in the BN, including age, gender, systolic blood pressure (SBP), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), serum uric acid (UA), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GGT), direct bilirubin (DBIL), lipoproteins [LP(a)], NYHA cardiac function grading, diabetes mellitus and hypertension, palpitation, dyspnoea and the left atrial diameter.

Preoperative sonographic exams, including gray-scale ultrasound (G-US), color Doppler flow imaging (CDFI), and contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS), were conducted. Sonographic scans were retrospectively reviewed alongside clinicopathological data. Binary logistic regression identified independent risk factors for screening atypical/malignant papillary lesions. The receiver operating characteristic curve evaluated the predictive accuracy of these lesions, resulting in the development of a nomogram for assessing risk. The study involved 176 female patients with breast papillary lesions, identifying key predictors for atypical or malignant outcomes: age 57 or order, US diameter ≥13.95 mm, resistive index ≥0.70, enlarged enhancement on CEUS, and contrast agent retention, with respective odds ratios of 6.279, 8.078, 9.246, 9.401, and 5.047. The integrated use of G-US, CDFI, and CEUS in the MpUS approach offered higher diagnostic accuracy (AUC: 0.966) than G-US or CDFI alone (0.869/0.918). CEUS particularly enhanced prediction for non-mass-like lesions, with a positive predictive value of 83.3%. A nomogram incorporating MpUS and patient age achieved an AUC of 0.956 for predicting atypical or malignant papillary lesions. MpUS imaging is highly effective for predicting malignant breast papillary lesions, especially considering patient age. The nomogram offers an intuitive framework for assessing malignant risk in these lesions. Ultrasound excels in identifying papillary lesions, and integrating diverse data and multi-parametric imaging enhances malignant risk evaluation. This study establishes a predictive risk model using the nomogram method, demonstrating heightened diagnostic efficacy in breast papillary lesions.","2024","The British journal of radiology"

The L1 vertebrae of 111 patients (55 men, 56 women; median age, 62 years) who underwent DECT between 01/2015 and 12/2018 were retrospectively analyzed. For phantomless bone mineral density (BMD) assessment, a specialized DECT postprocessing software employing material decomposition was utilized. The digital records of all patients were monitored for two years after the DECT scans to track the incidence of osteoporotic fractures. Diagnostic accuracy parameters were calculated for all metrics using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall (PR) curves. Logistic regression models were used to determine associations of various predictive metrics with the occurrence of osteoporotic fractures. Patients who sustained one or more osteoporosis-associated fractures in a 2-year interval were significantly older (median age 74.5 years [IQR 57-83 years]) compared those without such fractures (median age 50.5 years [IQR 38.5-69.5 years]). According to logistic regression models, DECT-derived BMD was the sole predictive parameter significantly associated with osteoporotic fracture occurrence across all age groups. ROC and PR curve analyses confirmed the highest diagnostic accuracy for DECT-based BMD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.95 [95% CI: 0.89-0.98] for the ROC curve and an AUC of 0.96 [95% CI: 0.85-0.99] for the PR curve. The diagnostic performance of DECT-based BMD in predicting the 2-year risk of osteoporotic fractures is greater than that of HU-based metrics and the cortical thickness ratio. DECT-based BMD values are highly valuable in identifying patients at risk for osteoporotic fractures.","2024","Academic radiology"

The present study was performed to explore the diagnostic value of the levels of the pyroptosis-related protein nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain, leucine-rich repeat and pyrin domain-containing 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome in the expressed prostatic secretions (EPS) of patients with CP. A total of 167 CP patients, including 85 National Institutes of Health (NIH)-IIIA CP patients and 82 NIH-IIIB CP patients, as well as 80 benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients and 80 healthy controls, were enrolled. The levels of NLRP3, interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β), and interleukin 18 (IL-18) in EPS were detected using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Disease severity was assessed using the Bergman CP scale. Differences in EPS NLRP3 inflammasome levels between the groups were analyzed, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to investigate the clinical value of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the diagnosis of CP. The numerical rating scale (NRS), the National Institutes of Health Chronic Prostatitis Symptom Index (NIH-CPSI) and the Danish Prostatic Symptom Score (DAN-PSS-1) were applied to evaluate symptom severity. The cutoff value of NLRP3 expression was calculated using R language. NLRP3 inflammasome levels in EPS were significantly higher in CP patients of NIH-IIIA and NIH-IIIB compared to the BPH patients and controls. NLRP3 levels in EPS were positively associated with Bergman grade. In addition, NRS levels were in a positive relationship with NIH-CPSI and DAN-PSS-1. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that NLRP3 in EPS may act as a decent indicator for the diagnosis of CP/CPPS. The cutoff value of EPS NLRP3 expression was ≥55.25 ng/mL. NLRP3 levels in EPS were significantly higher in NIH-IIIA and NIH-IIIB patients compared to BPH patients and healthy controls. NLRP3 inflammasome levels in EPS may be valuable as diagnostic indicators, and targeting chemokines may present a promising approach to treatment for those suffering from CPPS.","2024","Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University"

The aim of this study is to develop generalizable machine learning (ML) algorithms to predict extended LOS following revision TKA using data from a national database. 23,656 patients undergoing revision TKA between 2013 and 2020 were identified using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. Patients with missing data and those undergoing re-revision or conversion from unicompartmental knee arthroplasty were excluded. Four ML algorithms were applied and evaluated based on their (1) ability to distinguish between at-risk and not-at-risk patients, (2) accuracy, (3) calibration, and (4) clinical utility. All four ML predictive algorithms demonstrated good accuracy, calibration, clinical utility, and discrimination, with all models achieving a similar area under the curve (AUC) (AUCLR=AUCRF=AUCHGB=0.75, AUCANN=0.74). The most important predictors of prolonged LOS were found to be operative time, preoperative diagnosis of sepsis, and body mass index (BMI). ML models developed in this study demonstrated good performance in predicting extended LOS in patients undergoing revision TKA. Our findings highlight the importance of utilizing nationally representative patient data for model development. Prolonged operative time, preoperative sepsis, BMI, and elevated preoperative serum creatinine and BUN were noted to be significant predictors of prolonged LOS. Knowledge of these associations may aid with patient-specific preoperative planning, discharge planning, patient counseling, and cost containment with revision TKA.","2024","International journal of medical informatics"

The successful combination of different brain imaging modalities using deep learning remains a challenging yet crucial research topic. The integration of structural and functional modalities is particularly important for the diagnosis of various brain disorders, where structural information plays a crucial role in diseases such as Alzheimer's, while functional imaging is more critical for disorders such as schizophrenia. However, the combination of functional and structural imaging modalities can provide a more comprehensive diagnosis. In this work, we present MultiViT, a novel diagnostic deep learning model that utilizes vision transformers and cross-attention mechanisms to effectively fuse information from 3D gray matter maps derived from structural MRI with functional network connectivity matrices obtained from functional MRI using the ICA algorithm. MultiViT achieves an AUC of 0.833, outperforming both our unimodal and multimodal baselines, enabling more accurate classification and diagnosis of schizophrenia. In addition, using vision transformer's unique attentional maps in combination with cross-attentional mechanisms and brain function information, we identify critical brain regions in 3D gray matter space associated with the characteristics of schizophrenia. Our research not only significantly improves the accuracy of AI-based automated imaging diagnostics for schizophrenia, but also pioneers a rational and advanced data fusion approach by replacing complex, high-dimensional fMRI information with functional network connectivity, integrating it with representative structural data from 3D gray matter images, and further providing interpretative biomarker localization in a 3D structural space.","2024","Human brain mapping"

Six realistic heterogeneous tumors of different characteristic spatiotemporal [18F]FDG uptake distributions for three noise levels commonly found in clinical studies and 20 noise realizations (N = 360 samples) were produced by analytic simulations of the XCAT phantom. Subsequently, DTP-Ki images were generated by performing standard linear indirect Patlak analysis with t* ≥12$ \ge 12$ -min (Patlakt* = 12) using a scaled population-based input function (sPBIF) model on 66 combinations of early and late 3-min/bed static whole-body PET reconstructed images. All DTP-Ki images were evaluated against respective DTP-Ki images estimated with Patlakt* = 12 and 0-93 min individual input functions (iIFs) and against gold standard Ki images estimated with Patlakt* = 12, 0-93 min iIFs and tissue time activity curves from all reconstructed WB passes 12-93 min post injection. The optimal combination of early and late frames, in terms of attaining the highest correlation between DTP-Ki with sPBIF and gold standard Ki was also determined from a set of 66 different combinations of 2-min early and late frames. Moreover, the performance of DTP-Ki with sPBIF was compared against that of the retention index (RI) in terms of their correlation to the gold standard Ki. Finally, the feasibility and practicality of DTP protocol in the clinic were assessed through the analysis of nine patients. High correlations (>0.9) were observed between DTP-Ki values from sPBIF and those from iIFs for all evaluated DTP protocols while the mean AUC difference between sPBIF and iIFs was less than 10%. The percentage difference of mean values between DTP-Ki from sPBIF and from iIFs was less than 1%. DTP Ki from sPBIF exhibited significantly higher correlation with gold standard Ki, in contrast to RI, across all 66 DTP protocols (p < 0.05 using the two-tailed t-test by Williams) with the highest correlation attained for the 50-53-min early + 90-93-min late scan time frames (optimal DTP protocol). Feasibility of generating Patlak Ki [18F] FDG images from an early and a late post injection 3-min/bed routine static scan using a population-based input function model was demonstrated and an optimal DTP scan protocol was determined.

A retrospective analysis was performed of patients who underwent shoulder instability surgery between September 2020 and October 2021 (arthroscopic Bankart repair or Latarjet procedure) with a minimum follow-up of 2 years. Patients were grouped according to the achievement of psychological readiness to return to play using the Shoulder Instability-Return to Sports After Injury (SIRSI) scale (≥55 points) measured at 6 months following surgery. Recurrences were measured and functional outcomes were evaluated by the visual analog scale (VAS), Rowe, and Athletic Shoulder Outcome Scoring System. The minimal clinically important difference (MCID) for the VAS and Rowe scores was calculated using the distribution-based method of a half standard deviation of the delta (difference between postoperative and preoperative scores). The patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS) for the VAS scale was set at 2.5 based on previous literature. To evaluate the predictive ability of SIRSI, a regression model analysis and a receiver operating characteristic curve were used. A total of 108 who achieved psychological readiness (PSR) and 41 who did not achieve PSR met the study criteria. PSR achieved significantly higher percentages of MCID and PASS thresholds for VAS than non-PSR (MCID: 68.5% vs 48.7%, P = .026; PASS: 92.5% vs 58.5%, P < .001). However, there were no differences in the percentage of patients achieving MCID for the Rowe score between groups (98.1% vs 100%, P = .999). The only strongest independent predictor of postoperative outcomes was being psychologically ready to return to sports. The SIRSI scale had an excellent predictive ability for recurrences (area under curve, 0.745; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.8). Of those who sustained a recurrence, 20% were not psychologically ready compared to 4.3% who were (P = .002). A power analysis was not conducted for this study. The SIRSI scale is associated with postoperative clinical outcomes and recurrences in patients who returned to sports following shoulder instability surgery. Patients who were not psychologically ready following shoulder instability surgery had worse clinical outcomes with fewer patients achieving clinically significant outcomes (PASS and MCID) for pain and a higher risk of recurrence.

We aimed to use readily available farm data to develop predictive models of pregnancy risk in dairy cows. Data from a convenience sample of 108 dairy herds in the UK were collated, and each herd was randomly allocated, at a ratio of 80:20, to either training or testing datasets. Following data cleaning, there were a total of 78 herds in the training dataset and 20 herds in the testing dataset. Data were further split by parity into nulliparous, primiparous, and multiparous subsets. An XGBoost model was trained to predict the insemination outcome in each parity subset, with predictors from farm records of breeding, calving, and milk recording. Training data comprised 74,511 inseminations in 45,909 nulliparous animals, 86,420 inseminations in 39,439 primiparous animals, and 158,294 inseminations in 32,520 multiparous animals. The final models were evaluated by predicting with the testing data, comprising 31,740 inseminations in 19,647 nulliparous animals, 38,588 inseminations in 16,215 primiparous animals, and 65,049 inseminations in 12,439 multiparous animals. Model discrimination was assessed by calculating the area under receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC); model calibration was assessed by plotting calibration curves and compared across test herds by calculating the expected calibration error (ECE) in each test herd. The models were unable to discriminate between insemination outcomes with high accuracy, with an AUC of 0.63, 0.59, and 0.62 in the nulliparous, primiparous, and multiparous subsets, respectively. The models were generally well calibrated, meaning the model-predicted pregnancy risks were similar to the observed pregnancy risks. The mean (SD) ECE in the test herds was 0.038 (0.023), 0.028 (0.012), and 0.020 (0.008) in the nulliparous, primiparous, and multiparous subsets respectively. The predictive models reported here could theoretically be used to identify subgroups of animals with similar pregnancy risk to facilitate targeted reproductive management; or provide information about cows' relative pregnancy risk compared with the herd average, which may support on-farm decision making. Further research is needed to evaluate the generalizability of these predictive models and understand the source of variation in ECE between herds; however, this study demonstrates that it is possible to accurately predict pregnancy risk in dairy cows using readily available farm data.","2024","Journal of dairy science"

We applied a data-driven method that integrates open-access remote sensing products and geospatial data, along with the first nutritional survey in the Philippines with geo-locations conducted in 2021. We used ensemble machine learning of different presence-only and presence-absence models, all subjected to hyperparameter tuning and variable decorrelation. The cross-validated ensemble model was found to have AUC=0.76-0.93 and TSS =0.45-0.81, which indicates that the models are performing better than random chance. We found that neighborhoods with (a) short distances to the main city, (b) short distances to roads, and (c) with densest road network all drive overweight-obese cases. The latter (c) contrasts the findings in Western developed countries because of delimiting factors in a tropical developing country related to active public transport, crime, weather, the walkability of roads, and even the COVID-19 restrictions during the time of the surveys.

Cardiopulmonary exercise testing and assessment of fatigue using questionnaires were performed at admission and discharge. Detailed spirometric breath-by-breath data were used to calculate substrate oxidation rates. Patients (N = 187; 38 % women; 49.7 ± 11.4 years) were referred to rehabilitation 253.4 ± 130.6 days after infection. Lead symptoms included fatigue/exercise intolerance (79.9 %), shortness of breath (77.0 %), and cognitive dysfunction (55.1 %). Fat oxidation capacity was disturbed in PCS patients overall (AUC: 11.3 [10.7-11.9]) compared to healthy controls (p < 0.0001), with hospitalization during acute infection predicting the level of disturbance (p < 0.0001). Low exercise capacity and high fatigue scores resulted in reduced fat oxidation (both p < 0.0001). In particular, younger males were affected by significantly reduced fat oxidation capacity (sex: p = 0.002; age: p < 0.001).

Sequential cranial ultrasound scans are typically used for their diagnoses. Nonetheless, manual image audit has numerous disadvantages. This study aimed to develop a predictive model utilizing modified inception (MI) and high-level feature-guided attention (HFA) modules for predicting neonatal lateral ventricular dilation via ultrasound images. The MI modules reduced input data sizes and dimensions, while the HFA modules effectively delved into semantic information through supervision from high-level feature images to low-level feature images. The process facilitated the accurate identification of dilated lateral ventricles. A total of 710 neonates, corresponding to 1420 lateral ventricles, were recruited in this study. Each lateral ventricle was captured in two images, one on the parasagittal plane and the other on the coronal plane. The combination of anterior horn width, ventricular index, thalamo-occipital distance, and ventricular height served as the gold standard. A lateral ventricle would be considered dilatated if any of these four indices exceeded its upper reference value. These lateral ventricles were randomly split into training and testing sets at a 7:3 ratio. We evaluated the validity of our proposed approach and its competitors across the coronal plane, parasagittal plane, and overall performance. We also determined the impact of subjects' baseline characteristics on the overall performance of the proposed approach. Additionally, ablation analyses were conducted to ensure the efficacy of the proposed approach. Our proposed approach achieved the largest Youden index (0.65, 95% CI: 0.58-0.72), DOR (27.11, 95% CI: 15.89-46.26), area under curves (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) (0.84, 95% CI: 0.80-0.88), and AUC of precision-recall curve (PRC) (0.81, 95% CI: 0.74-0.86) in the overall performance assessment and ablation analyses.

In this retrospective cohort study, 125 women with adenomyosis who underwent hysterectomy were screened. Tissue samples were collected from 41 patients who had undergone LNG-IUS treatment prior to surgery, and these patients were further categorized into the treatment effective group (n = 18) and the treatment failure group (n = 23) according to their self-reported relief from dysmenorrhoea after 6 months of treatment. Oestrogen receptor-α (ER-α) and progesterone receptor expression, and the extent of fibrosis in the adenomyotic lesions were measured using immunohistochemistry and Masson's trichrome staining, respectively. Patients in the treatment failure group demonstrated lower expression of ER-α and progesterone receptors, and more pronounced fibrosis in the stroma of adenomyotic lesions compared with patients in the treatment effective group. In the glandular epithelium of lesions, ER-α expression was reduced significantly in the treatment failure group, whereas no notable difference in the expression of progesterone receptors was observed. Notably, the staining intensity of ER-α in the stroma of lesions was found to have the strongest positive correlation with the degree of symptom alleviation for dysmenorrhoea (r = 0.703, P < 0.001), with an area under the curve of 0.894 for prediction. The reduced expression of steroid receptors in adenomyotic lesions, especially ER-α in the stroma, was associated with increased likelihood of treatment failure of LNG-IUS for alleviation of dysmenorrhoea.","2024","Reproductive biomedicine online"

Nevertheless, for patients with tumors located near structures such as the proximal tracheobronchial tree, esophagus, heart, spinal cord, and brachial plexus, the optimal management regimen is controversial. The objective was to develop expert multidisciplinary consensus guidelines on managing medically inoperable NSCLC located in a central or ultracentral location relative to critical organs at risk. Case variants regarding centrally and ultracentrally located lung tumors were developed by the 15-member multidisciplinary American Radium Society (ARS) Thoracic Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) expert panel. A comprehensive review of the English medical literature was performed from January 1 1946 to December 31 2023 to inform consensus guidelines. Modified Delphi methods were used by the panel to evaluate the variants and procedures, with at least three rating points from median defining agreement/consensus. The guideline was then approved by the ARS Executive Committee and released for public comment per established ARS procedures. The Thoracic ARS AUC Panel identified 90 relevant references and obtained consensus in all variants. Radiotherapy alone was considered appropriate, with additional immunotherapy to be considered primarily in the clinical trial setting. Hypofractionated radiotherapy in eight to 18 fractions was considered appropriate for ultracentral lesions near the proximal tracheobronchial tree, upper trachea, and esophagus. For other ultracentral lesions near the heart, great vessels, brachial plexus, and spine, or for non-ultracentral but still central lesions, five-fraction stereotactic body radiation therapy was also considered an appropriate option. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy was considered appropriate and three-dimensional-conformal radiotherapy inappropriate for all variants. Other treatment planning techniques to decrease the risk of overdosing critical organs at risk were also considered. The ARS Thoracic AUC panel has developed multidisciplinary consensus guidelines for various presentations of stage I NSCLC in a central or ultracentral location.","2024","Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer"

This study aims to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the accuracy of radiomics features derived from computed tomography angiography (CTA) in differentiating ruptured from unruptured IAs. A systematic search was performed across multiple databases for articles published up to January 2024. Observational studies analyzing CTA using radiomics features were included. The area under the curve (AUC) for classifying ruptured vs. unruptured IAs was pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on the use of radiomics-only features versus radiomics plus additional image-based features, as well as the type of filters used for image processing. Six studies with 4,408 patients were included. The overall pooled AUC for radiomics features in differentiating ruptured from unruptured IAs was 0.86 (95% CI: 0.84-0.88). The AUC was 0.85 (95% CI: 0.82-0.88) for studies using only radiomics features and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83-0.91) for studies incorporating radiomics plus additional image-based features. Subgroup analysis based on filter type showed an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.83-0.90) for original filters and 0.86 (95% CI: 0.81-0.90) for studies using additional filters. Radiomics-based models demonstrate very good diagnostic accuracy in classifying ruptured and unruptured IAs, with AUC values exceeding 0.8. This highlights the potential of radiomics as a useful tool in the non-invasive assessment of aneurysm rupture risk, particularly in the management of patients with multiple aneurysms.","2024","European journal of radiology"

SEs have been demonstrated as novel promising diagnostic/prognostic biomarkers and therapeutic targets across multiple human cancers. Here, we sought to develop a novel prognostic signature derived from SE-associated genes for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). SE was identified from H3K27ac ChIP-seq datasets in HNSCC cell lines by ROSE algorithm and SE-associated genes were further mapped and functionally annotated. A total number of 133 SE-associated genes with mRNA upregulation and prognostic significance was screened via differentially-expressed genes (DEGs) and Cox regression analyses. These candidates were subjected for prognostic model constructions by machine learning approaches using three independent HNSCC cohorts (TCGA-HNSC dataset as training cohort, GSE41613 and GSE42743 as validation cohorts). Among dozens of prognostic models, the random survival forest algorithm (RSF) stood out with the best performance as evidenced by the highest average concordance index (C-index). A prognostic nomogram integrating this SE-associated gene signature (SEAGS) plus tumor size demonstrated satisfactory predictive power and excellent calibration and discrimination. Moreover, WNT7A from SEARG was validated as a putative oncogene with transcriptional activation by SE to promote malignant phenotypes. Pharmacological disruption of SE functions by BRD4 or EP300 inhibitor significantly impaired tumor growth and diminished WNT7A expression in a HNSCC patient-derived xenograft model. Taken together, our results establish a novel, robust SE-derived prognostic model for HNSCC and suggest the translational potentials of SEs as promising therapeutic targets for HNSCC.","2024","Oral oncology"

However, these studies presumed that success criteria remain constant with each consecutive spinal surgery. We aimed to redefine success criteria specific for each consecutive surgery. Also, we assessed if fusion could be an effective procedure for LSS patients with previous decompression(s). We retrospectively analyzed prospectively collected patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) from surgically treated LSS patients enrolled in The NORspine Register. Patients operated for lumbar spinal stenosis. PROMs: Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) percentage (%) change and Global Perceived Effect (GPE). We categorized the LSS cohort by number of previous spine surgeries (none to ≥3). ROC analyses gave the most accurate cut-offs for ODI% change that corresponded to success, anchored by GPE, ie, ""much improved"" and ""completely recovered"". Areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) indicated how well ODI discriminated between success and nonsuccess for each consecutive surgery: good (0.8-0.89) and excellent (0.9-0.99). We then calculated proportions of successfully treated patients by number of consecutive surgeries. We also analyzed whether fusion succeeded in patients with previous lumbar decompression(s). At 12 months, 8,919 (75%) responded; 6,961 (78%) had no previous LSS surgery, 1,338 (15%) had one, 417 (5%) had 2, and 203 (2%) had ≥3 previous surgeries. Preoperative ODI (95% CI) was 38.7 (38.2-39.1) for no previous surgery versus 49.4 (46.9-51.9) for patients with ≥3 previous surgeries. The postoperative ODIs (95% CI) were 21.9 (21.4-22.4) and 37.9 (34.9-40.8) for patients with no and ≥3 previous surgeries, respectively. For patients with no previous surgeries, ODI% change of 37.6% most accurately defined success (AUC [95% CI]=0.909 [0.903-0.916]), and 57.1% reported success. For patients with ≥3 previous surgeries, success was an ODI% change of 25.0% (AUC [95%CI]=0.930 [0.890-0.971]), and 46.3% reported success. Finally, 350 patients received fusion after previous decompression(s). ODI% change of 34.6% defined success (AUC [95% CI]=0.920 [0.890-0.949]). The proportion of successfully treated fusion patients was 47.7%, compared to 54.3% for the entire cohort. We redefined ODI success criteria for patients with consecutive lumbar spinal stenosis surgeries. Our register study found the detrimental effect of consecutive surgeries on success rates to be less pessimistic than previously reported; fusion may be an effective option for LSS patients with previous decompression.","2024","The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society"

Variant classification is difficult, often because of lack of functional data. Moreover, variant-based risk stratification is also complicated by heterogenous clinical data and incomplete penetrance. Here we sought to test whether variant-specific information, primarily from high-throughput functional assays, could improve both classification and cardiac event risk stratification in a large, harmonized cohort of KCNH2 missense variant heterozygotes. We quantified cell-surface trafficking of 18 796 variants in KCNH2 using a multiplexed assay of variant effect (MAVE). We recorded KCNH2 current density for 533 variants by automated patch clamping. We calibrated the strength of evidence of MAVE data according to ClinGen guidelines. We deeply phenotyped 1458 patients with KCNH2 missense variants, including QTc, cardiac event history, and mortality. We correlated variant functional data and Bayesian long QT syndrome penetrance estimates with cohort phenotypes and assessed hazard ratios for cardiac events. Variant MAVE trafficking scores and automated patch clamping peak tail currents were highly correlated (Spearman rank-order ρ=0.69; n=433). The MAVE data were found to provide up to pathogenic very strong evidence for severe loss-of-function variants. In the cohort, both functional assays and Bayesian long QT syndrome penetrance estimates were significantly predictive of cardiac events when independently modeled with patient sex and corrected QT interval (QTc); however, MAVE data became nonsignificant when peak tail current and penetrance estimates were also available. The area under the receiver operator characteristic curve for 20-year event outcomes based on patient-specific sex and QTc (area under the curve, 0.80 [0.76-0.83]) was improved with prospectively available penetrance scores conditioned on MAVE (area under the curve, 0.86 [0.83-0.89]) or attainable automated patch clamping peak tail current data (area under the curve, 0.84 [0.81-0.88]). High-throughput KCNH2 variant MAVE data meaningfully contribute to variant classification at scale, whereas long QT syndrome penetrance estimates and automated patch clamping peak tail current measurements meaningfully contribute to risk stratification of cardiac events in patients with heterozygous KCNH2 missense variants.","2024","Circulation"

This was a retrospective prognostic study using data from 8 public tertiary hospitals in China from 2018. The data were randomly divided into a development set and a validation set. Simple, improved and extended models predicting adverse outcomes were developed, with adverse outcomes defined as in-hospital death or ICU transfer, and patient clinical characteristics, vital signs, diagnoses, and laboratory test values as predictors. The results of the models were presented in the form of nomograms, and performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC), precision-recall (PR) curves (PR-AUC), Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Our final dataset consisted of 18,629 patients (40.2% female, mean age of 52.3), 1,089 (5.85%) of whom resulted in adverse outcomes.

Therefore, we sought to investigate the prognostic utility of a multi-biomarker panel with 29 different biomarkers in in 748 consecutive patients with symptoms indicative of MI using a machine learning-based approach. Incident major cardiovascular events (MACE) were documented within 1 year after the index admission. The selection of the best multi-biomarker model was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). The independent and additive utility of selected biomarkers was compared to a clinical reference model and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) Score, respectively. Findings were validated using internal cross-validation. Median age of the study population was 64 years. At 1 year of follow-up, 160 cases of incident MACE were documented. 16 of the investigated 29 biomarkers were significantly associated with 1-year MACE. Three biomarkers including NT-proBNP (HR per SD 1.24), Apolipoprotein A-I (Apo A-I; HR per SD 0.98) and kidney injury molecule-1 (KIM-1; HR per SD 1.06) were identified as independent predictors of 1-year MACE. Although the discriminative ability of the selected multi-biomarker model was rather moderate, the addition of these biomarkers to the clinical reference model and the GRACE score improved model performances markedly (∆C-index 0.047 and 0.04, respectively). NT-proBNP, Apo A-I and KIM-1 emerged as strongest independent predictors of 1-year MACE in patients with suspected MI. Their integration into clinical risk prediction models may improve personalized risk stratification.","2024","Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society"

Regions of interest were delineated using ITK-SNAP, with peritumoral regions of 2 mm, 4 mm, and 6 mm automatically expanded using code from the Pyradiomic package. Feature extraction was subsequently performed using Pyradiomics. The study employed Z-score normalization, Spearman correlation for feature correlation, and LASSO regression for feature selection, validated through 10-fold cross-validation. The radiomics model integrated intra and peri-tumoral area, evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve(ROC), Calibration and Decision Curve Analysis(DCA). We extracted and selected features from intratumoral and peritumoral PA/US images regions at 2 mm, 4 mm, and 6 mm. The comprehensive radiomics model, integrating these regions, demonstrated enhanced diagnostic performance, especially the 4 mm model which showed the highest area under the curve(AUC):0.898(0.78-1.00) and comparably high accuracy (0.900) and sensitivity (0.937). This model outperformed the standalone clinical model and combined clinical-radiomics model in distinguishing between Luminal and non-Luminal BC, as evidenced in the test set results. This study developed a radiomics model integrating intratumoral and peritumoral at 4 mm region PA/US model, enhancing the differentiation of Luminal from non-Luminal BC.

Recently, computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) using deep learning has been applied in the field of medical science, and high diagnostic accuracy has been reported. We aimed to develop a deep learning-based CAD system for OCD detection on ultrasound images and to evaluate the accuracy of OCD detection using the CAD system. The CAD process comprises 2 steps: humeral capitellum detection using an object-detection algorithm and OCD classification using an image classification network. Four-directional ultrasound images of the elbow of the throwing arm of 196 baseball players (mean age, 11.2 years), including 104 players with normal findings and 92 with OCD, were used for training and validation. An external dataset of 20 baseball players (10 with normal findings and 10 with OCD) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the CAD system. A confusion matrix and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the system. Clinical evaluation using the external dataset resulted in high AUCs in all 4 directions: 0.969 for the anterior long axis, 0.966 for the anterior short axis, 0.996 for the posterior long axis, and 0.993 for the posterior short axis. The accuracy of OCD detection thus exceeded 0.9 in all 4 directions. We propose a deep learning-based CAD system to detect OCD lesions on ultrasound images. The CAD system achieved high accuracy in all 4 directions of the elbow.

The GLIM criteria need confirmed validation before being widely used in each population or healthcare system. This study aimed to investigate the validation of the GLIM criteria for malnutrition diagnosis in hospitalized patients. The content validity was assessed by calculating the content validity ratio (CVR) and content validity index (CVI). Subjective global assessment (SGA) is considered the reference tool to diagnose malnutrition in concurrent validation. In addition, the Kuder-Richardson 20 was used to evaluate the reliability of the GLIM criteria. Furthermore, hospital mortality, length of hospitalization (LOS), prolonged hospital stays (LOS >6 days), 30-day hospital readmission, and 30- and 60-day mortality were identified as malnutrition-related outcomes in predictive validity. A total of 332 adult/elderly hospitalized patients (median age: 58 (IQR: 24.7), 60.5% men) were enrolled to present the study. Appling GLIM criteria by considering the calf circumference < 31 cm in both genders or mid-upper arm (MUAC) < 23 cm in men and MUAC <22 cm in women as reduced muscle mass had an appropriate accuracy (84.6 and 83.4%, respectively), good ability to distinguish malnourished patients (AUC ROC: 0.85 and 0.83, respectively), satisfactory sensitivity (89.58 and 84.02%, respectively), and satisfactory specificity (81 and 83%, respectively) compared to the SGA tool. Furthermore, the reliability of the GLIM criteria for malnutrition diagnosis in hospitalized patients was acceptable in all 3 applied approaches (KR-20 > 0.5). The malnutrition diagnosed by GLIM criteria could significantly predict the odds of prolonged hospital stays, 30-day hospital readmission, and 60-day mortality, while it had no significant association with the risk of hospital mortality.

Patients who underwent UAE for adenomyosis at institution A between November 2015 and June 2018 were included in the training cohort and those at institution B between June 2017 and June 2019 were included in the test cohort. The regions of interest (ROI) were manually segmented on the T2-weighted images (T2WI). The ROIs were subsequently partitioned into habitat subregions using k-means clustering. Radiomic features were extracted from each subregion on T1WI, T2WI, apparent diffusion coefficient, and contrast-enhanced images. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to select the subregion radiomics features. With the improvement in patients' symptoms at 36 months post-UAE, the habitat subregion features were trained using six machine-learning classifiers. The most suitable classifier was chosen based on model performance to establish the habitat radiomics model (HRM). The efficacy of the model was validated using both the training and test cohorts. Finally, a whole-region radiomics model (WRM) and clinical model (CM) were established. The Delong test was used to compare the predictive performance of the habitat subregion model and the two other models. The study included 258 patients, 191 in the training cohort and 67 in the test cohort. The ROIs were divided into four habitat subregions. Radiomics features were extracted from different sequence images of the subregions. After LASSO regression, 24 habitat subregion features were included in the model. Based on the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) of the HRM was 0.921 (95% CI, 0.857-0.985, training) and 0.890 (95% CI, 0.736-1.000, test). The AUCs for the WRM were 0.805 (95% CI, 0.737-0.872, training) and 0.693 (95% CI, 0.497-0.889, test). Compared to the HRM, the difference in predictive performance was statistically significant (p = 0.008, training; p = 0.007, test).

Multivariate logistic regression analysis and multiple linear regression analysis were carried out to select independent risk factors of CAS severity in hypertension. A predictive equation was conducted according to the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis to make clinical practice easier. As the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve had been plotted, the predictive ability of endothelial function and limb artery indicators in CAS severity in hypertension was detected by the area under the curve (AUC). In patients with hypertension, the FMD (p = 0.023), ABI (p < 0.001) and baPWV (p < 0.001) of CHD patients appeared substantially different from the non-CHD patients. Furthermore, the ABI (p < 0.001) and baPWV (p = 0.032) both independently associated with CAS severity in hypertensive patients with CHD. Based on the results of multivariate logistic regression analysis with CAS severity as a dependent variable, a predictive equation of baPWV, ABI and FMD was developed: combined coefficient = Logit(p)=5.531-0.218*FMD-7.019*ABI + 0.244*baPWV. From the combined coefficients of baPWV, ABI and FMD, the largest AUC was 0.800, suggesting a powerful predictive value of CAS severity in hypertensive patients, followed by ABI (AUC = 0.747, 95%CI 0.693-0.796), baPWV (AUC = 0.704, 95%CI 0.648-0.756) and FMD (AUC = 0.588, 95%CI 0.529-0.645). This study shows that baPWV, ABI and FMD are independent risk factors for CHD, of which, baPWV and ABI are strongly associated with CAS severity in hypertensive patients. The predictive ability of CHD in hypertensive patients may be enhanced through combining the three endothelial function and limb artery indicators. The results may help to facilitate clinical decision-making during treatment and management of coronary artery disease.","2024","Annals of medicine"
370,"39471592","Development and validation of a potential risk area identification model for hand, foot, and mouth disease in metropolitan China.","Maximum Entropy model (MaxEnt), as a machine learning algorithm, is widely used to identify potential risk areas for emerging infectious diseases. However, MaxEnt usually overlooks the influence of the optimal selection of spatial grid scale and the optimal combination of factor information on identification accuracy. Furthermore, the internal level information of factors is closely related to the potential risk of disease occurrence but is rarely applied to enhance MaxEnt's accuracy. In this study, the Optimal Parameters-based Geographical Detectors-Information Value-MaxEnt (OPGD-IV-MaxEnt) was first proposed to identify the potential risk areas of hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) in Shenzhen and compared its identification accuracy with that of OPGD-MaxEnt and MaxEnt. Firstly, the optimal grid scale and optimal combination of factor information were determined by OPGD. Secondly, the contributions of factors' internal level information to the potential risk of HFMD occurrence were quantified and incorporated by IV. Lastly, the spatial patterns of potential risk areas and their main driving factors were elucidated. Results showed that: (i) Area under the curve (AUC) of single MaxEnt were 0.638, 0.688, 0.763, 0.796, and 0.757 at 100 m, 250 m, 500 m, 750 m, and 1000 m scale, respectively, and 750 m were deemed the optimal scale. (ii) At the optimal scale, OPGD-IV-MaxEnt (AUC = 0.868) identified potential risk areas more accurately than MaxEnt (AUC = 0.796) and OPGD-MaxEnt (AUC = 0.827). (iii) Resident (r = 0.61, q = 0.39) and Market (r = 0.61, q = 0.36) were the primary factors affecting the identification of potential risk areas. (iv) Potential high-risk areas of HFMD were mainly distributed in northwestern, southwestern, and central Shenzhen, with dense resident and market distribution. Such insights are instrumental in devising targeted infection prevention and control measures for emerging infectious diseases and provide references for improving the identification accuracy of similar machine learning algorithms.","2024","Journal of environmental management"

Studies of children (up to age 21) with a clinical suspicion of OCD that evaluated the accuracy (predictive validity) of brief assessment tools for OCD, compared to a reference standard. We extracted participant characteristics, scale and reference standard information, results, and risk of bias assessment. We performed random-effects diagnostic meta-analysis where feasible. We assessed strength of evidence for each scale. There is moderate strength of evidence that the 8-question version of the Child Behavior Checklist-Obsessive Compulsive subscale is sufficiently sensitive and specific (summary area under the curve of 0.84, 95% CI 0.74 to 0.91) to prompt specialist referral for additional diagnostic assessment. Other tools may perform as well or better, but the current evidence is insufficient to justify broad conclusions about their performance. Few studies per scale, case-control studies, and homogenous White populations may preclude generalizability of tool performance. Based on the current evidence the CBCL-OCS probably is sufficiently accurate to indicate which youth should be further evaluated for OCD, but further research is needed to establish that the 8-question subscale can function as a stand-alone measure. The available evidence is insufficient for other brief assessment tools.","2024","Pediatrics"
372,"39430403","Using AI-predicted protein structures as a reference to predict loss-of-function activity in tumor suppressor breast cancer genes.","The loss-of-function (LOF) classification of most missense variants in tumor suppressor breast cancer genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, and RAD51C remains unclassified and confounds clinical actionability. Classifying these variants is challenging due to their rarity, leading clinicians to rely on in silico predictive methods. Protein stability changes are associated with function, making stability predictors valuable. Stability predictions upon missense variant perturbations require high-resolution protein structures. However, the availability of these high-resolution structures is lacking. This study explores using generative AI to predict high-resolution protein structures, which can then be analyzed with in silico protein stability prediction methods to assess LOF activity in ordered regions of the protein. This study also determines the appropriate in silico protein stability and dedicated in silico missense prediction methods in dbNSFP v4.7 database to predict LOF activity in ordered regions of these four genes. Functional classifications from homology recombination DNA repair (HDR) assays and variant classifications from the ClinVar database provide a reliable dataset for evaluating the performance of these in silico prediction methods. Complex AlphaFold2 structures of the BRCA1-C terminal (BRCT) domain and the DNA-binding (DB) domain of BRCA2, analyzed using protein stability tool FoldX predicts LOF activity from missense variants significantly better than experimentally-derived structures in ordered regions. The BRCT domain achieved an Area Under the Curve (AUC)= 0.861 (95 % CI:0.858-0.863) and AUC= 0.842 (95 % CI:0.840-0.845), while the DB domain achieved an AUC= 0.836 (95 % CI:0.8322-0.841), compared to AUC= 0.847 (95 % CI:0.844-0.850) and AUC= 0.835 (95 % CI:0.832-0.837) from the BRCT domain, and AUC= 0.830 (95 % CI:0.821-0.8320) from the DB domain from experimentally-derived structures. Protein stability does not predict LOF activity from missense variants better than dedicated in silico missense predictors. Overall, we find that AlphaMissense ranks highly, with an average AUC= 0.890 (95 % CI 0.886-0.895) from ordered regions across these four cancer genes, compared to all other in silico missense predictors present in the dbNSFP database. The study reveals that generative AI protein predicted structures can outperform experimentally-derived structures in evaluating LOF activity from predicted protein stability in ordered regions of genes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2 and RAD51C. The study also highlights the predictive performance of AlphaMissense as the premier in silico missense prediction method to predict LOF activity from missense variants in these four tumor suppressor breast cancer genes.

This is a retrospective cohort analysis of prospectively collected data from 15 NICHD Neonatal Research Network centers. Neonatal morbidities and 2-year outcomes were examined for 3794 infants born at 22 to 26 weeks' gestation from 2014 through 2019 who survived to 36 weeks' PMA. Serious brain injury (SBI), bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), and severe retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) had the strongest bivariate associations with death or sNDI (ORs, 95% CI): 3.96 (3.39, 4.64), 3.41 (2.94, 3.95), and 2.66 (2.28, 3.11)], respectively. A morbidity count variable was constructed using these morbidities. The estimated ORs and 95% CI for death or sNDI with any 1, any 2, or all 3 of these morbidities, adjusted for maternal and infant characteristics and hospital of birth, increased from 2.75 (2.25, 3.37) to 6.10 (4.83, 7.70) to 12.90 (9.07, 18.36), respectively. Corresponding rates of late death or sNDI with none, any 1, any 2, and all 3 morbidities were 12.6%, 30.3%, 51.9%, and 69.9%, respectively.

Developing a suitable predictive model for NSSI is crucial for early identification and intervention. This study included 2090 Chinese rural children and adolescents. Participants' sociodemographic information, symptoms of anxiety as well as depression, personality traits, family environment and NSSI behaviors were collected through a questionnaire survey. Gender, age, grade, and all survey results except sociodemographic information were used as relevant factors for prediction. Support vector machines, decision tree and random forest models were trained and validated by the train set and valid set, respectively. The metrics of each model were tested and compared to select the most suitable one. Furthermore, the mean decrease Gini index was calculated to measure the importance of relevant factors. The prevalence of NSSI was 38.3%. Out of the 6 models assessed, the random forest model demonstrated the highest suitability in predicting the prevalence of NSSI. It achieved sensitivity, specificity, AUC, accuracy, precision, and F1 scores of 0.65, 0.72, 0.76, 0.70, 0.57, and 0.61, respectively. Anxiety and depression were the top two contributing factors in the prediction model. Neuroticism and conflict were the factors that contributed the most to personality traits and family environment, respectively, in terms of prediction. In addition, demographic factors contributed little to the prediction in this study. This study focused on Chinese children and adolescents in rural areas and demonstrated the potential of using machine learning approaches in predicting NSSI.

Canine oral melanoma (COM) frequently metastasizes, and ncRNA expression under hypoxia may be clinically significant. We aimed to elucidate ncRNA fragments whose expression is altered by hypoxia in COM-derived primary KMeC and metastatic LMeC cell lines using next-generation sequencing to validate these results in qRT-PCR, and then compare expression between metastatic and non-metastatic COM. The NGS analysis and subsequent qRT-PCR validation were performed using hypoxic and normoxic KMeC and LMeC cells, and clinical samples [tumor tissue, plasma, and plasma-derived extracellular vesicles] obtained from dogs with metastatic or non-metastatic melanoma were analyzed with qRT-PCR. Y RNA was significantly decreased in metastatic LMeC cells versus primary KMeC cells in hypoxic and normoxic conditions. The expression of Y RNA was decreased in dogs with metastatic melanoma versus those with non-metastatic melanoma for all clinical sample types, reflecting the pattern found with hypoxia. Receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated that Y RNA level is a promising biomarker for discriminating metastatic from non-metastatic melanoma in plasma [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.993, p < 0.0001] and plasma-derived extracellular vesicles (AUC = 0.981, p = 0.0002). Overall, Y RNA may be more resistant to hypoxic stress in the metastatic than the non-metastatic state for COM.

Expanding the surgical resection margin and performing anatomical liver resection may improve outcomes in patients with MVI. However, no reliable preoperative method currently exists to predict MVI status or to identify patients at high-risk group (M2). To develop and validate models based on contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) radiomics and clinicoradiological factors to predict MVI and identify M2 among patients with hepatitis B virus-related HCC (HBV-HCC). The ultimate goal of the study was to guide surgical decision-making. A total of 270 patients who underwent surgical resection were retrospectively analyzed. The cohort was divided into a training dataset (189 patients) and a validation dataset (81) with a 7:3 ratio. Radiomics features were selected using intra-class correlation coefficient analysis, Pearson or Spearman's correlation analysis, and the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm, leading to the construction of radscores from CECT images. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified significant clinicoradiological factors and radscores associated with MVI and M2, which were subsequently incorporated into predictive models. The models' performance was evaluated using calibration, discrimination, and clinical utility analysis. Independent risk factors for MVI included non-smooth tumor margins, absence of a peritumoral hypointensity ring, and a high radscore based on delayed-phase CECT images. The MVI prediction model incorporating these factors achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.841 in the training dataset and 0.768 in the validation dataset. The M2 prediction model, which integrated the radscore from the 5 mm peritumoral area in the CECT arterial phase, α-fetoprotein level, enhancing capsule, and aspartate aminotransferase level achieved an AUC of 0.865 in the training dataset and 0.798 in the validation dataset. Calibration and decision curve analyses confirmed the models' good fit and clinical utility. Multivariable models were constructed by combining clinicoradiological risk factors and radscores to preoperatively predict MVI and identify M2 among patients with HBV-HCC. Further studies are needed to evaluate the practical application of these models in clinical settings.","2024","World journal of gastroenterology"

This study evaluates the effect of hair presence in dermoscopic images on AI-driven skin lesion recognition, using 10,015 images from the HAM10000 collection. Images were categorized based on the extent of hair occlusions to assess their impact on AI performance. Advanced metrics like Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping and novel infection metrics provided deeper insights into the model's focus and segmentation efficacy. The results revealed that the AI model achieved an impressive overall accuracy of 95.3 % and an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.1 %, maintaining high performance across various lesion types. Performance varied with hair occlusion levels; it was optimal under few hair occlusions but dropped significantly when hair was abundant. For instance, Vascular Lesions saw a dramatic decrease in performance metrics from 0.515 to 0.115 under heavy hair occlusion, while Actinic Keratoses and Intraepithelial Carcinoma were least affected. Sparse hair occasionally improved accuracy, suggesting its potential utility in training robust models. The study underscores the complex impact of hair on AI diagnostics in dermatology, advocating for the development of advanced preprocessing techniques and hair-robust algorithms to enhance AI diagnostic capabilities.","2024","Computers in biology and medicine"

However, the mechanisms underlying its onset and progression remain unclear, and effective therapeutic targets are lacking. Therefore, we employs an innovative approach by combining single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) with meta-analysis. This not only elucidates the potential mechanisms of psoriasis at the cellular level but also identifies immunoregulatory marker genes that play a statistically significant role in driving psoriasis progression through comprehensive analysis of multiple datasets. Skin tissue samples from 12 psoriasis patients underwent scRNA-seq, followed by quality control, filtering, PCA dimensionality reduction, and tSNE clustering analysis to identify T cell subtypes and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in psoriatic skin tissue. Next, three psoriasis datasets were standardised and merged to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Subsequently, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was applied for clustering analysis of gene co-expression network modules and to assess the correlation between these modules and DEGs. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were conducted to select disease-specific genes and evaluate their diagnostic value. Single-cell data revealed nine cell types in psoriatic skin tissue, with seven T cell subtypes identified. Intersection analysis identified ADAM8 and G3BP2 as key genes. Through the integration of scRNA-seq and Meta analysis, we identified the immunoregulatory marker gene G3BP2, which is associated with the onset and progression of psoriasis and holds clinical significance. G3BP2 is speculated to promote the development of psoriasis by increasing the proportion of CD8+ T cells.","2024","Immunology"

Our study addresses this gap by evaluating the effectiveness of such strategies in Chinese women, thereby enriching the evidence base for identifying the most efficacious screening approaches for women with dense breast tissue. Conducted from October 2018 to August 2022 in Central China, this prospective cohort study enrolled 8996 women aged 35-64 years, divided into two age groups (35-44 and 45-64 years). Participants were screened for breast cancer using hand-held ultrasound (HHUS) and automated breast ultrasound system (ABUS), with the older age group also receiving full-field digital mammography (FFDM). The Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) was employed for image interpretation, with abnormal results indicated by BI-RADS 4/5, necessitating a biopsy; BI-RADS 3 required follow-up within 6-12 months by primary screening strategies; and BI-RADS 1/2 were classified as negative. Among the screened women, 29 cases of breast cancer were identified, with 4 (1.3‰) in the 35-44 years age group and 25 (4.2‰) in the 45-64 years age group. In the younger age group, HHUS and ABUS performed equally well, with no significant difference in their AUC values (0.8678 vs. 0.8679, P > 0.05). For the older age group, ABUS as a standalone strategy (AUC 0.9935) and both supplemental screening methods (HHUS with FFDM, AUC 0.9920; ABUS with FFDM, AUC 0.9928) outperformed FFDM alone (AUC 0.8983, P < 0.05). However, there was no significant difference between HHUS alone and FFDM alone (AUC 0.9529 vs. 0.8983, P > 0.05). The findings indicate that both HHUS and ABUS exhibit strong performance as independent breast cancer screening strategies, with ABUS demonstrating superior potential. However, the integration of FFDM with these ultrasound techniques did not confer a substantial improvement in the overall effectiveness of the screening process.","2024","Academic radiology"

Lymph node status (LNs) is particularly important for planning treatment and evaluating the prognosis of patients with AEJ. However, the use of radiomic based on enhanced computed tomography (CT) to predict the preoperative lymph node metastasis (PLNM) status of the AEJ has yet to be reported. We sought to investigate the value of radiomic features based on enhanced CT in the accurate prediction of PLNM in patients with AEJ. Clinical features and enhanced CT data of 235 patients with AEJ from October 2017 to May 2023 were retrospectively analyzed. The data were randomly assigned to the training cohort (n = 164) or the external testing cohort (n = 71) at a ratio of 7:3. A CT-report model, clinical model, radiomic model, and radiomic-clinical combined model were developed to predict PLNM in patients with AEJ. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used to screen for independent clinical risk factors. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used to select the radiomic features. Finally, a nomogram for the preoperative prediction of PLNM in AEJ was constructed by combining Radiomics-score and clinical risk factors. The models were evaluated by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analyses. A total of 181 patients (181/235, 77.02%) had LNM.

OSA severity was categorized using these tests, and potential predictors were identified using multivariable logistic regression. The outcomes of the tests were used to create a risk-based scoring system. Internal validation was performed using bootstrapping procedures. Out of the 1,327 participants, 882 individuals (66.5%) were diagnosed with moderate-to-severe OSA. Predictors considered for developing the scoring system included Craniofacial abnormalities, adenotonsillar Hypertrophy, Age 1-5 years, Snoring > 5 nights/week, Excessive daytime sleepiness, Obesity, Stopping breathing, and Awakening during sleep (CHASE-OSA). The scoring system developed demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.83-0.88).

Our aim was to evaluate the comparative prognostic and predictive performance of different ROR classifiers in a real-world LA cohort. The Molecular Profile of Breast Cancer Study (MPBCS) is an LA case-cohort study with 5-year follow-up. Stages I and II, clinically node-negative HR+HER2- patients (n = 340) who received adjuvant hormone therapy and/or chemotherapy, were analyzed. Time-dependent receiver-operator characteristic-area under the curve, univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression (CPHR) models were used to compare the prognostic performance of several risk biomarkers. Multivariate CPHR with interaction models tested the predictive ability of selected risk classifiers. Within this cohort, transcriptomic-based classifiers such as the recurrence score (RS), EndoPredict (EP risk and EPClin), and PAM50-risk of recurrence scores (ROR-S and ROR-PC) presented better prognostic performances for node-negative patients (univariate C-index 0.61-0.68, adjusted C-index 0.77-0.80, adjusted hazard ratios [HR] between high and low risk: 4.06-9.97) than the traditional classifiers Ki67 and Nottingham Prognostic Index (univariate C-index 0.53-0.59, adjusted C-index 0.72-0.75, and adjusted HR 1.85-2.54). RS (and to some extent, EndoPredict) also showed predictive capacity for chemotherapy benefit in node-negative patients (interaction P = .0200 and .0510, respectively).

We included (1) patients with PsA taking tumor necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi), interleukin 17 inhibitors (IL-17i), methotrexate (MTX), and those who were untreated with bDMARDs or csDMARDs; (2) patients with PsC taking bDMARDs; and (3) matched patients with PsC who were not treated with bDMARDs or csDMARDs. Serum samples at baseline and at the 3- to 6-month follow-up visit were retrieved from the biobank. Protein levels were quantified using a Luminex multiplex assay. We compared follow-up vs baseline protein levels within groups and change in levels between groups. For the predictive potential of the biomarkers, we developed logistic regression classification models. Response to treatment was defined as (1) achieving low disease activity or remission (according to the Disease Activity Index for Psoriatic Arthritis); (2) ≥ 75% reduction in Psoriasis Area and Severity Index; and (3) ≥ 50% reduction in actively inflamed joint count. In PsA, TNFi reduced serum levels of all 5 proteins, IL-17i increased ACP5 and CCL2, and MTX reduced MMP3. Changes in MMP3 and S100A8 levels were significantly different between untreated PsA and matched biologic-treated PsA (P < 0.05). There were no significant differences between treated or untreated patients with PsC. Baseline levels of CXCL10, MMP3, S100A8, and ACP5 had good predictive value (area under the curve > 0.80) for response to biologics in patients with PsA.

However, the relationship between sACR and pulmonary infection during hospitalization in patients with STEMI undergoing PCI remains unclear. A total of 4,507 patients with STEMI undergoing PCI were enrolled and divided into three groups according to sACR tertile. The primary outcome was pulmonary infection during hospitalization, and the secondary outcome was in-hospital major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) including stroke, in-hospital mortality, target vessel revascularization, recurrent myocardial infarction, and all-cause mortality during follow-up. Overall, 522 (11.6%) patients developed pulmonary infections, and 223 (4.9%) patients developed in-hospital MACE. Cubic spline models indicated a non-linear, L-shaped relationship between sACR and pulmonary infection (P=0.039). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that sACR had good predictive value for both pulmonary infection (area under the ROC curve [AUC]=0.73, 95% CI=0.70-0.75, P＜0.001) and in-hospital MACE (AUC=0.72, 95% CI=0.69-0.76, P＜0.001). Kaplan-Meier survival analysis indicated that higher sACR tertiles were associated with a greater cumulative survival rate (P＜0.001). Cox regression analysis identified lower sACR as an independent predictor of long-term all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR]=0.96, 95% CI=0.95-0.98, P＜0.001). A low sACR was significantly associated with elevated risk of pulmonary infection and MACE during hospitalization, as well as all-cause mortality during follow-up among patients with STEMI undergoing PCI. These findings highlighted sACR as an important prognostic marker in this patient population.","2024","Journal of atherosclerosis and thrombosis"

ChatGPT-4 is a highly advanced AI model with multimodal capabilities, allowing it to process text and statistical data. Osteoporosis is a chronic condition presenting asymptomatically but leading to fractures if untreated. Current diagnostic methods like dual X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) are costly and involve radiation exposure. This study aims to develop a cost-effective osteoporosis risk prediction tool using ophthalmological data and ChatGPT-4 based on oculomics, aligning with predictive, preventive, and personalized medicine (3PM) principles. We hypothesize that leveraging ophthalmological data (oculomics) combined with AI-driven regression models developed by ChatGPT-4 can significantly improve the predictive accuracy for osteoporosis risk. This integration will facilitate earlier detection, enable more effective preventive strategies, and support personalized treatment plans tailored to individual patients. We utilized DXA and ophthalmological data from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to develop and validate osteopenia and osteoporosis prediction models. Ophthalmological and demographic data were integrated into logistic regression analyses, facilitated by ChatGPT-4, to create prediction formulas. These models were then converted into calculator software through automated coding by ChatGPT-4. ChatGPT-4 automatically developed prediction models based on key predictors of osteoporosis and osteopenia included age, gender, weight, and specific ophthalmological conditions such as cataracts and early age-related macular degeneration, and successfully implemented a risk calculator tool. The oculomics-based models outperformed traditional methods, with area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic values of 0.785 for osteopenia and 0.866 for osteoporosis in the validation set. The calculator demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity, providing a reliable tool for early osteoporosis screening. This study illustrates the value of integrating ophthalmological data into multi-level diagnostics for osteoporosis, significantly improving the accuracy of health risk assessment and the identification of at-risk individuals. Aligned with the principles of 3PM, this approach fosters earlier detection and enables the development of individualized patient profiles, facilitating personalized and targeted treatment strategies. This study also highlights the potential of AI, specifically ChatGPT-4, in developing accessible, cost-effective, and radiation-free screening tools for advancing 3PM in clinical practice. Our findings emphasize the importance of a holistic approach, incorporating comprehensive health indices and interdisciplinary collaboration, to deliver personalized management plans. Preventive strategies should focus on lifestyle modifications and targeted interventions to enhance bone health, thereby preventing the progression of osteoporosis and contributing to overall patient well-being.

However, ECMO remains a resource-intensive modality, and identifying patients most likely to benefit from it can be a complex task. Few methods exist to help risk stratify potential ECMO patients. Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) and soluble thrombomodulin (sTM) are markers of endothelial dysfunction and are used as a sign of disease severity in various forms of trauma. Our study aims to evaluate the association between precannulation levels of SDC-1 and sTM with mortality, current scoring systems, and their ability to predict mortality on ECMO. Patients initiated on venoarterial ECMO were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical data were collected, and precannulation Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation scores were calculated. Blood samples from precannulation collection were assayed for SDC-1 and sTM by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. The primary outcome was mortality on ECMO. Thirty-four patients were included in the analysis. Most were male (76.5%), with a median age of 61.5 y and body mass index of 28.2. Overall mortality was 61.7%. sTM was significantly higher in patients who died on venoarterial ECMO compared to those who lived. Pre-SDC-1 level of ≥951 ng/mL is marginally predictive of a higher mortality risk (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.70; P = 0.070). Pre-sTM levels of ≥5348 pg/mL predicted mortality (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve 0.89; P = 0.003). SDC-1 and sTM are associated with a higher mortality risk in patients on ECMO. These biomarkers may be a valuable addition to current scoring systems. Furthermore, more work should focus on characterizing the effects of cardiogenic shock on the endothelium.","2024","The Journal of surgical research"

We tested its diagnostic performance in accurately predicting LNI in breast cancer (BC) patients with magnetic resonance imaging. The study also explores the consistency of the score across three readers. A retrospective study was conducted on BC patients who underwent preoperative breast contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging and lymph node dissection between January 2020 and January 2023. Sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value were calculated for different Node-RADS cut-off values. Pathologic results were considered the gold standard. The overall diagnostic performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC). A logistic regression analysis was performed. Cohen's Kappa analysis was used for inter-reader agreement. The final population includes 192 patients and a total of 1134 lymph nodes analyzed (372 metastatic and 762 benign). Increasing the Node-RADS cut-off values, specificity and PPV rose from 71.4% to 100% and 76.7% to 100%, respectively, for Reader 1, 69.4% to 100% and 74.6% to 100% for Reader 2, and from 64.3% to 100% and 72% to 100% for Reader 3. Node-RADS > 2 could be considered the best cut-off value due to its balanced performance. Node-RADS exhibited a similar AUC for the three readers (0.97, 0.93, and 0.93). An excellent inter-reader agreement was found (Kappa values between 0.71 and 0.83). The Node-RADS score demonstrated moderate-to-high overall accuracy in identifying LNI in patients with BC, suggesting that the scoring system can aid in the identification of suspicious lymph nodes and facilitate appropriate treatment decisions. Node-RADS > 2 can be considered the best cut-off for discriminating malignant nodes, suggesting that the scoring system can effectively help identify suspicious lymph nodes by staging the disease and providing a global standardized language for clear communication. Axillary lymphadenopathies in breast cancer are crucial for determining the disease stage. Node-RADS was introduced to provide a standardized evaluation of breast cancer lymph nodes.

389,"39369684","Prediction of pathological complete response to chemotherapy for breast cancer using deep neural network with uncertainty quantification.","The I-SPY 2 trial is a national-wide, multi-institutional clinical trial designed to evaluate multiple new therapeutic drugs for high-risk breast cancer. Previous studies suggest that pathological complete response (pCR) is a viable indicator of long-term outcomes of neoadjuvant chemotherapy for high-risk breast cancer. While pCR can be assessed during surgery after the chemotherapy, early prediction of pCR before the completion of the chemotherapy may facilitate personalized treatment management to achieve an improved outcome. Notably, the acquisition of dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance (DCEMR) images at multiple time points during the I-SPY 2 trial opens up the possibility of achieving early pCR prediction. In this study, we investigated the feasibility of the early prediction of pCR to neoadjuvant chemotherapy using multi-time point DCEMR images and clinical data acquired in the I-SPY2 trial. The prediction uncertainty was also quantified to allow physicians to make patient-specific decisions on treatment plans based on the level of associated uncertainty. The dataset used in our study included 624 patients with DCEMR images acquired at 3 time points before the completion of the chemotherapy: pretreatment (T0), after 3 cycles of treatment (T1), and after 12 cycles of treatment (T2). A convolutional long short-term memory (LSTM) network-based deep learning model, which integrated multi-time point deep image representations with clinical data, including tumor subtypes, was developed to predict pCR. The performance of the model was evaluated via the method of nested 5-fold cross validation. Moreover, we also quantified prediction uncertainty for each patient through test-time augmentation. To investigate the relationship between predictive performance and uncertainty, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was assessed on subgroups of patients stratified by the uncertainty score. By integrating clinical data and DCEMR images obtained at three-time points before treatment completion, the AUROC reached 0.833 with a sensitivity of 0.723 and specificity of 0.800. This performance was significantly superior (p < 0.01) to models using only images (AUROC = 0.706) or only clinical data (AUROC = 0.746). After stratifying the patients into eight subgroups based on the uncertainty score, we found that group #1, with the lowest uncertainty, had a superior AUROC of 0.873. The AUROC decreased to 0.637 for group #8, which had the highest uncertainty. The results indicate that our convolutional LSTM network-based deep learning model can be used to predict pCR earlier before the completion of chemotherapy. By combining clinical data and multi-time point deep image representations, our model outperforms models built solely on clinical or image data. Estimating prediction uncertainty may enable physicians to prioritize or disregard predictions based on their associated uncertainties. This approach could potentially enhance the personalization of breast cancer therapy.","2024","Medical physics"

We assessed the prognostic value of 4 novel metabolic risk scores in a real-life DLBCL cohort and compared them with the revised International Prognostic Index (IPI). Methods: We included a consecutive series of untreated DLBCL, not otherwise specified cases that were diagnosed in our hospital from 2008 to 2021 with available baseline [18F]FDG PET/CT. Clinical data were collected retrospectively, including the individual components of the revised IPI. MTV and other radiomic features, including lesion dissemination and tumor volume surface ratio, were calculated. Four novel metabolic risk scores including the international metabolic prognostic index (IMPI), the MTV/World Health Organization performance status, the MTV/standardized maximum distance, and clinical PET models were used to calculate the risk of progression using predefined cutoffs. Survival outcomes considered were 3-y progression free survival (PFS), 3-y time to progression (TTP), and 3-y overall survival (OS). The Harrell C-index was used to assess the discriminative performance of the risk scores. A multivariable model was built. Results: We included 355 DLBCL, not otherwise specified cases with a median MTV of 219 cm3 (range, 0-5,656 cm3). The IMPI had the highest C-index for 3-y PFS, 3-y TTP, and 3-y OS among the 4 metabolic risk scores (0.674, 0.696, and 0.677, respectively). For the 3-y TTP, the IMPI outperformed the strongest clinical risk score, the IPI, although the difference in the Harrell C-indices was small (0.696 vs. 0.693). Regarding the 3-y PFS and 3-y OS, the IPI has the highest C-index of all risk scores (0.696 and 0.693). The IMPI, the MTV/World Health Organization performance status, and the IPI score can recognize a poor risk group with a 3-y OS below 50% (43%, 32%, and 39%, respectively). In multivariable analysis, the IMPI remains an independent prognostic factor (P = 0.0089; hazard ratio, 1.207; 95% CI, 1.048-1.389). MTV and standardized maximum distance have the strongest prognostic values when used as a continuous variable. The tumor volume surface ratio has no significant prognostic value in our analysis. Conclusion: The IMPI has the strongest prognostic performance compared with the other 3 novel metabolic risk scores. However, in our real-world dataset, the IMPI could not replace the IPI, and further prospective trials are needed to compare their performance.","2024","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine"

To investigate whether urinary EPX (a marker of eosinophil activation) in children at age 3 years may be useful for the prediction of wheeze persistence and future asthma diagnosis. U-EPX was measured at age 3 years (radioimmunoassay) in 906 participants in the population-based birth cohort. Children attended follow-ups to age 16 years. We investigate the discriminative ability of u-EPX and other factors in predicting asthma diagnosis at age 16 using receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curves. Of 613 children with follow-up information at age 16, 511 had data on u-EPX at age 3 and asthma diagnosis at age 16 years; of those; 133 (21.7%) had asthma. Based on longitudinal data, children were assigned to wheeze clusters: No wheeze (NWZ), early transient (ETW), late-onset (LOW), intermittent (INT) and persistent wheeze (PEW). U-EPX levels differed significantly between different wheeze clusters (p = .003), with clusters characterised with persistent symptoms having higher u-EPX. In the whole cohort, the best performing classification model for asthma diagnosis at age 16 years included sex, u-EPX, sensitisation and wheeze (area under the curve (AUC) = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.76-0.88). u-EPX and allergic sensitisation alone had similar predictive power (AUC [95%CI]: 0.64 [0.58-0.71] and 0.65 [0.60-0.71]). The best performing classification model for asthma prediction among children with doctor-confirmed wheeze in the first 3 years included child's u-EPX and sensitisation at age 3 years, sex, gestational age and maternal atopy (AUC: 0.76, 95%CI: 0.67-0.85).

Specifically, we aimed to determine its association with non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and the progression of liver fibrosis. The study included 393 patients diagnosed with NAFLD after liver biopsy. The patients were divided into two distinct cohorts: a training cohort (N = 320) and a validation cohort (N = 73). The training cohort was further divided into four groups based on TyG-BMI quartiles. The clinical characteristics of the patients in each group were compared in detail, and the association between TyG-BMI and NASH, NAFLD Activity Score (NAS) ≥ 4, at-risk NASH, significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis was analyzed using multiple models. Additionally, we generated receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to evaluate the predictive ability of TyG-BMI for NASH and fibrosis staging in patients with NAFLD. Patients with higher TyG-BMI values had a significantly higher prevalence of NASH, NAS ≥ 4, at-risk NASH, significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis (all p < .05). TyG-BMI was an independent predictor of these diseases in both unadjusted and adjusted models (all p < .05). ROC curve analysis further revealed the excellent performance of TyG-BMI in predicting NASH, NAS ≥ 4, at-risk NASH, significant fibrosis, advanced fibrosis, and cirrhosis. The validation cohort yielded analogous results. Furthermore, we constructed three multivariate models of TyG-BMI in conjunction with elastography metrics, which demonstrated elevated diagnostic AUC values of 0.782, 0.792, 0.794, 0.785, 0.834, and 0.845, respectively. This study confirms a significant association between insulin resistance and NAFLD, including at-risk NASH and fibrosis staging, as assessed using the TyG-BMI index.

Then, by machine learning algorithms, including extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), random survival forest (RSF), and Cox regression, we screened for feature genes associated with prognosis and constructed a 5-gene panel for risk stratification. The prediction efficacy of the 5-gene panel was compared with FIGO stage and residual disease by receiver operating characteristic curve and decision curve analysis. The feature mutated genes related to prognosis, selected by machine learning algorithms, include MUC16, ATM, NOTCH3, KMT2A, and CTNNA1. The 5-gene panel can effectively distinguish the prognosis, as well as platinum response, of advanced OCCC in both internal and external cohorts, with the predictive capability superior to FIGO stage and residual disease. Mutations in genes, including MUC16, ATM, NOTCH3, KMT2A, and CTNNA1, were associated with the poor prognosis of advanced OCCC.

Notably, not all patients with BRCA1/2 mutations achieve favorable outcomes with poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARPi), indicating the necessity for risk stratification. In this study, we aimed to develop and validate a multimodal model for predicting BRCA1/2 gene status and prognosis with PARPi treatment. We included 1695 slides from 1417 patients with ovarian, breast, prostate, and pancreatic cancers across three independent cohorts. Using a self-attention mechanism, we constructed a multi-instance attention model (MIAM) to detect BRCA1/2 gene status from hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) pathological images. We further combined tissue features from the MIAM model, cell features, and clinical factors (the MIAM-C model) to predict BRCA1/2 mutations and progression-free survival (PFS) with PARPi therapy. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) and Kaplan-Meier analysis. Morphological features contributing to MIAM-C were analyzed for interpretability. Across the four cancer types, MIAM-C outperformed the deep learning-based MIAM in identifying the BRCA1/2 genotype. Interpretability analysis revealed that high-attention regions included high-grade tumors and lymphocytic infiltration, which correlated with BRCA1/2 mutations. Notably, high lymphocyte ratios appeared characteristic of BRCA1/2 mutations. Furthermore, MIAM-C predicted PARPi therapy response (log-rank p < 0.05) and served as an independent prognostic factor for patients with BRCA1/2-mutant ovarian cancer (p < 0.05, hazard ratio:0.4, 95% confidence interval: 0.16-0.99).

The XGBoost-based predictor was validated on an independent subset of held-out data, demonstrating areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) of 0.97 and 0.94, and the average precision from the precision-recall curve of 0.99 and 0.94 for structure-based and sequence-based predictions, respectively. Finally, PredictONCO calculates the docking results of small molecules approved by regulatory authorities. We demonstrate the applicability of the tool by presenting its usage for variants in two cancer-associated proteins, cellular tumour antigen p53 and fibroblast growth factor receptor FGFR1.

Data of Finnish participants (women/men n = 192/36, mean age (SD) of 76.9 (4.8) years) recruited in the SPRINTT trial (NCT02582138) were used. Sarcopenia was determined as a combination of low muscle function (chair-stand-test) and low appendicular lean mass (ALM) detected by whole-body dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Associations of case-finding tools with sarcopenia were analysed using ROC curves and logistic regression. The rates of probable and confirmed sarcopenia were 95% and 18% in women and 94% and 36% in men, respectively. Performance of CC for sarcopenia (women AUC 0.85 [95% CI 0.78-0.92]/ men 0.85 [95% CI 0.71-1.0]) was superior to that of other tools; (AUC in women/men for SARC-F was 0.57/0.50, for SARC-CalF 0.76/0.79, and for BMI-adjusted CC 0.68/0.66). The best performance was found for a CC cut-off point of ≤ 34 cm in women with sensitivity/specificity 82.4/75.3% and ≤ 36 cm in men with sensitivity/specificity 76.9/87.0%. For each cm decrease in CC, adjusted for age and BMI, there was a 30% increase in the odds of sarcopenia in women (OR 1.30, 95% CI 1.09─1.56). Although there was a similar pattern in men, the results did not reach statistical significance (OR 1.34, 95% CI 0.84- 2.14). CC was superior to other tools for sarcopenia case-finding.

There are a limited number of studies that have investigated the functional prognosis of acute mild ischemic stroke or TIA based on imaging indicators. This study aims to explore the relationship between Perfusion Variables and poor prognosis in patients with mild ischemic stroke or TIA. A retrospective analysis was conducted on a cohort of 344 patients with mild ischemic stroke or TIA, who were admitted and treated at the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University between January 2016 and March 2022. The criteria were National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores of ≤5. Poor outcome was defined as a modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score of ≥2 points at 90 days. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to identify the risk factors associated with clinical outcomes. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to explore the cutoff value of factors. Following a 3-month follow-up period, 49 (12.4 %) out of the 344 patients with mild stroke or TIA demonstrated a poor prognosis. Multivariable regression analysis identified mismatch volume as independent predictors of a poor 90-day prognosis. The ROC curve analysis indicated that a mismatch volume exceeding 16.5 ml was associated with a higher risk of unfavorable functional outcomes. A mismatch volume of ≥16.5mL predicted poor functional outcome in mild stroke or TIA patients.","2024","Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association"

The experiment was performed on a commercial beef farm in central-west region of Brazil using 1895 Nelore heifers and cows. All females had ovulation synchronized for a TAI that was performed on D0. Twenty-one days after the TAI, all animals had their ovaries evaluated by ultrasound for pregnancy diagnosis based on the size of the corpus luteum (CL). Using B mode ultrasonography, females without a CL or with a CL ≤ 10 mm in diameter were considered nonpregnant, whereas females with a CL > 10 mm in diameter were considered potentially pregnant. After the B mode examination, the Doppler mode was turned on, and the CL was evaluated by the subjective percentage of blood perfusion in the total area of the CL. Using Doppler mode, females were considered nonpregnant if they had no CL or the CL had ≤25 % of the total area with detectable blood perfusion, whereas animals with >25 % blood perfusion in the CL were considered potentially pregnant. The results for each method (potentially pregnant or nonpregnant) were later compared with the gold standard technique, which was a pregnancy diagnosis on D33 after TAI using ultrasound with visualization of an embryonic heartbeat. The accuracy was determined using the 2 × 2 contingency table approach. The area under the curve using the receiver operating characteristic curve for Doppler mode and B mode were 0.929 and 0.902 (P < 0.01), respectively. There were almost no false negatives (designated non-pregnant but later pregnant at D33) with either technique (0.2 % vs. 0.3 %; P = 0.65 for Doppler mode vs. B mode, respectively). False positives (designated pregnant but non-pregnant on D33) were greater for B mode compared to Doppler (19.1 % vs. 14.0 %; P < 0.01). This resulted in Doppler mode having similar high values as B mode for Negative Predictive Value (99.9 vs. 99.6 %; P = 0.85) and Sensitivity (99.8 vs. 99.7 %; P = 0.86) but there were differences in Specificity (86 vs. 80.9 %; P < 0.01), Positive Predictive Value (88 vs. 84.3 %; P < 0.01), and Accuracy (93.0 vs. 90.4 %; P < 0.01). In conclusion, evaluation of CL blood perfusion by Doppler produced greater accuracy in the early identification of nonpregnant heifers and cows on D21 after TAI than measurement of CL diameter with B mode ultrasound; although both had over 90 % accuracy in identifying pregnant and nonpregnant females.","2024","Theriogenology"

It was aimed to compare pulmonary nodule risk calculation models and evaluate their effectiveness and applicability for the Turkish population. Between 2014 and 2019, 351 patients who were operated on for pulmonary nodules were evaluated with the following data: age, gender, smoking history, family history of lung cancer, extrapulmonary malignancy and granulomatous disease, nodule diameter, attenuation character, side, localization, spiculation, nodule count, presence of pulmonary emphysema, FDG uptake in PET/CT of the nodule, and definitive pathology data. Malignancy risk scores were calculated using the equations of the Brock, Mayo, and Herder models. The results were evaluated statistically. The mean age of the 351 patients (236 men, 115 women) was 57.84 ± 10.87 (range 14-79) years, and 226 malignant and 125 benign nodules were observed. Significant correlations were found between malignancy and age (p < 0.001), nodule diameter (p < 0.001), gender (p < 0.009), speculation (p < 0.001), emphysema (p < 0.05), FDG uptake (p < 0.001). All three models were found effective in the differentiation (p < 0.001). The ideal threshold value was determined for the Brock (19.5%), Mayo (23.1%), and Herder (56%) models. All models were effective for nodules of > 10 mm, but none of them were for 0-10 mm. Brock was effective in ground-glass nodules (p = 0.02) and all models were effective for semi-solid and solid nodules. None of the groups could provide AUC values as high as those achieved in the original studies. This suggests the need to optimize models and malignancy risk thresholds for Turkish population.","2024","Updates in surgery"

Preoperative imaging features were extracted (seven from US and nine from CECT imaging) to explore their relationship with VETC. A VETC prediction model was constructed and graphically depicted as a nomogram. Its performance was evaluated via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The VETC incidence for all the lesions was 37.7%. The final variables included in the nomogram were ""peritumoral enhancement in CECT"", ""alpha-fetoprotein level > 200 ng/Ml,"" ""halo in US,"" ""capsule enhancement in CECT,"" and ""posterior acoustic enhancement in US."" The area under the curve (AUC) values for the training and validation cohorts were 0.824 and 0.725, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow fit test showed no statistical difference (p = 0.369 and p = 0.067 for the training and validation cohorts, respectively). DCA demonstrated that our nomogram provided clinical benefits to a wide range of patients. According to the nomogram score, the VETC-positive and -negative groups demonstrated significant differences in both the training (p < 0.001) and validation (p = 0.001) cohorts.

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), odds ratio, relative risk and Youden's index were employed to assess discrimination. Respiratory rate ≥22/min demonstrated the most superior diagnostic value, indicated by largest odds ratio, relative risk and AUROC, and maximum Youden's index for mortality. However, the indices for altered mentation and systolic blood pressure (SBP) ≤100 mm Hg decreased notably in turn. The predictive validities of respiratory rate ≥22/min, altered mentation and SBP ≤100 mm Hg were good, adequate and poor for mortality, indicated by AUROC (0.837, 0.734 and 0.671, respectively). Respiratory rate ≥22/min showed the strongest associations with SOFA scores, pneumonia severity index, hospital length of stay and costs. However, SBP ≤100 mm Hg was most weakly correlated with the indices. Respiratory rate ≥22/min made the greatest contribution to parsimonious qSOFA to assess severity and predict mortality. However, the contributions of altered mentation and SBP ≤100 mm Hg decreased strikingly in turn.

Our model achieved an accuracy of 93% and an area under the ROC curve of 0.93 for predicting one-year mortality. Notably, 'EMERGENCY ADMISSION DATE TIME' emerged as the most influential predictor, followed by age and pre-operative days. The model demonstrated robust performance across different patient subgroups and outperformed traditional statistical methods. The personalized risk prediction tool provides clinicians with real-time, patient-specific risk assessments and insights into contributing factors. Our study presents a highly accurate model for predicting one-year mortality following orthopedic hospitalization. The significance of 'EMERGENCY ADMISSION DATE TIME' as the primary predictor highlights the importance of admission timing in patient outcomes.

Recently, a DNA methylation-based TL estimator, known as DNAmTL, has emerged as a novel TL measurement tool. Our current investigation scrutinized the correlation between DNAmTL and the risks of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and enduring mortality among middle-aged and elderly individuals. We enrolled a nationwide, population-based cohort of subjects from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey spanning 1999 to 2002, possessing data on both DNAmTL and quantitative polymerase chain reaction-based TL (qPCRTL). Logistic regression models and Cox proportional hazards models were employed to evaluate the associations of DNAmTL with CVD risk and mortality, respectively. The cohort comprised 2532 participants, with a weighted CVD prevalence of 19.06%. Notably, each one-kilobase increase in DNAmTL was linked to a 53% diminished CVD risk [odds ratio (OR): 0.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.23-0.95, P = 0.035]. Over a median follow-up period of 206 months, 1361 deaths were recorded (53.75%), with 590 (23.30%) ascribable to CVD. Individuals with the lengthiest DNAmTL exhibited a 36% lower risk of all-cause mortality (hazard ratio (HR): 0.64, 95% CI: 0.49-0.85, P = 0.002) and a 35% decrease in CVD mortality (HR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.43-0.98, P = 0.044) compared to those with shortest DNAmTL.

Univariate Cox regression analysis was performed to collect differentially expressed mRNA (DEmRNAs) from HCC and non-tumor tissues, and YEATS2, a prognostic marker, was identified by further analysis. ROC curve, survival analysis and multivariate Cox regression analysis as well as nomograms were used to evaluate the prognosis of this gene. Finally, the biological function of this gene was preliminarily discussed by using single gene Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA), and the YEATS2 overexpression and knockdown hepatoma cell line was used to verify the results in vitro and in vivo. Based on the clinical information of HCC in TCGA, GEO and ICGC databases, the gene YEATS2 with significant differences from HCC was identified. There was a statistical difference in the survival prognosis between the two databases and the ROC curve showed that the survival of HCC in both TCGA, GSE14520 and ICGC groups had a satisfactory predictive effect. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that YEATS2 was an independent prognostic factor for HCC, and Nomograms, which combined this prognostic feature with significant clinical features, provided an important reference for the clinical prognostic diagnosis of HCC. Next, we constructed overexpression and knockdown YEATS2 cell line in Hep3B and LM3 cells, and further proved that overexpression YEATS2 promote the proliferation and migration of HCC cells by CCK8, colony formation experiment, and transwell assays, and knockdown YEATS2 inhibited the proliferation and migration of HCC cells by CCK8, colony formation experiment, and transwell assays. Finally, the biological function of YEATS2 was preliminarily explored through GSEA analysis of a single gene, and it was found that it was significantly correlated with cell cycle and DNA repair, which provided us with ideas for further analysis. Furthermore, the knockdown of YEATS2 promoted radiation-induced DNA damage, enhanced radiosensitivity, and ultimately inhibited the proliferation of hepatocellular carcinoma cells in vitro and in vivo. Our study identified a promising prognostic marker for hepatocellular carcinoma that is useful for clinical decision-making and individualized treatment.","2024","Cellular oncology (Dordrecht, Netherlands)"

The primary endpoint, though, was 21-day TFS. Clinical data was collected from all patients, and independent risk factors associated with death/liver transplantation was identified using both uni- and multi-variate Cox regression analyses. Independent risk factors incorporated into the predictive nomogram are neutrophils (HR = 1.148, 95% CI = 1.048-1.257), prothrombin time (HR = 1.048, 95% CI = 1.017-1.080), albumin (HR = 0.880, 95% CI = 0.823-0.941), acute kidney injury (HR = 2.487, 95% CI = 1.134-5.452), and hepatic encephalopathy (HR = 3.378, 95% CI = 1.744-6.543). The resulting nomogram was highly predictive, with an area under the curve of 0.947 for 21-day TFS. Compared to existing models, such as the Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score, the predictive nomogram is more accurate, only requires easily-measurable clinical and laboratory metrics, as well as being able to directly calculate TFS at various time points.","2024","Annals of medicine"

The post-acute phase of COVID-19 refers to the persistent or new symptoms. This problem is becoming more relevant with the increasing number of patients who have contracted COVID-19 and the emergence of new virus variants. In this case, preventive treatment with corticosteroids can be applied. However, not everyone benefits from the treatment, moreover, it can have severe side effects. Currently, no study would analyze who benefits from the treatment. This work introduces a novel approach to the recommendation of Corticosteroid (CS) treatment for patients in the post-acute phase. We have used a novel combination of clinical data, including blood tests, spirometry, and X-ray images from 273 patients. These are very challenging to collect, especially from patients in the post-acute phase of COVID-19. To our knowledge, no similar dataset exists in the literature. Moreover, we have proposed a unique methodology that combines machine learning and deep learning models based on Vision Transformer (ViT) and InceptionNet, preprocessing techniques, and pretraining strategies to deal with the specific characteristics of our data. The experiments have proved that combining clinical data with CXR images achieves 8% higher accuracy than independent analysis of CXR images. The proposed method reached 80.0% accuracy (78.7% balanced accuracy) and a ROC-AUC of 0.89. The introduced system for CS treatment prediction using our neural network and learning algorithm is unique in this field of research. Here, we have shown the efficiency of using mixed data and proved it on real-world data. The paper also introduces the factors that could be used to predict long-term complications.

Among them, 241 cases of COVID-19 were screened(171 DAT-positive and 70 DAT-negative), clinical and laboratory indicators were compared between DAT-positive and DAT-negative groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, the Kaplan-Meier survival curve and receiver operating curves were used to explore the relation between the DAT type and in-hospital mortality of patients with COVID-19. The proportion of confirmed COVID-19 cases was higher in the DAT-positive group than in the DAT-negative group (67.9 % vs. 28.0 %, P < 0.05). Patients with COVID-19 in the DAT-positive group had higher age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index scores, red blood cell distribution width (RDW), lactate dehydrogenase, prothrombin time, D-dimer, creatinine, and high-sensitive cardiac troponin T levels than the negative group (P < 0.05), In contrast, hemoglobin and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) levels were lower in the DAT-positive group. The DAT-positive group also had a higher red blood cell usage volume and in-hospital mortality rate than the DAT-negative group. The mortality rate of patients with COVID-19 with both IgG and C3d positive was higher than that of the other groups.

We conducted subgroup analyses for patients in clinical remission. We analysed 213 IUS examinations performed on 97 patients; 170 (80%) IUS were during clinical remission. The area under the curve for LRG for each IUS score (0.76, 0.80, 0.77, 0.75 and 0.69, respectively) was superior to that of CRP and was statistically significant, particularly for LS, BUSS, IBUS-SAS and Simple-US (p < 0.001, p = 0.018, p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Predictive values remained consistent among patients in remission. LRG demonstrated excellent correlation with IUS scores in both the overall patient population and those in remission.

General information, employment status, pension, health insurance, and presence of depressive symptoms were compared between the two groups. LASSO regression analysis was employed to identify the most predictive variables for the model, utilizing 14-fold cross-validation. The risk prediction model for cognitive impairment in hypertensive populations was developed using generalized linear models. The model's discriminatory power was evaluated through the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and calibration curves. Results: In the modeling group, eight variables such as gender, age, residence, education, alcohol use, depression, employment status, and health insurance were ultimately selected from an initial pool of 21 potential predictors to construct the risk prediction model. The area under the curve (AUC) values for the training, internal, and external validation sets were 0.777, 0.785, and 0.782, respectively. All exceeded the threshold of 0.7, suggesting that the model effectively predicts the incidence of mild cognitive dysfunction in community-based hypertensive patients. A risk prediction model was developed using a generalized linear model in conjunction with Lasso regression. The model's performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Hosmer-Lemeshow test values yielded p = .346 and p = .626, both of which exceeded the 0.05 threshold. Calibration curves demonstrated a significant agreement between the nomogram model and observed outcomes, serving as an effective tool for evaluating the model's predictive performance. Discussion: The predictive model developed in this study serves as a promising and efficient tool for evaluating cognitive impairment in hypertensive patients, aiding community healthcare workers in identifying at-risk populations.","2024","Journal of applied gerontology : the official journal of the Southern Gerontological Society"

However, no studies had explored the associations between features from delayed phase as well as multiphases DCE-MRI and the LVI status. Thus, we aimed to develop an efficient nomogram based on multiphases DCE-MRI to predict the LVI status in invasive (IBC) breast cancer patients. A retrospective analysis was conducted on preoperative clinical, pathological, and DCE-MRI data of 173 breast cancer patients. All patients were randomly assigned into training set (n=121) and validation set (n=52) in 7:3 ratio. The clinical, pathologic, and conventional MRI characteristics were then subjected to univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis, and the clinical risk factors with P < 0.05 in the multivariate logistic regression were used to build clinical models. Different single-phase models (early phase, peak phase, and terminal phase), as well as a multiphases model integrating radiomics features from multiple phases, were established. Furthermore, a preoperative radiomics nomogram model was constructed by combining the rad-score of the multiphases model with clinicopathologic independent risk factors. Finally, the performance of the multiphases model, clinical model, and rad-score was compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC) values, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The clinical utility of the rad-score was evaluated using calibration curves, and Delong test was used to compare the differences in AUC values among the different models. The axillary lymph nodes (ALN) status and Ki-67 had been identified as clinicopathologic independent predictors and a clinical model had been constructed. Image features that were extracted from the terminal phase of the DCE-MRI exhibited notably superior predictive performances compared to features from the other single phases. Particularly, in the multiphases model, terminal phase features were identified as potentially providing more predictive information. Among the nine features that were found to be associated with LVI in the multiphase model, one was derived from the early phase, two from the peak phase, and six from the terminal phase, indicating that terminal phase features contributed significantly more information towards predicting LVI. Evaluation of the nomogram performance revealed promising results in both the training set (AUCs: clinical model vs. multiphase model vs. nomogram=0.734 vs. 0.840 vs. 0.876) and the validation set (AUCs: clinical model vs. multiphase model vs. nomogram=0.765 vs. 0.753 vs. 0.832). The DCE-MRI-based radiomics model demonstrated utility in predicting LVI status, features of the terminal phase offered more valuable information particularly. The preoperative radiomics nomogram enhanced the diagnostic capability of identifying LVI status in IBC patients, and might aid clinicians in making personalized treatment decisions.","2024","Academic radiology"

Methods: Patients with COVID-19 pneumonia who underwent chest CT were included and divided into survivors/non-survivors and intubated/not-intubated. Chest CTs were analyzed through a (1) Total Severity Score visually quantified by an emergency (TSS1) and a thoracic radiologist (TSS2); (2) density mask technique quantifying normal parenchyma (DM_Norm 1) and ground glass opacities (DM_GGO1) repeated after the manual delineation of consolidations (DM_Norm2, DM_GGO2, DM_Consolidation); (3) texture analysis quantifying normal parenchyma (TA_Norm) and interstitial lung disease (TA_ILD). Association with outcomes was assessed through Chi-square and the Mann-Whitney test. The TSS inter-reader variability was assessed through intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis. The relationship between quantitative variables and outcomes was investigated through multivariate logistic regression analysis. Variables correlation was investigated using Spearman analysis. Results: Overall, 192 patients (mean age, 66.8 ± 15.4 years) were included. TSS was significantly higher in intubated patients but only TSS1 in survivors. TSS presented an ICC of 0.83 (0.76; 0.88) and a bias (LOA) of 1.55 (-4.69, 7.78). DM_Consolidation showed the greatest median difference between survivors/not survivors (p = 0.002). The strongest independent predictor for mortality was DM_Consolidation (AUC 0.688), while the strongest independent predictor for the intensity of care was TSS2 (0.7498). DM_Norm 2 was the singular feature independently associated with both the outcomes. DM_GGO1 strongly correlated with TA_ILD (ρ = 0.977). Conclusions: The DM technique and TA achieved consistent measurements and a better correlation with patient outcomes.","2024","Journal of clinical medicine"

Zhengqing Fengtongning (ZF) is a traditional Chinese medicine preparation used to treat RA. ZF may cause liver injury. In this study, we aimed to develop a prediction model for abnormal liver function caused by ZF. This retrospective study collected data from multiple centers from January 2018 to April 2023. Abnormal liver function was set as the target variable according to the alanine transaminase (ALT) level. Features were screened through univariate analysis and sequential forward selection for modeling. Ten machine learning and deep learning models were compared to find the model that most effectively predicted liver function from the available data. This study included 1,913 eligible patients. The LightGBM model exhibited the best performance (accuracy = 0.96) out of the 10 learning models. The predictive metrics of the LightGBM model were as follows: precision = 0.99, recall rate = 0.97, F1_score = 0.98, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98, sensitivity = 0.97 and specificity = 0.85 for predicting ALT < 40 U/L; precision = 0.60, recall rate = 0.83, F1_score = 0.70, AUC = 0.98, sensitivity = 0.83 and specificity = 0.97 for predicting 40 ≤ ALT < 80 U/L; and precision = 0.83, recall rate = 0.63, F1_score = 0.71, AUC = 0.97, sensitivity = 0.63 and specificity = 1.00 for predicting ALT ≥ 80 U/L.

The study retrospectively included patients with AKI who underwent CRRT during their initial hospitalization in the United States using the medical information mart for intensive care (MIMIC) database IV (version 2.0), as well as in the intensive care unit (ICU) of Huzhou Central Hospital. Patients from the MIMIC database were used as the training cohort to construct the models (from 2008 to 2019, n = 1068). Patients from Huzhou Central Hospital were utilized as the external validation cohort to evaluate the models (from June 2019 to December 2022, n = 327). In the training cohort, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression with cross-validation was employed to select features for constructing the model and subsequently established nine ML predictive models. The performance of these nine models on the external validation cohort dataset was comprehensively evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the optimal model was selected. A static nomogram and a web-based dynamic nomogram were presented, with a comprehensive evaluation from the perspectives of discrimination (AUROC), calibration (calibration curve) and clinical practicability (DCA curves). Finally, 1395 eligible patients were enrolled, including 1068 patients in the training cohort and 327 patients in the external validation cohort. In the training cohort, LASSO regression with cross-validation was employed to select features and nine models were individually constructed. Compared to the other eight models, the Lasso regularized logistic regression (Lasso-LR) model exhibited the highest AUROC (0.756) and the optimal calibration curve. The DCA curve suggested a certain clinical utility in predicting in-hospital mortality among critically ill patients with AKI undergoing CRRT. Consequently, the Lasso-LR model was the optimal model and it was visualized as a common nomogram (static nomogram) and a web-based dynamic nomogram (https://chsyh2006.shinyapps.io/dynnomapp/). Discrimination, calibration and DCA curves were employed to assess the performance of the nomogram. The AUROC for the training and external validation cohorts in the nomogram model was 0.771 (95%CI: 0.743, 0.799) and 0.756 (95%CI: 0.702, 0.809), respectively. The calibration slope and Brier score for the training cohort were 1.000 and 0.195, while for the external validation cohort, they were 0.849 and 0.197, respectively. The DCA indicated that the model had a certain clinical application value. Our study selected the optimal model and visualized it as a static and dynamic nomogram integrating clinical predictors, so that clinicians can personalized predict the in-hospital outcome of critically ill patients with AKI undergoing CRRT upon ICU admission.","2024","Annals of medicine"

This study aimed to construct radiomics models based on before and after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) MRI for predicting the histological response to NAC in patients with high-grade osteosarcoma. We included 109 patients with localized high-grade osteosarcomas of the extremities, who underwent pre- and post-NAC MRI examinations, from which radiomics features were extracted. According to the tumor necrosis rate, all patients were classified as good responders (GRs) or poor responders (PRs) and were randomly allocated into training and test sets at a 7:3 ratio. Radiomics features were extracted from T2-weighted (T2WI) and contrast-enhanced T1-weighted imaging (T1CE) of the two MRI scans to construct three models: pre-NAC, post-NAC, and combined pre-NAC and post-NAC (combined model). In total, 1175 radiomics features were extracted from each sequence. Following feature selection, nine radiomics features were selected for each model to construct radiomics signatures. The radiomics signatures of the pre-NAC, post-NAC, and combined models demonstrated good predictive performance for chemotherapy response in osteosarcoma. The combined model achieved the highest areas under the receiver operating curve (AUC) values of 0.999 and 0.915 in the training and test sets, respectively. The AUCs of the post-NAC model were higher than those of the pre-NAC model.

Probabilistic ensemble machine learning was employed to predict sleep apnea status at three AHI cutoff points: ≥ 5, ≥ 15, and ≥ 30 events/hour. To investigate the impact of data granularity, SpO2 data were aggregated at 30, 60, and 300 s. Our models demonstrated good to excellent performance on internal test, with average area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.91, 0.93, and 0.96 for cutoffs ≥ 5, ≥ 15, and ≥ 30 at data granularity of 1 s, respectively. Both sensitivity (0.76, 0.84, 0.89) and specificity (0.87, 0.86, 0.90) ranged from good to excellent across three cutoffs. Positive predictive values (PPV) ranged from excellent to fair (0.97, 0.83, 0.66), and negative predictive values (NPV) ranged from low to excellent (0.43, 0.87, 0.98). Model performance on external test slightly dropped compared to internal test, but still achieved good to excellent AUC above 0.80 across all data granularity and all the three cutoffs. Data granularity of 300 s led to a reduction in performance metrics across all cutoffs. Our models demonstrated superior performance across all three AHI cutoff thresholds compared to existing large sleep apnea screening models, even when considering varying SpO2 data granularity. However, lower data granularity was associated with decreased screening performance, indicating a need for further research in this area.","2024","Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung"

The study gathered data from 15 medical institutions in Ningxia between January and December 2022 using cloud platforms. The dataset included basic information and 72-h ECG monitoring for 2573 hypertensive patients over 65. OSA screening was conducted using the single-lead wearable ECG devices based on the ACAT algorithm. A multivariable logistic regression identified the main factors affecting OSA severity in these patients, and the AUC was used to assess the model's predictive accuracy. The study found an OSA detection rate of 87.10%, with 55.42% being moderate to severe cases. Key risk factors associated with developing moderate-to-severe OSA included cardiac irregularities like supraventricular extrasystole and atrioventricular block, male gender, lifestyle factors like alcohol consumption and smoking, and health indicators such as SDNN ≤ 100 ms, abnormal LF/HF ratio, BMI, and age. The model's accuracy for predicting OSA, indicated by a ROAUC of 0.625, was moderate. Factors like gender, tea consumption, stroke history, and ventricular tachycardia were also independently linked to OSA severity. This study combines single-lead wearable ECG devices with the ACAT algorithm for OSA screening in Ningxia, China. Initial screening identified 87.10% of participants as having OSA, with 55.42% being moderate to severe cases. This suggests a convenient, low-cost, and repeatable ECG-based method for OSA screening, potentially improving early detection and management of OSA by identifying potential risk factors.","2024","Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung"

Measurements from some time periods may not be available for all patients. Using the framework of algorithm-agnostic variable importance, we study the predictive potential of variables corresponding to different time horizons prior to the index visit and demonstrate the application of variable importance techniques in the biomedical informatics setting. We use variable importance to quantify the potential of recent (up to three months before the index visit) and distant (more than one year before the index visit) patient mental health information for predicting self-harm risk using data from seven health systems. We quantify importance as the decrease in predictiveness when the variable set of interest is excluded from the prediction task. We define predictiveness using discriminative metrics: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and positive predictive value. Mental health predictors corresponding to the three months prior to the index visit show strong signal of importance; in one setting, excluding these variables decreased AUC from 0.85 to 0.77. Predictors corresponding to more distant information were less important. Predictors from the months immediately preceding the index visit are highly important. Implementation of self-harm prediction models may be challenging in settings where recent data are not completely available (e.g., due to lags in insurance claims processing) at the time a prediction is made. Clinically derived variables from different time frames exhibit varying levels of importance for predicting self-harm. Variable importance analyses can inform whether and how to implement risk prediction models into clinical practice given real-world data limitations. These analyses be applied more broadly in biomedical informatics research to provide insight into general clinical risk prediction tasks.","2024","Journal of biomedical informatics"

A polygenic risk score (PRS) was constructed based on the type 2 diabetes loci from the BioBank Japan study. A multiple logistic regression model was used to estimate the association between genetic risk, healthy lifestyle, and diabetes incidence and to calculate the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Of the 11,014 adults included (67.8% women; mean age [standard deviation], 59.1 [11.3] years old), 297 (2.7%) developed diabetes during a mean 4.3 (0.8) years of follow-up. Genetic and lifestyle score is independently associated with the development of diabetes. Compared with the low genetic risk and ideal lifestyle groups, the odds ratio was 3.31 for the low genetic risk and poor lifestyle group.

Finally, 10 differentially expressed CEGs were screened out. The random forest algorithm was constructed to identify 6 signature CRGs (THBS1, SERPINA1, THBD, MMP9, MAFF, and PLAU). Subsequently, the established predictive model was found to have good diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.9694 in the training cohort [GSE66360 dataset] and 0.9076 in the external validation cohort [GSE48060 dataset]). Consensus clustering identified the CRG clusters, and the accuracy of the grouping was verified. We found that AMI patients can be divided into two distinct subgroups based on the differentially expressed CRGs. Immune cell infiltration level was consistent with the expression levels of CRGs based on single sample gene set enrichment analysis. These findings reveal the potential role of CRGs in AMI. Characterizing the coagulation features of AMI patients can help in the risk stratification of patients and provide personalized treatment strategies.","2024","Genes and immunity"

However, it suffers from inter- and intra-operator variability. A quantitative assessment of the impact of variations in these delineations on the performance of the radiomics predictors is required to develop robust radiomics based prediction models. In this study, we developed radiomics models for the prediction of pathological complete response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with two different breast cancer subtypes based on contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging acquired prior to treatment (baseline MRI scans). Different mathematical operations such as erosion, smoothing, dilation, randomization, and ellipse fitting were applied to the original VOIs delineated by experts to simulate variations of segmentation masks. The effects of such VOI modifications on various steps of the radiomics workflow, including feature extraction, feature selection, and prediction performance, were evaluated. Using manual tumor VOIs and radiomics features extracted from baseline MRI scans, an AUC of up to 0.96 and 0.89 was achieved for human epidermal growth receptor 2 positive and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively. For smoothing and erosion, VOIs yielded the highest number of robust features and the best prediction performance, while ellipse fitting and dilation lead to the lowest robustness and prediction performance for both breast cancer subtypes. At most 28% of the selected features were similar to manual VOIs when different VOI delineation data were used. Differences in VOI delineation affect different steps of radiomics analysis, and their quantification is therefore important for development of standardized radiomics research.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

Despite evidence suggesting that several inflammation biomarkers are closely related to HT, its utility in sHT risk stratification remains unclear. This study aimed to identify and integrate effective inflammatory biomarkers associated with sHT and to develop a novel nomogram model for the early detection of sHT. We conducted a retrospective observational cohort study of AIS patients receiving conventional medical treatment solely from March 2022 to March 2023, using a prospectively maintained database. All patients underwent CT follow-up within 7 days after admission, with sHT occurrence within this period as the outcome. Data on demographics, clinical information, laboratory results, and imaging were collected. The cohort was divided into training and validation sets (7:3). Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression selected inflammatory biomarkers for a novel index. Univariable and multivariable logistic regressions were conducted to identify independent sHT risk factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis determined optimal cut-off values for continuous factors. A nomogram was developed and validated internally and externally. Predictive accuracy was assessed using the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and calibration plots. Decision curve analysis (DCA) evaluated clinical usefulness. Of 803 AIS patients, 325 were included in the final analysis. sHT was found in 9.5% (31 patients). Training (n = 228) and validation (n = 97) cohorts showed no significant demographic or clinical differences. LASSO regression integrated neutrophil-to-albumin ratio (NAR) and triglycerides (TGs) into a novel index-NATG. Independent sHT risk factors included baseline National Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) (OR = 1.09, 95% CI (1.02, 1.16), p = 0.0095), NATG (OR = 1534.87, 95% CI (5.02, 469638.44), p = 0.0120), D-dimer (DD) (OR = 1.12, 95% CI (1.01, 1.25), p = 0.0249), and total cholesterol (TC) (OR = 1.01, 95% CI (1.00, 1.01), p = 0.0280), with their respective optimal cut-off values being 13, 0.059, 0.86, and 3.6. These factors were used to develop the nomogram in the training cohort, which achieved an AUC of 0.804 (95% CI, 0.643-0.918) in the training cohort and 0.713 (95% CI, 0.499-0.868) in the validation cohort, demonstrating consistent calibration. DCA confirmed the nomogram's clinical applicability in both cohorts. A novel indicator combining NAR and TG is positively associated with sHT in AIS patients. The constructed nomogram, integrating this novel indicator with other risk factors, provides a valuable tool for identifying sHT risk, aiding in clinical decision-making.","2024","CNS neuroscience & therapeutics"

Advanced imaging techniques like cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR) and 18F-Fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography/Computed Tomography (FDG-PET/CT) are effective in detecting CS but not easily accessible. The optimal method for selecting patients for advanced screening remains uncertain. In this retrospective cohort study, all extracardiac sarcoidosis patients screened for CS were reviewed. CS was defined as a multidisciplinary team (MDT) consensus diagnosis. Univariate and multivariate binary logistic regressions were used to identify factors associated with CS, assessing their diagnostic performance, and integrating them into a diagnostic model. Out of 354 patients (average age 51.5 years, 52.5% male), 18.4% were diagnosed with CS. In our cohort, male gender, a QRS duration > 120 ms, and nsVT on Holter monitoring were identified as significant markers associated with CS. Combining age, gender, AV-block or QRS > 120ms on ECG, and nsVT on Holter monitoring provided the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC of 0.82). Cardiac biomarkers NT-proBNP and troponin T did not improve the diagnostic performance. In our cohort, male gender, a QRS duration > 120 ms, and nsVT on Holter monitoring were identified as significant markers associated with the presence of cardiac sarcoidosis. These clinical markers may aid in selecting sarcoidosis patients for screening with advanced cardiac imaging, potentially leading to earlier detection and management of the disease.","2024","Lung"

A cohort study was conducted in patients at a general hospital in Lima, Perú. An OGTT was performed in subjects with IFG who were followed-up for 7 years for T2DM development. The exposure variables were 1h-PG ≥ 155 mg/dL, MetS, and a FINDRISC ≥ 13 points, and the outcome was the presence of T2DM. The relative risk, confidence interval, and area under the curve (AUROC) were also estimated. Among 324 subjects with IFG, 218 completed the 7-year follow-up. The mean age was 56.2 ± 11.5 years, 64.0% were woman, and 63.8% were overweight/obese. Of these, 36.8% had 1h-PG ≥ 155 mg/dL and normal glucose tolerance, 66.8% had MetS, and 64.5% had FINDRISC ≥ 13 points. After 7 years, 21.1% of participants developed T2DM, with 68.8% of them who had 1h-PG ≥ 155 mg/dL (P < .001), 62.2% had MetS (P = .013), and 67.9% had FINDRISC ≥ 13 (P = .68). After adjusting by age, sex, and body mass index, the relative risk was 3.52 (1.64-7.54; 95% CI), 1.81 (0.96-3.38; 95% CI), and 1.17 (0.51-2.70; 95% CI) for each exposure variable, respectively.

Currently, molecular docking tools in B-cell epitope prediction are heavily influenced by empirical parameters and require significant computational resources, rendering a great challenge to meet large-scale prediction demands. When predicting epitopes from antigen-antibody complex, current artificial intelligence algorithms cannot accurately implement the prediction due to insufficient protein feature representations, indicating novel algorithm is desperately needed for efficient protein information extraction. In this paper, we introduce a multimodal model called WUREN (Whole-modal Union Representation for Epitope predictioN), which effectively combines sequence, graph, and structural features. It achieved AUC-PR scores of 0.213 and 0.193 on the solved structures and AlphaFold-generated structures, respectively, for the independent test proteins selected from DiscoTope3 benchmark. Our findings indicate that WUREN is an efficient feature extraction model for protein complexes, with the generalizable application potential in the development of protein-based drugs. Moreover, the streamlined framework of WUREN could be readily extended to model similar biomolecules, such as nucleic acids, carbohydrates, and lipids.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

Additionally, miRNAs play a crucial role in the development of the disease as an important component of the microenvironment. In this study, tissue specimens of eutopic and ectopic lesions of 20 women, whose endometriosis was later approved by the pathology laboratory, were biopsied through laparoscopy. As a control group, endometrial tissue specimens were collected from 20 women who underwent curettage for reasons unrelated to endometriosis. The expression levels of miR-20A and miR-145 and their target genes, TGF-β and NANOG, were measured in these samples as markers of stemness and immunomodulatory properties, respectively. The study also aimed to compare the expression levels of target genes and miRNAs in ectopic lesions regarding endometriosis recurrence post-surgery. The study revealed that the expression of TGF-β and NANOG genes was significantly upregulated in endometriotic tissues compared to the control group. There was also a notable increase in miR-20A and miR-145 expression in the endometriotic tissues compared to the control group. While there was no significant correlation between the expression of miR-20a and TGF-β, we observed a negative correlation between the expression level of miR-145 and NANOG. Additionally, the ROC curve analysis emphasized miR-14 as a potential biomarker for endometriosis over miR-20a.

Image-guided spine biopsies for culture are specific but diagnose NVO in only 50% of cases. Pre-exposure to antimicrobials further reduces diagnostic yield. Our study assesses the value of neutrophil percentage in disc space fluid and vertebral body (DS/VB) samples for diagnosing NVO. Adults referred for spine biopsy at Mayo Clinic from August 2022 to September 2023 were consented and enrolled at the time of biopsy. Following routine specimen collection, the biopsy needle was rinsed in saline into an EDTA tube for cell analysis. NVO diagnosis required organism identification in spine tissue or blood and/or positive histopathology, and consistent symptoms and imaging. Sixty-eight patients were prospectively enrolled, comprising 14 with NVO and 54 with alternative diagnoses. The median biopsy sample polymorphonuclear (PMN) percentage for NVO patients was 80.5% (IQR 72.5-85.2), compared to 64.5% (IQR 54.0-69.0) for those without NVO (p < 0.001). Nine (64.3%) NVO patients received antibiotics within 10 days prior to spine biopsy. As a continuous measure, PMN differential showed a moderately strong ability in classifying NVO status with an area under ROC curve of 0.795; an optimal point on the curve of 71.5% corresponded to a sensitivity of 78.6%, specificity of 79.6%, negative predictive value of 93.5% and positive predictive value of 50.0%. PMN differential in DS/VB biopsies may serve as an effective diagnostic tool in the evaluation of patients with NVO particularly in ambiguous cases with an initially negative spine biopsy.

Our study aimed to investigate risk factors affecting NMOSD relapse and to establish a relapse prediction model within 1 year after the first onset, providing a reference for individualized diagnosis and treatment of NMOSD patients. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 102 NMOSD patients admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and the Second People's Hospital of Wuxi from January 2020 to August 2023 at their initial presentation. Patients were divided into relapse and non-relapse groups based on the occurrence of relapse within 1 year post-diagnosis. Clinical data were compared between groups, and the relationship between each factor and disease relapse was assessed using single-factor analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors for relapse within 1 year after the first onset of NMOSD, and a Nomogram relapse prediction model was developed and validated. Significant differences were observed in NLR, B lymphocyte level, NK cell count, immunosuppressant use, EDSS score, and spinal lesion segment length between the relapsed and non-relapsed groups (P < 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that NLR, B lymphocyte level, NK cell count, non-use of immunosuppressants, and EDSS score were independent risk factors for relapse within 1 year after the first onset of NMOSD. NLR, B lymphocyte level, and EDSS score were positively correlated with the risk of disease relapse, while NK cell count was negatively correlated. A Nomogram prediction model was constructed based on these independent risk factors. The model's C index was 0.788 (95 % CI: 0.698-0.878, P = 0.000), indicating good discrimination. The Bootstrap-corrected C index was 0.787, suggesting robust calibration. Decision curve analysis confirmed the model's clinical utility. Peripheral blood NLR, B lymphocyte level, NK cell count, non-use of immunosuppressants, and EDSS score are risk factors for NMOSD relapse within 1 year after the first onset and can serve as predictive indicators.

Subsequently, we validated the expression of these DEGs using the GSE65540 dataset. Quantitative PCR and immunoblotting confirmed significantly elevated HHIP expression in the adipose tissue of HFD-fed and ob/ob mice. Furthermore, a population-based cohort study demonstrated that serum HHIP levels were significantly greater in MetS patients than in healthy controls and were correlated with all MetS components. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis confirmed the robust predictive capacity of HHIP levels for metabolic syndrome, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.72 (95 % confidence interval: 0.68-0.78, P < 0.001).

We performed a secondary analysis of a cohort of children (1 month to 18 years) who presented to a pediatric emergency department (ED) with suspected infection over a 10-year period. Septic shock was defined as intravenous vasoactive infusion within 24-hours of arrival for children with suspected infection and intravenous antibiotics administered. We developed the 4-point quick Pediatric Septic Shock Screening Score (qPS4) by making 2 changes to the 4-point LqSOFA: (1) the pulse rate parameter was replaced with the recently derived Temperature and Age-adjusted Mean Shock Index and (2) standard respiratory rate cutoffs for tachypnea were replaced by cutoffs derived empirically from the study cohort. The other 2 LqSOFA criteria were unchanged (abnormal mentation and capillary refill ≥3 seconds). We defined a positive qPS4 as ≥2 criteria (consistent with LqSOFA). We used the training cohort from the parent study to derive cutoffs for respiratory rate and the validation cohort to compare the qPS4 with LqSOFA and qSOFA. Among the 47,231 encounters in the validation cohort from the parent study, with median age of 4.5 years, qPS4 had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for septic shock of 0.94 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.92 to 0.96). qPS4 ≥2 had a sensitivity of 89.7% (95% CI 84.9% to 94.5%), and a specificity of 92.2% (95% CI 92.0% to 92.5%) for septic shock.

We consider the problem of detecting deterioration events with two stages: predicting the ""detection"" status, a pre-event state; and predicting the event from detection time. Our approach involves the development of dual-channel graph attention networks with multi-task learning strategy by jointly learning task relatedness with a shared model for multiple prediction in multivariate time-series. The experiments are conducted on two clinical time-series datasets collected from intensive care units (ICUs). Our model has shown the potential performance compared to other state-of-the-art methods, in terms of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC). The proposed dual-channel graph attention networks can explicitly learn the correlations in both features and time domains of multivariate time-series.

This study included 18,643 truckload entries from 45 farms, encompassing a total of 23,191,809 meat-type ducks sent to a single slaughterhouse in Eastern Thailand between January 2019 and December 2023. The objective of this study was twofold: first, to classify high DOA rates (≥ 0.15%) using several predictors, including season, period of the day, number of ducks per truckload, distance, duration of transportation, age, average body weight, lairage time, and temperature at the lairage area. This classification was performed using machine learning (ML) algorithms such as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Additionally, several data-sampling techniques, including oversampling, undersampling, Random Over-Sampling Examples (ROSE), and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), were utilized to address the issue of imbalanced data. Second, to analyze variable importance contributing to the predictive outcomes. The descriptive analysis revealed a mean DOA percentage of 0.14% (range: 0 to 22.46%, SD = 0.49). The results of the high DOA classification indicated that among all models, XGBoost-Up, XGBoost-Down, and RF-Down were the top three models, achieving the highest overall scores in evaluation metrics including Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), sensitivity, precision, and F1-score. The primary factors contributing to the high predictive performance of the models were the number of ducks per truckload, temperature at the lairage area, and average body weight. Additionally, the duration and distance of transportation, as well as the period of transportation, were secondary factors contributing to the outcome. These factors should be further investigated to minimize losses during the pre-slaughter phase in meat-type ducks.

Compared with the non-PNBM group, CSF NGAL was significantly higher in the PNBM group (305.1 [151.6-596.5] vs 58.5 [30.7-105.8] ng/mL; P < .0001). The area under the curve of CSF NGAL for diagnosing PNBM was 0.928 (95% CI: 0.897-0.960), at a threshold of 119.7 ng/mL. However, there was no significant difference in serum NGAL between the 2 groups (142.5 [105.0-248.6] vs 161.9 [126.6-246.6] ng/mL, P = .201). Furthermore, CSF NGAL levels were significantly higher in patients with gram-negative bacterial infections than those with gram-positive bacteria ( P = .023). In addition, CSF NGAL levels decrease after treatment compared with the initial stage of infection ( P < .0001). Finally, in this validation cohort, the threshold of 119.7 ng/mL CSF NGAL shows good diagnostic performance with a sensitivity and specificity of 90% and 80%, respectively. CSF NGAL holds promise as a potential biomarker for the diagnosis, early drug selection, and efficacy monitoring of PNBM.","2024","Neurosurgery"

Accumulating evidence suggests that hepatic inflammation is crucial in the onset and progression of insulin resistance (IR) and T2DM. However, the question of whether GFP can modulate T2DM via regulating hepatic inflammation and the underlying mechanism has not yet been reported. High-fat diet (HFD) fed combined with streptozocin (STZ) injections rat model and Lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-treated bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDM) model are used. The results showed that GFP intervention reduces weight loss and hyperglycemia symptoms, besides lowers FINS, HOMA-IR, IPGTT-AUC, and IPITT-AUC in T2DM rats. Meanwhile, GFP intervention reduces the secretion level of inflammatory factors and increases the secretion level of anti-inflammatory factors in the liver tissue of T2DM rats. Furthermore, GFP reduces macrophage infiltration in liver tissue, inhibits macrophage M1-type polarization, and promotes M2-type polarization. These results suggest that GFP intervention could attenuate the hepatic inflammatory and insulin resistance in T2DM rats by inhibiting hepatic macrophage infiltration and modulating M1/M2 polarization. The findings provide new evidence for GFP in the early prevention and treatment of T2DM.","2024","Molecular nutrition & food research"
449,"39645327","Emotional intersection: Delineating test anxiety, emotional disorders, and student well-being.","Previous studies have shown how test anxiety is positively related to symptoms of emotion disorder and that highly test anxious persons can meet diagnostic thresholds for emotion disorder. However, many studies are somewhat dated and based on older conceptualizations of key constructs. In addition, well-being is rarely considered alongside test anxiety and emotion disorder. In the present study, we addressed this limitation by using contemporaneous conceptualizations of test anxiety and emotion disorder, alongside school-related well-being (SRWB), using two analytic methods that are rarely combined to establish how constructs are related. The sample comprised 1167 participants (nmale = 500, nfemale = 621, nnon-binary = 21, ndeclined to report = 25; Mage = 15.4 years, SD = 1.81) from secondary and upper secondary education. Data were analyzed using psychometric network analysis and receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The psychometric network analysis showed that test anxiety, generalized anxiety, panic disorder, social anxiety, major depression, and SRWB formed distinct and largely coherent communities. Generalized anxiety was principally linked to the worry and tension components of test anxiety, panic disorder to the physiological indicator's component, social anxiety and SRWB to the worry and cognitive interference components, and major depression to the cognitive interference component. The ROC curve analysis indicated that test anxiety scores from the 63rd to 75th scale percentiles could predict clinical risk with relatively high accuracy (0.79-0.88) and acceptable levels of sensitivity (0.75-0.86) and specificity (0.70-0.77). Results suggest that test anxiety, emotion disorder, and SRWB are distinct, albeit related constructs. Although constrained by the cross-sectional design, our findings suggest that high test anxiety presents an elevated risk for the development of emotion disorder.","2024","Journal of school psychology"

We collected data on patients with AP in the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV database. The enrolled observations were randomly divided into a 70 % training cohort and a 30 % validation cohort, and the observations in the training cohort were divided into ARF and non-ARF groups. Feature engineering was conducted using random forest (RF) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) methods in the training cohort. The model building included logistic regression (LR), decision tree (DT), k-nearest neighbours (KNN), naive bayes (NB) and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Parameters for model evaluation include receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, precision-recall curve (PRC), calibration curves, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), true positive rate (TPR), true negative rate (TNR), accuracy (ACC) and F1 score. Among 4527 patients, 445 patients (9.8 %) experienced ARF. Ca, ALB, GLR, WBC, AG and BUN have been included in the prediction model as features for predicting ARF. The AUC of XGBoost were 0.86 (95 %CI 0.84-0.88) and 0.87 (95 %CI 0.84-0.90) in the training and validation cohorts. In the training cohort, XGBoost demonstrates a true positive rate (TPR) of 0.662, a true negative rate (TNR) of 0.884, a positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.380, a negative predictive value (NPV) of 0.960, an accuracy (ACC) of 0.862, and an F1 score of 0.483.

However, the optimal biomarker for predicting prognosis remains unclear. This study aimed to identify the optimal indicators of survival among the nutrition-based, inflammation-based and muscle mass-related markers for ALS patients. We enrolled ALS patients from January 2014 to December 2019. Experienced neurologists followed up with the participants until January 2022. This study included a total of 17 nutritional, systemic inflammatory or muscle mass-related indicators. Maximally selected rank statistics determined the cut-off points for these indicators. Kaplan-Meier estimation was used to assess survival. Uni- and multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the effects of indicators on survival. Finally, time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (time-ROC) curves and the C-index were calculated to evaluate the predictive efficacy of different indicators. A total of 506 patients with ALS were enrolled in this study, including 288 males (56.9%) and 218 females (43.1%), with a mean age of 54.2 ± 10.5 years. Among these ALS patients, 334 cases (68.0%) either died or underwent tracheotomy. In univariate Cox proportional hazards regression, 11 indicators were significantly associated with ALS survival (p < 0.05). And systemic immune inflammation (SII), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), modified geriatric nutritional risk index (mGNRI), creatinine and sarcopenia index (SI, (creatinine/cystatin C) × 100) were determined as independent predictors (p < 0.05) in multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression. A higher SI predicted longer survival (hazard ratio, 0.59; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.46-0.76; p < 0.001). The results of time-ROC and C-index analyses indicated that SI had the best predictive efficacy for ALS survival, with a C-index of 0.65 (95% CI, 0.54-0.75) for 1-year, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.57-0.65) for 3-year and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.55-0.62) for 5-year survival. Across different subgroups, SI had the highest C-index in men and women, limb onset and aged < 60 year ALS patients, compared with other indicators. However, cystatin C was the best indicator for predicting the survival of ALS patients with bulbar onset, whereas the prognostic nutritional index (PNI) was the best for those aged ≥60 years. The serum SI demonstrates superior prognostic ability compared to other inflammation-based, nutrition-based and muscle mass-related indicators for patients with ALS. Given its simplicity and availability, it is well suited for clinical use in evaluating the prognosis of ALS patients.","2024","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle"

Multicenter retrospective cohort study. Ten Level I Trauma Centers. The inclusion criteria were patients with distal femur fractures (OTA/AO 33A and 33 C) treated with intramedullary nails, with a minimum follow-up of 1 year or until radiographic union or reoperation. The exclusion criteria were fractures treated with combination nail-plate constructs, pathologic fractures, and patients younger than 18 years old. The primary outcome was the mRUST score at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified the optimal 3-month mRUST score predicting reoperation. Multivariable models were used to identify predictors of radiographic union timing and delayed progression. The study included 155 fractures in 152 patients, with a mean patient age of 51 and a mean follow-up of 17 months. A 3-month mRUST score of ≤8 predicted reoperation with a PPV of 25% and a NPV of 99%. The timing of radiographic union was associated with tobacco use (1.2 months later; P = 0.04), open fracture (1.4 months later; P = 0.04), and the use of topical antibiotics (2.1 months longer; 95% CI, 0.33-3.84; P = 0.02); however, topical antibiotics were at high risk of being confounded by injury severity. Delayed progression to fracture healing, wherein the most rapid radiographic healing occurs more than 3 months postoperatively, was predicted by chronic kidney disease ( P < 0.01). A 3-month mRUST score >8 suggests a very high likelihood of avoiding reoperation for nonunion. Tobacco use and open fractures were associated with a longer time to radiographic union. Chronic kidney disease is associated with a delayed radiographic progression, suggesting a need for adjusted expectations and management strategies in these patients. Prognostic Level III.

Convolutional neural networks have been recently proposed as a viable option for tasks such as malaria detection, prediction of host-pathogen interactions, or drug discovery. Our research aimed to predict the transition of Plasmodium-infected liver cells to the merozoite stage, a key development phase, 15 hours in advance. We collected and analyzed hourly imaging data over a span of at least 38 hours from 400 sequences, encompassing 502 parasites. Our method was compared to human annotations to validate its efficacy. Performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, were evaluated on an independent test dataset. The outcomes revealed an AUC of 0.873, a sensitivity of 84.6%, and a specificity of 83.3%, underscoring the potential of our CNN-based framework to predict liver stage development of P. berghei. These findings not only demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology but also could potentially contribute to the broader understanding of parasite biology.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

Patients with at least one BI-RADS 2-6 BL who performed breast US integrated with SWE were retrospectively included. B-mode US and SWE images were manually segmented to extract radiomics features. A multi-step feature selection process was performed and a predictive model built using the Logistic Regression algorithm. The diagnostic accuracy was evaluated with the AUC and Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) metrics. The performance of the ML classifier was compared to that of an expert radiologist. 427 Bls were included and divided into a training (286 BLs, of which 127 benign and 159 malignant) and a test set (141 BLs, of which 59 benign and 82 malignant). Of 1098 features extracted from B-mode US and SWE images, 13 were finally selected. The ML classifier showed an AUC of 0.768 and 0.746, and an MCC of 0.403 and 0.423 in the training and test sets, respectively. The performance was higher than that of the expert radiologist assessing only B-mode US images, but significantly lower when SWE images were also provided. A ML approach based on B-mode US and SWE images may represent a potential tool in the characterization of BLs.

However, the safety and effectiveness of using prophylactic anticoagulants for preventing DVT after spinal surgery remain controversial. Hence, it is crucial to predict whether DVT occurs in advance following spinal surgery. The present study aimed to establish a machine learning (ML)-based prediction model of DVT formation following spinal surgery. We reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent elective spinal surgery at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (TAHZMU) from January 2020 to December 2022. We ultimately selected the clinical data of 500 patients who met the criteria for elective spinal surgery. The Boruta-SHAP algorithm was used for feature selection, and the SMOTE algorithm was used for data balance. The related risk factors for DVT after spinal surgery were screened and analyzed. Five ML algorithm models were established. The data of 150 patients treated at the Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi Medical University (AHZMU) from July 2023 to October 2023 were used for external verification of the model. The area under the curve (AUC), geometric mean (G-mean), sensitivity, accuracy, specificity, and F1 score were used to evaluate the performance of the models. The results revealed that activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT), age, body mass index (BMI), preoperative serum creatinine (Crea), anesthesia time, rocuronium dose, and propofol dose were the seven important characteristic variables for predicting DVT after spinal surgery. Among the five ML models established in this study, the random forest classifier (RF) showed superior performance to the other models in the internal validation set. Seven preoperative and intraoperative variables were included in our study to develop an ML-based predictive model for DVT formation following spinal surgery, and this model can be used to assist in clinical evaluation and decision-making.","2024","International journal of medical informatics"

The rapid expansion of Ae. Aegypti and Ae. albopictus breeding habitats is a significant threat to global public health, driven by temperature and precipitation changes. In this study, bioclimatic variables were employed to predict the spatial distribution of Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus in India. The reference coordinate points of (n = 583) Aedes occurrences at a scale of ∼1 km and nineteen bioclimatic factors were retrieved to train SDM (Species Distribution Models) for both species. Maximum entropy modelling was used to predict the species' fundamental climatic niche distributions. Future projections were made using global climate models for 2021-2040 and 2081-2100 separately. The models performed reasonably well (AUC > 0.77). Both species thrived in reduced diurnal temperature and higher annual mean temperatures, with suitability increasing alongside precipitation. Ae. aegypti's projected present and future distribution was broader than that of Ae. Albopictus. The expansion of Aedes suitability varied under different future climatic scenarios. Suitability for Ae. aegypti could expand from between 17.6 and 41.1 % in 2100 under SSP (shared socioeconomic pathways) scenarios 1 and 3, respectively, whereas for Ae. albopictus suitability increased from between 10.2 and 25 % under SSP scenarios 1 and 3 respectively.

All patients were randomly classified into a training cohort and a validation cohort. Six algorithms, including logistic regression (LR), extreme gradient boosting machine (eXGBM), support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), neural network (NN), and decision tree (DT), were used to develop and optimize models in the training cohort, and internal validation of these models were conducted in the validation cohort. Based on a comprehensive scoring system, which incorporated ten evaluation metrics, the optimal model was obtained with the highest scores. An artificial intelligence (AI) application was deployed based on the optimal model in the study.Results: The in-hospital mortality was 19.69%. Among all developed models, the eXGBM had the highest area under the curve (AUC) value (0.951, 95%CI: 0.934-0.967), and it also showed the highest accuracy (0.902), precise (0.893), recall (0.915), and F1 score (0.904). Based on the scoring system, the eXGBM had the highest score of 53, followed by the RF model (43) and the NN model (39). The scores for the LR, SVM, and DT were 22, 36, and 17, respectively. The decision curve analysis confirmed that both the eXGBM and RF models provided substantial clinical net benefits. However, the eXGBM model consistently outperformed the RF model across multiple evaluation metrics, establishing itself as the superior option for predictive modeling in this scenario, with the RF model as a strong secondary choice.

This study aimed to develop and evaluate predictive modelling approaches to predict the achievement of minimal clinically important difference (MCID) in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) 1 year after TKA. Four hundred thirty robotic-assisted TKAs were analysed in this retrospective study. The mean age was 67.9 ± 7.9 years; the mean body mass index (BMI) was 32.0 ± 6.8 kg/m2. The following PROMs were collected preoperatively and 1-year postoperatively: knee injury and osteoarthritis outcome score for joint replacement, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities osteoarthritis index (WOMAC) Function, WOMAC Pain. Demographic data, preoperative CT scan, implant size, implant position on the robotic system and characteristics of the joint replacement procedure were selected as predictive variables. Four machine learning algorithms were trained to predict the MCID status at 1-year post-TKA for each PROM survey. 'No MCID' was chosen as the target. Models were evaluated by class discrimination (F1-score) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC). The best-performing model was ridge logistic regression for WOMAC Function (area under the curve [AUC]  = 0.80, F1 = 0.48, sensitivity = 0.79, specificity = 0.62). Variables most strongly contributing to not achieving MCID status were preoperative PROMs, high BMI and femoral resection depth (posterior and distal), supporting functional positioning principles. Conversely, variables contributing to a positive outcome (achieving MCID) were medial/lateral alignment of the tibial component, whether the procedure was an outpatient surgery and whether the patient received managed Medicare insurance. The most predictive variables included preoperative PROMs, BMI and surgical planning. The surgical predictive variables were valgus femoral alignment and femoral rotation, reflecting the benefits of personalised surgery. Including surgical variables in predictive models for functional outcomes after TKA should guide clinical and surgical decision-making for every patient.

For development of the DIAS3 score, data from the International CVT Consortium (n = 1128), a large international hospital-based multicenter CVT cohort, were used. For validation, data from 2 independent multicenter cohorts, the ACTION-CVT (n = 543) and the Israel CVT study (n = 556), were used. Of 2937 eligible, consecutively enrolled adult patients with radiologically verified CVT, 710 patients with a history of epilepsy prior to CVT, follow-up less than 8 days, and missing late seizure status were excluded. The prediction score (DIAS3) was developed based on available literature and clinical plausibility and consisted of 6 readily available clinical variables collected during the acute phase: decompressive hemicraniectomy, intracerebral hemorrhage at presentation, age, seizure(s) in the acute phase (excluding status epilepticus), status epilepticus in the acute phase, and subdural hematoma at presentation. Time to a first late seizure, defined as occurring more than 7 days after diagnosis of CVT. Of 1128 patients included in the derivation cohort (median age, 41 [IQR, 30-53] years; 805 women [71%]), 128 (11%) developed post-CVT epilepsy during a median follow-up of 12 (IQR, 3-26) months. According to the DIAS3 score, the predicted 1-year and 3-year risk of epilepsy in individual patients ranged from 7% to 68% and 10% to 83%, respectively. Internal and external validation showed adequate discrimination in the derivation cohort (1 year and 3 years: C statistic, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.70-0.79) and the 2 independent validation cohorts, (ACTION-CVT) 1 year: C statistic, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.67-0.84; 3 years: C statistic, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.66-0.84; and Israel CVT study 1 year: C statistic, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.75-0.86. Calibration plots indicated adequate agreement between predicted and observed risks. The DIAS3 score (freely available online) is a simple tool that can help predict the risk of post-CVT epilepsy in individual patients.

We therefore designed a prospective study to elucidate risk factors for postoperative complications with a focus on frailty. We prospectively analyzed 241 patients with spinal metastasis who underwent palliative surgery from June 2015 to December 2021. Postoperative complications were assessed by the Clavien-Dindo classification; scores of ≥ Grade II were defined as complications. Data were collected regarding demographics (age, sex, BMI, and primary cancer) and preoperative clinical factors (new Katagiri score, Frankel grade, performance status, radiotherapy, chemotherapy, spinal instability neoplastic score, modified Frailty Index-11 (mFI), diabetes, and serum albumin levels). Univariate and multivariate analyses were developed to identify risk factors for postoperative complications (p < 0.05). Overall, 57 postoperative complications occurred in 47 of 241 (19.5%) patients. The most common complications were wound infection/dehiscence, urinary tract infection, and pneumonia. Univariate analysis identified preoperative radiotherapy (p = 0.028), mFI (p < 0.001), blood loss ≥ 500 ml (p = 0.016), and preoperative molecular targeted drugs (p = 0.030) as potential risk factors. From the receiver operating characteristic curve, the clinically optimal cut-off value of mFI was 0.27 (sensitivity, 46.8%; specificity, 79.9%). Multivariate analysis identified mFI ≥ 0.27 (odds ratio (OR) 2.94 (95% CI 1.44 to 5.98); p = 0.003) and preoperative radiotherapy (OR 2.11 (95% CI 1.00 to 4.46); p = 0.049) as significant risk factors. In particular, urinary tract infection (p = 0.012) and pneumonia (p = 0.037) were associated with mFI ≥ 0.27.

464,"38955592","DeepSAP: A Novel Brain Image-Based Deep Learning Model for Predicting Stroke-Associated Pneumonia From Spontaneous Intracerebral Hemorrhage.","Stroke-associated pneumonia (SAP) often appears as a complication following intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH), leading to poor prognosis and increased mortality rates. Previous studies have typically developed prediction models based on clinical data alone, without considering that ICH patients often undergo CT scans immediately upon admission. As a result, these models are subjective and lack real-time applicability, with low accuracy that does not meet clinical needs. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a quick and reliable model to timely predict SAP. In this retrospective study, we developed an image-based model (DeepSAP) using brain CT scans from 244 ICH patients to classify the presence and severity of SAP. First, DeepSAP employs MRI-template-based image registration technology to eliminate structural differences between samples, achieving statistical quantification and spatial standardization of cerebral hemorrhage. Subsequently, the processed images and filtered clinical data were simultaneously input into a deep-learning neural network for training and analysis. The model was tested on a test set to evaluate diagnostic performance, including accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity. Brain CT scans from 244 ICH patients (mean age, 60.24; 66 female) were divided into a training set (n = 170) and a test set (n = 74). The cohort included 143 SAP patients, accounting for 58.6% of the total, with 66 cases classified as moderate or above, representing 27% of the total. Experimental results showed an AUC of 0.93, an accuracy of 0.84, a sensitivity of 0.79, and a precision of 0.95 for classifying the presence of SAP. In comparison, the model relying solely on clinical data showed an AUC of only 0.76, while the radiomics method had an AUC of 0.74. Additionally, DeepSAP achieved an optimal AUC of 0.84 for the SAP grading task. DeepSAP's accuracy in predicting SAP stems from its spatial normalization and statistical quantification of the ICH region. DeepSAP is expected to be an effective tool for predicting and grading SAP in clinic.","2024","Academic radiology"

Meanwhile, it is commonly believed that the facet joints and paraspinal muscles participate in maintaining cervical spine stability. However, the impact of paraspinal muscle morphology and detailed facet joint features on DCS requires further investigation. To compare facet joint characteristics, disc degeneration and muscle morphology between patients with DCS and those without DCS. Retrospective cohort study. Consecutive surgical patients with degenerative cervical spondylosis from June 2016 to August 2023 were recruited. DCS was assessed on X-ray based on the translation distance. Cervical facet joint degeneration (CFD), the facet joint angle on the axial plane (FA-A) and the facet joint angle on the sagittal plane (FA-S), and facet joint tropism (FT) were measured on computerized tomography (CT). Paraspinal muscle degeneration was assessed on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) including by the adjusted cross-sectional area (aCSA), the functional aCSA, the fat infiltration ratio (FI%). The Pfirrmann grade of the cervical disc was also evaluated. Demographic and clinical data were compared in matched and unmatched cohorts. Disc degeneration, muscle degeneration and facet joint characteristics, including FA, FT and CFD, were compared between patients with and without DCS. Furthermore, the degree of CFD was compared with that of adjacent segments in both groups. Additionally, logistic regression was performed to determine independent risk factors for DCS. Finally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under the curve (AUC) and cutoff value for the risk factors were calculated. A total of 431 surgical patients were propensity score matched for age, sex and BMI, and 146 patients were included in the final analysis, with 73 patients in the DCS group and 73 patients in the non-DCS group. DCS patients exhibited more severe CFD at C4/5 (segment with spondylolisthesis). Additionally, DCS was generally associated with more severe CFD, a more horizontal FA-S, more FT and worse paraspinal muscle health but similar disc degeneration. In addition, anterior spondylolisthesis was related to more severe CFD and decreased functional aCSA of the flexors and extensors. Finally, more severe CFD, a more horizontal FA-S and a higher FI% on deep extensor were revealed to be risk factors for DCS, with cutoff values of 1.5, 44.5̊, and 37.1%, respectively. This study demonstrated that CFD, the FA and FT and parasipnal muscle degeneration were associated with DCS. And may provide novel insight into the pathogenesis and nature history of DCS and suggest the evolution of degeneration in the cervical spine.","2024","The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society"

Radiomic features were extracted based on native T1 maps using a freely available software package. We applied LASSO logistic regression method to select radiomic features with high diagnostic value of AL-CA and develop a predictive model. The diagnostic performance of the radiomics model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and compared to T1 values. A total of 70 people were diagnosed with AL-CA, and cardiac involvement was observed in 202 myocardial slicers. The accuracy of T1 values for the diagnosis of myocardial involvement was 0.886, with a threshold value of 1375 ms. The radiomics score comprised a total of three features. The radiomics score demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity in detecting myocardial involvement compared to T1 values in both the training set (AUC 0.886 vs. 0.924, P = 0.025) and the test set (0.862 vs 0.915, P = 0.026).

This study aimed to investigate plasma PCT concentration variations in pre-weaned dairy calves categorized as BRD-positive using clinical scores (WRSC; BRD-positive ≥5), thoracic ultrasonography with two cut-off (TUS; BRD-positive ≥1 or ≥3), or a combination of both methods (WRSC/TUS1cm or WRSC/TUS3cm). Additionally, the accuracy of PCT in diagnosing BRD was evaluated. A cross-sectional study was conducted on a convenience sample of 226 pre-weaned Italian-Friesian female calves. Clinical scoring, TUS, and plasma PCT analysis were performed. Calves were categorized based on TUS findings, clinical scores, or a combination of both methods. Statistical analyses were conducted to assess the differences in PCT concentrations among different groups and to determine the diagnostic accuracy of PCT. Results showed a significant increase in PCT levels in calves with lung consolidation detected by TUS using a 1 cm cutoff. However, the diagnostic accuracy of PCT in discriminating BRD-positive cases was poor (area under the curve 0.62). The optimal cutoff value for PCT was determined to be 86.63 pg/mL, with sensitivity of 49.7%, specificity of 71.8%, positive predictive value of 79.4% and negative predictive value of 39.5%. In conclusion, while PCT showed potential as a biomarker for BRD, its diagnostic accuracy was limited in this study.

This observational multicentre cohort study included 425 patients admitted to intensive care after cardiac arrest. Plasma p-tau231 was retrospectively analysed at admission, 12 and 48 h after cardiac arrest. The association of the Cerebral Performance Category (CPC) with p-tau231 was analysed with a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). CPC was modelled using multivariate ordinal logistic regression, and the biomarkers' prognostic performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Increasing p-tau231 levels were significantly associated with worse CPC (p < 0.001). P-tau231 showed moderate prognostic abilities (AUC: 0.69 on admission, 0.72 at 12 h, and 0.71 at 48 h) for all patients but did not improve neurological prognostication after adjusting for clinical covariates.

However, there is no biomarker to predict if a patient would respond to bevacizumab. We aimed to develop a cluster-based radiomics approach to characterize the spatial heterogeneity of RN and map their responses to bevacizumab. 118 consecutive nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients diagnosed with RN were enrolled. We divided 152 lesions from the patients into 101 for training, and 51 for validation. We extracted voxel-level radiomics features from each lesion segmented on T1-weighted+contrast and T2 FLAIR sequences of pre- and post-bevacizumab magnetic resonance images, followed by a three-step analysis involving individual- and population-level clustering, before delta-radiomics to derive five radiomics clusters within the lesions. We tested the association of each cluster with response to bevacizumab and developed a clinico-radiomics model using clinical predictors and cluster-specific features. 71 (70.3%) and 34 (66.7%) lesions had responded to bevacizumab in the training and validation datasets, respectively. Two radiomics clusters were spatially mapped to the edema region, and the volume changes were significantly associated with bevacizumab response (OR:11.12 [95% CI: 2.54-73.47], P = 0.004; and 1.63[1.07-2.78], P = 0.042).

However, these WSIs typically contain non-cancer tissue, introducing noise during model training. As digital pathology models typically start with splitting WSIs into tiles, we propose a model that can be used to exclude non-cancer tiles from the WSIs of lung squamous cell carcinoma (SqCC) tumours. We obtained 116 WSIs of tumours from 35 different centres from the Cancer Genome Atlas. A pathologist completed or reviewed cancer contours in four regions of interest (ROIs) within each WSIs. We then split the ROIs into tiles labelled with the percentage of cancer tissue within them and trained VGG16 to predict this value, and then we calculated regression error. To measure classification performance and visualize the classification results, we thresholded the predictions and calculated the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The model's median regression error was 4% with a standard deviation of 35%. At a cancer threshold of 50%, the model had an AUC of 0.83. False positives tended to be in tissues that surround cancer, tiles with <50% cancer, and areas with high immune activity. False negatives tended to be microtomy defects. With further validation for each specific research application, the model we describe in this paper could facilitate the development of more effective research pipelines for predicting treatment biomarkers for lung SqCC.","2025","Computers in biology and medicine"

In the current study we aimed to develop easily employable prediction models to predict TR in positive and negative symptom domains from first episode psychosis (FEP). Longitudinal cohort data from 1027 individuals with FEP was utilised. Using a robust definition of TR, n = 51 (4.97 %) participants were treatment resistant in the positive domain and n = 56 (5.46 %) treatment resistant in the negative domain 12 months after first presentation. 20 predictor variables, selected by existing evidence and availability in clinical practice, were entered into two LASSO regression models. We estimated the models using repeated nested cross-validation (NCV) and assessed performance using discrimination and calibration measures. The prediction model for TR in the positive domain showed good discrimination (AUC = 0.72). Twelve predictor variables (male gender, cannabis use, age, positive symptom severity, depression and academic and social functioning) were retained by each outer fold of the NCV procedure, indicating importance in prediction of the outcome. However, our negative domain model failed to discriminate those with and without TR, with results only just over chance (AUC = 0.56).

Multivariable Cox regression models, cubic spline restricted models and Kaplan-Meier curves were used to evaluate the relationship between NTproBNP and both all-cause mortality and cardiovascular mortality. Predictive models were established using seven machine learning methods, and evaluation was conducted using precision, recall, F1 score, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC) values. During the population follow-up, out of 6772 participants, 1554 died, with 365 deaths attributed to cardiovascular disease. After adjusting for relevant covariates, NTproBNP levels ≥300 pg/mL were positively associated with both all-cause mortality (hazard ratio [HR] 3.00, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.48, 3.67) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 6.05, 95% CI 3.67, 9.97), and remained significant across different body mass index (BMI) strata.

FFR-CT exploits computational fluid dynamics (CFD) for non-invasive evaluation of FFR, simulating coronary flow in virtual geometries reconstructed from computed tomography (CT), but suffers from cost-intensive computing process and uncertainties in the definition of patient specific boundary conditions (BCs). In this work, we investigated the use of time-averaged steady BCs, compared to pulsatile to reduce the computational time and deployed a self-adjusting method for the tuning of BCs to patient-specific clinical data. 133 coronary arteries were reconstructed form CT images of patients suffering from CAD. For each vessel, invasive FFR was measured. After segmentation, the geometries were prepared for CFD simulation by clipping the outlets and discretizing into tetrahedral mesh. Steady BCs were defined in two steps: (i) rest BCs were extrapolated from clinical and image-derived data; (ii) hyperemic BCs were computed from resting conditions. Flow rate was iteratively adjusted during the simulation, until patient's aortic pressure was matched. Pulsatile BCs were defined exploiting the convergence values of steady BCs. After CFD simulation, lesion-specific hemodynamic indexes were computed and compared between group of patients for which surgery was indicated and not. The whole pipeline was implemented as a straightforward process, in which each single step is performed automatically. Steady and pulsatile FFR-CT yielded a strong correlation (r = 0.988, p < 0.001) and correlated with invasive FFR (r = 0.797, p < 0.001). The per-point difference between the pressure and FFR-CT field predicted by the two methods was below 1 % and 2 %, respectively. Both approaches exhibited a good diagnostic performance: accuracy was 0.860 and 0.864, the AUC was 0.923 and 0.912, for steady and pulsatile case, respectively. The computational time required by steady BCs CFD was approximatively 30-folds lower than pulsatile case. This work shows the feasibility of using steady BCs CFD for computing the FFR-CT in coronary arteries, as well as its computational and diagnostic performance within a fully automated pipeline.","2024","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

Patients from MIMIC databases were randomly divided into 80 % training and 20 % validation cohorts, while those from eICU-CRD constituted the test cohort. Feature selection involved univariate logistic regression (LR), LASSO, and Boruta methods. Prediction models for RRT were developed using stepwise selection by LR and five machine learning (ML) algorithms (naive bayes, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, extreme gradient boosting) in the training cohort. Model performance was evaluated in both validation and test cohorts. A nomogram was constructed based on LR model. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis assessed 28-day mortality. The incidence of RRT was approximately 13 % across all cohorts. Ten variables were selected: age, anion gap, chloride, bun, creatinine, potassium, ast, lactate, estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and mechanical ventilation. Compared with ML models, the LR model showed superior predictive performance with an AUC of 0.731 in the validation cohort and 0.714 in the test cohort. Four variables that best predicted the need for RRT (age, lactate, mechanical ventilation, and creatinine) were used to generate the CMLA nomogram risk score. The CMLA model showed better predictive accuracy for RRT in the test cohort compared to the previous CALL-K model (AUC: 0.731 vs. 0.699, DeLong test P < 0.05). Calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that the CMLA model also had good calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P=0.323) and clinical utility in the test cohort.

An accurate early diagnosis is necessary for starting nutritional support, as both are clearly associated with clinical outcomes and mortality. We aimed to evaluate the applicability and accuracy of body composition analysis using electrical bioimpedance vectorial analysis (BIVA) for diagnosing malnutrition and sarcopenia in patients with HNC cancer undergoing systemic treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy. Cross-sectional, observational study that included 509 HNC patients. A comprehensive nutritional evaluation that included BIVA was performed. The prevalence of malnutrition was higher in patients that received treatment with chemotherapy (59.2% vs. 40.8%, P < 0.001); increased mortality was observed in malnourished patients (33.3% vs. 20.1%; P < 0.001); ECOG status (1-4) was also worse in malnourished patients (59.2% vs. 22.8% P < 0.001). Body cell mass (BCM) and fat mass were the most significantly associated parameters with malnutrition [OR 0.88 (0.84-0.93) and 0.98 (0.95-1.01), respectively]; BCM and fat free mass index (FFMI) were associated with several aspects including (1) the patient-generated subjective global assessment [OR 0.93 (0.84-0.98) and 0.86 (0.76-0.97), respectively], (2) the presence of sarcopenia [OR 0.81 (0.76-0.87) and 0.78 (0.66-0.92), respectively]. A BCM index (BCMI) < 7.8 in combination with other parameters including FFMI and BCM accurately predicted patients with malnutrition [accuracy 95% CI: 0.803 (0.763-0.839); kappa index: 0.486; AUC: 0.618 (P < 0.01)]. A BCMI cutoff of 7.6 was enough for identifying males with malnutrition (P < 0.001), while it should be combined with other parameters in females. Body composition parameters determined by BIVA accurately identify patients with HNC and malnutrition. Phase angle, but other parameters including BCMI, FFMI and BCM provide significant information about nutritional status in patients with HNC.","2024","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle"

Traditional laboratory test monitoring is resource-heavy, invasive, and unable to provide continuous tracking. Wearable technologies like smartwatches with electrocardiogram (ECG) capabilities are emerging as valuable tools for remote monitoring, potentially allowing for personalized monitoring with artificial intelligence (AI)-ECG interpretation. The purpose of this study was to develop an AI-ECG algorithm to predict serum potassium level in ESRD patients with smartwatch-generated ECG waveforms. A cohort of 152,508 patients with 293,557 ECGs paired serum potassium levels obtained within 1 hour at Cedars Sinai Medical Center was used to train an AI-ECG model (""Kardio-Net"") to predict serum potassium level. The model was further fine-tuned on 4,337 ECGs from 1,463 patients with ESRD using inputs from 12- and single-lead ECGs. Kardio-Net was evaluated in held-out test cohorts from Cedars Sinai Medical Center and Stanford Healthcare (SHC) as well as a prospective international cohort of 40 ESRD patients with smartwatch ECGs at Chang Gung Memorial Hospital. The Kardio-Net, when applied to 12-lead ECGs, identified severe hyperkalemia (>6.5 mEq/L) with an AUC of 0.852 (95% CI: 0.745-0.956) and a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.527 mEq/L. In external validation at SHC, the model achieved an AUC of 0.849 (95% CI: 0.823-0.875) and an MAE of 0.599 mEq/L. For single-lead ECGs, Kardio-Net detected severe hyperkalemia with an AUC of 0.876 (95% CI: 0.765-0.987) in the primary cohort and had an MAE of 0.575 mEq/L. In the external SHC validation, the AUC was 0.807 (95% CI: 0.778-0.835) with an MAE of 0.740 mEq/L. Using prospectively obtained smartwatch data, the AUC was 0.831 (95% CI: 0.693-0.975), with an MAE of 0.580 mEq/L. We validate a deep learning model to predict serum potassium levels from both 12-lead ECGs and single-lead smartwatch data, demonstrating its utility for remote monitoring of hyperkalemia.","2024","JACC.

This study investigated this association among healthy Korean adults with normal kidney function. Prospective cohort study. We analyzed 5,221 participants without CKD in the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study. Cumulative systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) loads were calculated as the ratios of the areas under the curve (AUC) for SBP≥120mm Hg or≥80mm Hg for DBP divided by the AUC for all SBP or DBP measurements during the exposure period. These AUCs were categorized into 4 groups: group 0 (reference), cumulative BP load of 0 and groups 1-3, tertiles of cumulative BP loads. Primary end point was incident CKD defined as a composite of an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 60mL/min/1.73m2 or proteinuria greater than 1+on dipstick examination for at least 2 consecutive measurements≥90 days apart. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression to estimate the independent association of cumulative BP loads with incident CKD. Higher cumulative SBP and DBP loads were associated with an increased risk of incident CKD (HR, 1.23 [95% CI, 1.12-1.35] for SBP; and HR, 1.14 [95% CI, 1.04-1.26] for DBP loads for each 1.0-unit greater load). Compared with SBP group 0, groups 2 and 3 were associated with 1.94- and 1.89-fold greater risk of incident CKD. Compared with DBP group 0, groups 2 and 3 were associated with 1.42- and 1.54-fold greater risks. These associations of high cumulative BP loads with an increased risk of incident CKD remained consistent even in the subgroups not taking antihypertensive agents or without prior hypertension diagnosis. The assessment of CKD outcomes relied on eGFR and spot urine tests. These findings highlight the association between high cumulative SBP and DBP loads and the occurrence of CKD, even in individuals with normal BP levels. Although hypertension is a major risk factor for chronic kidney disease (CKD), most studies have focused on single-point blood pressure (BP) measurements. To explore the association between long-term cumulative BP load and the development of CKD, 5,221 Korean adults with normal kidney function were included in this study. Cumulative systolic BP and diastolic BP load both exhibited a significant association with an increased risk of incident CKD. Notably, the association of cumulative BP loads with elevated risk of incident CKD was evident also in individuals who were not taking antihypertensive agents or who had no previous history of hypertension. These findings underscore the importance of managing long-term exposure to high BP, even in individuals with normal BP levels.","2024","American journal of kidney diseases : the official journal of the National Kidney Foundation"

However, the huge vascular stimulation, poor aqueous solubility, and short half-life restricted its clinical use. In this work, an effective nanocarrier was explored to reduce toxicity and enhance the tumor-targeted delivery. Two liposomal formulations, neogambogic acid liposomes (NGA-L), and hyaluronic acid-coated neogambogic acid liposomes (HA-NGA-L) were prepared and characterized with high encapsulation efficiency, slow pattern of drug release, narrow size distribution and higher stability. The cytotoxicity and cellular uptake of HA-NGA-L were higher than those of NGA-L in MDA-MB-231 cells (high CD44 expression), while no obvious differences in MCF-7 cells with (low CD44 expression), suggesting the CD44-mediated cellular internalization of hyaluronic acid-modified liposomes enhanced the cytotoxicity. Mechanistically, elevation of Bax and caspase-3 as well as downregulation of Bcl-2 led to cell apoptosis. Besides, the vascular stimulation and the hemolysis test indicated good safety of HA-NGA-L. In addition, HA-NGA-L was the effective nanocarrier to repress tumor proliferation in MDA-MB-231 tumor xenograft mouse through CD44 mediated active targeting without any obvious histopathological abnormities on major organs. Immunohistochemistry analysis revealed the enhanced elevation of Bax and caspase-3, and reduced expression of Bcl-2 contribute to apoptosis in tumors. Meanwhile, HA-NGA-L increased the AUC and t1/2 by 5.34-fold and 3.94-fold, respectively. In summary, the present study shows that HA-NGA-L may be safe and effective for the tumor-targeted delivery of neogambogic acid.","2024","Journal of liposome research"

We realized a pipeline that relies on survival machine-learning (SML) classifiers and explainability based on patients' follow-up (FU) to stratify prognosis from the public-available multi-omic datasets of the CPTAC-PDA project. Analyzed datasets included tumor-annotated radiologic images, clinical, and mutational data. A feature selection was based on univariate (UV) and multivariate (MV) survival analyses according to Overall Survival (OS) and recurrence (REC). In this study, we considered seven multi-omic datasets and compared four SML classifiers: Cox, survival random forest, generalized boosted, and support vector machines (SVM). For each classifier, we assessed the concordance (C) index on the validation set. The best classifiers for the validation set on both OS and REC underwent explainability analyses using SurvSHAP(t), which extends SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). According to OS, after UV and MV analyses we selected 18/37 and 10/37 multi-omic features, respectively. According to REC, based on UV and MV analyses we selected 10/35 and 5/35 determinants, respectively. Generally, SML classifiers including radiomics outperformed those modelled on clinical or mutational predictors. For OS, the Cox model encompassing radiomic, clinical, and mutational features reached 75 % of C index, outperforming other classifiers. On the other hand, for REC, the SVM model including only radiomics emerged as the best-performing, with 68 % of C index. For OS, SurvSHAP(t) identified the first order Median Gray Level (GL) intensities, the gender, the tumor grade, the Joint Energy GL Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM), and the GLCM Informational Measures of Correlations of type 1 as the most important features. For REC, the first order Median GL intensities, the GL size zone matrix Small Area Low GL Emphasis, and first order variance of GL intensities emerged as the most discriminative. In this work, radiomics showed the potential for improving patients' risk stratification in PDA. Furthermore, a deeper understanding of how radiomics can contribute to prognosis in PDA was achieved with a time-dependent explainability of the top multi-omic predictors.","2024","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

This study aimed to investigate potential intercellular crosstalk and its impact on clinical outcomes and therapeutic responses. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), spatial transcriptomics (ST) and bulk RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) datasets were integrated to comprehensively analyze the intercellular interactions within the TME. Multiplex immunohistochemistry was conducted to validate the intercellular interactions. A machine learning-based integrative procedure was used in bulk RNA-seq datasets to generate a risk model to predict prognosis and therapeutic responses. Survival analyses based on the bulk RNA-seq datasets revealed the negative impact of the naïve Cluster of Differentiation 4+ (CD4) T cells and Secreted Phosphoprotein 1+ (SPP1) macrophages on prognosis. Furthermore, their intricate intercellular crosstalk and spatial colocalization were also observed by scRNA-seq and ST analyses. Based on this crosstalk, a machine learning model, termed the naïve CD4+ T cell and SPP1+ macrophage prognostic score (TMPS), was established in the bulk-RNA seq datasets for prognostic prediction. The TMPS achieved C-index values of 0.785, 0.715, 0.692 and 0.857, respectively, across 4 independent cohorts. A low TMPS was associated with a significantly increased survival rates, improved response to immunotherapy and reduced infiltration of immunosuppressive cells, such as. regulatory T cells. Finally, 8 potential sensitive drugs and 6 potential targets were predicted for patients based on their TMPS. The crosstalk between naïve CD4+ T cells and SPP1+ macrophages play a crucial role in the TME. TMPS can reflect this crosstalk and serve as a valuable tool for prognostic stratification and guiding clinical decision-making.","2024","International immunopharmacology"

Our aim was to investigate cardiac AREG expression, its potential as a postmortem hypothermia marker and its possible stress hormone dependency in different types of deaths. Heart RNA was isolated from hypothermic, cardiac and non-cardiac deaths. Relative AREG mRNA levels and urine stress hormone concentrations were measured by qPCR and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays from eight different death cause groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate a cut-off point for AREG expression as a hypothermia marker. Regulatory elements were predicted by PROMO. The AREG mRNA levels were significantly higher in hypothermic deaths than in most cardiac and non-cardiac deaths. AREG expression indicated hypothermic deaths with nearly 70% sensitivity and specificity. However, high expression levels were also detected in non-ischaemic deaths. The highest concentrations of adrenaline and cortisol were detected in hypothermic deaths, while the highest noradrenaline concentrations associated with atherosclerotic heart disease (AHD) deaths with acute myocardial infarction and trauma deaths. There were no significant correlations between stress hormones and AREG mRNA in hypothermic and non-cardiac deaths, whereas moderate-to-high associations were detected in cardiac deaths. Putative response elements for cortisol and catecholamines were found in AREG. Severe hypothermia activates cardiac AREG expression practicable as a postmortem hypothermia marker. Cortisol and catecholamines may act as transcriptional modifiers of this gene, especially in long-term ischaemic heart disease. However, the exact role of these hormones in upregulation of AREG during hypothermia remains unclear.","2024","Annals of medicine"
487,"39326470","The performance of prognostic models depended on the choice of missing value imputation algorithm: a simulation study.","The development of clinical prediction models is often impeded by the occurrence of missing values in the predictors. Various methods for imputing missing values before modeling have been proposed. Some of them are based on variants of multiple imputations by chained equations, while others are based on single imputation. These methods may include elements of flexible modeling or machine learning algorithms, and for some of them user-friendly software packages are available. The aim of this study was to investigate by simulation if some of these methods consistently outperform others in performance measures of clinical prediction models. We simulated development and validation cohorts by mimicking observed distributions of predictors and outcome variable of a real data set. In the development cohorts, missing predictor values were created in 36 scenarios defined by the missingness mechanism and proportion of noncomplete cases. We applied three imputation algorithms that were available in R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria): mice, aregImpute, and missForest. These algorithms differed in their use of linear or flexible models, or random forests, the way of sampling from the predictive posterior distribution, and the generation of a single or multiple imputed data set. For multiple imputation, we also investigated the impact of the number of imputations. Logistic regression models were fitted with the simulated development cohorts before (full data analysis) and after missing value generation (complete case analysis), and with the imputed data. Prognostic model performance was measured by the scaled Brier score, c-statistic, calibration intercept and slope, and by the mean absolute prediction error evaluated in validation cohorts without missing values. Performance of full data analysis was considered as ideal. None of the imputation methods achieved the model's predictive accuracy that would be obtained in case of no missingness. In general, complete case analysis yielded the worst performance, and deviation from ideal performance increased with increasing percentage of missingness and decreasing sample size. Across all scenarios and performance measures, aregImpute and mice, both with 100 imputations, resulted in highest predictive accuracy. Surprisingly, aregImpute outperformed full data analysis in achieving calibration slopes very close to one across all scenarios and outcome models. The increase of mice's performance with 100 compared to five imputations was only marginal. The differences between the imputation methods decreased with increasing sample sizes and decreasing proportion of noncomplete cases. In our simulation study, model calibration was more affected by the choice of the imputation method than model discrimination. While differences in model performance after using imputation methods were generally small, multiple imputation methods as mice and aregImpute that can handle linear or nonlinear associations between predictors and outcome are an attractive and reliable choice in most situations.","2024","Journal of clinical epidemiology"

However, systematic inflammatory response assessment models for predicting cancer immunotherapy (CIT) responses and survival across human cancers remain unexplored. Here, we investigated an inflammatory response score model to predict CIT responses and patient survival in a pan-cancer analysis. We retrieved 12 CIT response gene expression datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus database (GSE78220, GSE19423, GSE100797, GSE126044, GSE35640, GSE67501, GSE115821 and GSE168204), Tumor Immune Dysfunction and Exclusion database (PRJEB23709, PRJEB25780 and phs000452.v2.p1), European Genome-phenome Archive database (EGAD00001005738), and IMvigor210 cohort. The tumor samples from six cancers types: metastatic urothelial cancer, metastatic melanoma, gastric cancer, primary bladder cancer, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung cancer.We further established a binary classification model to predict CIT responses using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) computational algorithm. The model had high predictive accuracy in both the training and validation cohorts. During sub-group analysis, area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.82, 0.80, 0.71, 0.7, 0.67, and 0.64 were obtained for the non-small cell lung cancer, gastric cancer, metastatic urothelial cancer, primary bladder cancer, metastatic melanoma, and renal cell carcinoma cohorts, respectively. CIT response rates were higher in the high-scoring training cohort subjects (51%) than the low-scoring subjects (27%). The five-year survival rates in the high- and low score groups of the training cohorts were 62% and 21%, respectively, while those of the validation cohorts were 54% and 22%, respectively (P < 0·001 in all cases). Inflammatory response signature score derived from on-treatment tumor specimens are highly predictive of response to CIT in patients with metastatic melanoma. A significant correlation was observed between the inflammatory response scores and tumor purity. Regardless of the tumor purity, patients in the low score group had a significantly poorer prognosis than those in the high score group. Immune cell infiltration analysis indicated that in the high score cohort, tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes were significantly enriched, particularly effector and natural killer cells. Inflammatory response scores were positively correlated with immune checkpoint genes, suggesting that immune checkpoint inhibitors may have benefited patients with high scores. Analysis of signature scores across different cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas revealed that the prognostic performance of inflammatory response scores for survival in patients who have not undergone immunotherapy can be affected by tumor purity. Interleukin 21 (IL21) had the highest weight in the inflammatory response model, suggesting its vital role in the prediction mode. Since the number of metastatic melanoma patients (n = 429) was relatively large among CIT cohorts, we further performed a co-culture experiment using a melanoma cell line and CD8 + T cell populations generated from peripheral blood monocytes. The results showed that IL21 therapy combined with anti-PD1 (programmed cell death 1) antibodies (trepril monoclonal antibodies) significantly enhanced the cytotoxic activity of CD8 + T cells against the melanoma cell line. In this study, we developed an inflammatory response gene signature model that predicts patient survival and immunotherapy response in multiple malignancies. We further found that the predictive performance in the non-small cell lung cancer and gastric cancer group had the highest value among the six different malignancy subgroups. When compared with existing signatures, the inflammatory response gene signature scores for on-treatment samples were more robust predictors of the response to CIT in metastatic melanoma.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

By receiver operating characteristic analysis, a maximum oxygen saturation of less than 86% at any time point in the DR discriminated for BAS with a specificity of 0.88, sensitivity of 0.70, and area under the curve of 0.82. Intubation and lower oxygen saturation in the DR are independently associated with BAS in patients with TGA born at our center. A maximum DR saturation of less than 86% best discriminates patients who undergo BAS in our population.","2024","The Journal of pediatrics"

Patients with acute ischemic stroke who underwent brain DECT non-contrast scanning and brain CT perfusion (CTP) before thrombectomy were included, and the thrombus composition was analyzed by postoperative pathology. DECT data was conducted to reconstruct polychromatic images and effective atomic number images. Computed tomography (CT) values, effective atomic numbers, and spectral curve slopes of the thrombus were measured and calculated. Thrombus attenuation increase was obtained from CTP data. Parameters were compared between red blood cell (RBC)-dominant thrombi and fibrin/platelet (F/P)-dominant thrombi. Thresholds, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were analyzed to distinguish these thrombi. The associations between DECT parameters and proportion of RBCs were analyzed by Spearman's correlation. Pathological analysis of 42 enrolled patients revealed 24 cases of RBC-dominant thrombi and 18 cases of F/P-dominant thrombi. Effective atomic numbers, spectral curve slopes, and polychromatic images CT values were significantly higher in the RBC-dominant thrombi group compared with the F/P-dominant thrombi group. Although the average thrombus attenuation increase was greater in the F/P-dominant thrombi group, this difference was not statistically significant. Among the DECT parameters, polychromatic images CT values had the greatest AUC at 0.924 (0.848-0.999) for discriminating RBC-dominant and F/P-dominant thrombi, with a threshold of 59 HU, sensitivity of 79.2 %, and specificity of 94.4 %. The combined diagnostic AUC reached 0.938 (0.863-1.012), with 87.5 % sensitivity and 94.4 % specificity. DECT polychromatic images CT values, effective atomic numbers, and spectral curve slopes were significantly correlated with proportion of RBCs (r = 0.673, 0.574, and 0.571, all p < 0.01). DECT non-contrast scan parameters are associated with thrombus composition, which could be effective in distinguishing between RBC-dominant and F/P-dominant thrombi.","2024","European journal of radiology"

However, oculo-gait patterns and their correlation with cognition in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD) remain unclear. Patients with CSVD from a hospital-based cohort (n = 194) and individuals with presumed early CSVD from a community-based cohort (n = 319) were included. Oculo-gait patterns were measured using the artificial intelligence (AI) -assisted 'EyeKnow' eye-tracking and 'ReadyGo' motor evaluation systems. Multivariable linear and logistic regression models were employed to investigate the association between the oculo-gait parameters and cognition. Anti-saccade accuracy, stride velocity, and swing velocity were significantly associated with cognition in both patients and community dwellers with CSVD, and could identify cognitive impairment in CSVD with moderate accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]: hospital cohort, 0.787; community cohort, 0.810) after adjusting for age and education. The evaluation of oculo-gait features (anti-saccade accuracy, stride velocity, and swing velocity) may help screen cognitive impairment in CSVD. Oculo-gait features (lower anti-saccade accuracy, stride velocity, and swing velocity) were associated with cognitive impairment in cerebral small vessel disease (CSVD). Logistic model integrating the oculo-gait features, age, and education level moderately distinguished cognitive status in CSVD.

We aimed to develop prediction models that, using characteristics available at diabetes diagnosis, can identify youth who will retain endogenous insulin secretion at levels consistent with type 2 diabetes (T2D). We studied 2,966 youth with diabetes in the prospective SEARCH for Diabetes in Youth study (diagnosis age ≤19 years) to develop prediction models to identify participants with fasting C-peptide ≥250 pmol/L (≥0.75 ng/mL) after >3 years' (median 74 months) diabetes duration. Models included clinical measures at the baseline visit, at a mean diabetes duration of 11 months (age, BMI, sex, waist circumference, HDL cholesterol), with and without islet autoantibodies (GADA, IA-2A) and a type 1 diabetes genetic risk score (T1DGRS). Models using routine clinical measures with or without autoantibodies and T1DGRS were highly accurate in identifying participants with C-peptide ≥0.75 ng/mL (17% of participants; 2.3% and 53% of those with and without positive autoantibodies) (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUCROC] 0.95-0.98).

We conducted a retrospective study of 217 thyroid nodules. Lesions were divided into training (n = 152) and verification (n = 65) cohorts. Three radiomics scores were derived from B-mode ultrasound (B-US) and strain elastography (SE) images, alone and in combination. A radiomics nomogram was constructed by combining high-frequency ultrasonic features and the best-performing radiomics score. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), unnecessary FNA rate, and decision curve analysis (DCA) results for the nomogram were compared to those obtained with the American College of Radiology Thyroid Imaging, Reporting and Data System (ACR TI-RADS) score and the combined TI-RADS+SE+ contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) advanced clinical score. The three radiomics scores (B-US, SE, B-US+SE) achieved training AUCs of 0.753 (0.668-0.825), 0.761 (0.674-0.838), and 0.795 (0.715-0.871), and validation AUCs of 0.732 (0.579-0.867), 0.753 (0.609-0.892), and 0.752 (0.592-0.899) respectively. The AUC of the nomogram for the entire patient cohort was 0.909 (0.864-0.954), which was higher than that of the ACR TI-RADS score (P < 0.001) and equivalent to the TI-RADS+SE+CEUS score (P = 0.753). Similarly, the unnecessary FNA rate of the radiomics nomogram was significantly lower than that of the ACR TI-RADS score (P = 0.007) and equivalent to the TI-RADS+SE+CEUS score (P = 0.457). DCA also showed that the radiomics nomogram brought more net clinical benefit than the ACR TI-RADS score but was similar to that of the TI-RADS+SE+CEUS score. The radiomics nomogram developed in this study can be used as an objective, accurate, cost-effective, and noninvasive method for the characterization of thyroid nodules.","2024","Academic radiology"

However, the correlation between LET and the therapeutic efficacy in Carbon-ion radiotherapy (CIRT) for locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (LA-NSCLC) is currently not clear. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between the dose-averaged LET (LETd) distribution within tumor and local recurrence for LA-NSCLC treated with CIRT. An analysis of 62 consecutive patients with LA-NSCLC who underwent CIRT from 2018 to 2022 was conducted. The LETd distribution was calculated based on their treated plans, and the correlation between local recurrence and LETd, relative biological effectiveness (RBE)-weighted doses (DRBE) and clinical factors was investigated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, log-rank test, and Cox regression analysis were performed based on that. 16 patients were defined as local recurrence. Overall survival (OS) and local control (LC) at 24 months were 76.9 % and 73.2 %, respectively. The mean LETd in internal gross tumor volume (iGTV) in the local recurrence group was 48.7 keV/µm, significantly lower than the mean LETd of 53.2 keV/µm in the local control group (p = 0.016). No significant difference was observed in DRBE between the local recurrence and local control groups. ROC curve analysis indicated that a percentage of 88 % of volume in iGTV receiving at least 40 keV/µm (V40keV/μm) is the optimal threshold for predicting local recurrence (Area under curve (AUC) = 0.7636). The log-rank test and Cox regression analysis revealed that the LETd value covering 98 % volume of iGTV (LETd98%) was a significant risk factor for LC (p = 0.020). Our study revealed an association between LETd distribution and local recurrence in patients with LA-NSCLC. These findings suggest that lower LETd may increase the probability of local recurrence. We suggest that LETd distribution within iGTV should be routinely assessed in CIRT for lung cancer.","2024","Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology"

Although artificial intelligence (AI) has shown promise in cancer prediction, applications specifically targeting SCC are limited. To design and validate a deep learning model tailored to predict metastatic SCC in radical lymph node dissection specimens using whole slide images (WSIs). Using the EfficientNetB1 architecture, a model was trained on 6587 WSIs (2413 SCC and 4174 nonneoplastic) from several hospitals, encompassing esophagus, head and neck, lung, and skin specimens. The training exclusively relied on WSI-level labels without annotations. We evaluated the model on a test set consisting of 541 WSIs (41 SCC and 500 nonneoplastic) of radical lymph node dissection specimens. The model exhibited high performance, with receiver operating characteristic curve areas under the curve between 0.880 and 0.987 in detecting SCC metastases in lymph nodes. Although true positives and negatives were accurately identified, certain limitations were observed. These included false positives due to germinal centers, dust cell aggregations, and specimen-handling artifacts, as well as false negatives due to poor differentiation. The developed artificial intelligence model presents significant potential in enhancing SCC lymph node detection, offering workload reduction for pathologists and increasing diagnostic efficiency. Continuous refinement is needed to overcome existing challenges, making the model more robust and clinically relevant.","2024","Archives of pathology & laboratory medicine"

Patients underwent transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), phase-contrast MR (PMRI), 4DF-MR and 6-minute walk test (6MWT) at baseline, and a follow-up PMRI and 6MWT at 6 months. MR-Rvol was quantified by PMRI, 4DF-MR, and TTE by one observer. The pre-operative MR-Rvol was correlated with the post-operative decrease in the LV end-diastolic volume index (LVEDVi). Included Student t-test/Mann-Whitney test/Fisher's exact test, Bland-Altman plots, linear regression analysis and receiver operating characteristic curves. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. While Bland-Altman plots demonstrated similar bias between all the modalities, the limits of agreement were narrower between 4DF-MR and PMRI (bias 15; limits of agreement -36 mL to 65 mL), than between 4DF-MR and TTE (bias -8; limits of agreement -106 mL to 90 mL) and PMRI and TTE (bias -23; limits of agreement -105 mL to 59 mL). Linear regression analysis demonstrated a significant association between the MR-Rvol and the post-operative decrease in the LVEDVi, when the MR-Rvol was quantified by PMRI and 4DF-MR, but not by TTE (P = 0.73). 4DF-MR demonstrated the best diagnostic performance for reduction in the post-operative LVEDVi with the largest area under the curve (4DF-MR 0.83; vs. PMRI 0.78; and TTE 0.51; P = 0.89).

Patients diagnosed with RCC between 2010 and 2021 from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database were selected. The eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Random Forest (RF) machine learning algorithms were used to screen for the most influential factors affecting prognosis, and the Venn diagram method was employed for further refinement. Subsequently, a nomogram related to brain metastases was constructed. The performance of the nomograms was evaluated through receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, calibration plots, C-index, time-dependent C-index, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves were used to provide additional verification of the clinical efficacy of the nomogram. This research comprised 2,395 RCC patients with LM. The Venn diagram demonstrated that age, histological type, grade, AJCC T stage, AJCC N stage, surgery, chemotherapy, marital status, and lung metastasis were highly relevant variables to patients with LM. The AUC, C-index, calibration curves, and DCA curves showed excellent performance of the nomogram. Additionally, the prognostic nomogram accurately classified RCC with LM patients into low- and high-risk groups for mortality. This study developed a novel nomogram to predict the prognostic factors of RCC with LM, providing a valuable reference for making accurate clinical decisions.","2024","Frontiers in medicine"

Clinical algorithms have reduced CCT scans and hospitalisations by 10%. We aimed to established age-appropriate reference values for GFAP and UCH-L1 and evaluate their diagnostic test performance in identifying ciTBI in children. This study was a diagnostic test accuracy substudy within the PROS100B stepped wedge cluster randomised trial that included children aged 16 years or younger, clinically managed within 3 h of mTBI, with a GCS score of 15 requiring hospitalisation or CCT scan according to French Pediatric Society guidelines (equivalent to the intermediate risk group of the PECARN algorithm). Enrolment for PROS100B occurred from Nov 1, 2016, to Oct 31, 2021, at 11 hospital emergency departments in France. Stored blood samples collected from March 1, 2015, to Oct 31, 2015, from children aged 16 years or younger who were outpatients for allergic conditions unrelated to mTBI and free of neurological disease were used as a control group to calculate reference values of GFAP and UCH-L1 across four age groups (<6 months, 6 months to <2 years, 2 years to <4 years, and 4 years to <16 years). The diagnostic test performance of GFAP and UCH-L1, both above the reference range to identify ciTBI, was evaluated in the children with mTBI. GFAP and UCH-L1 were measured with the Alinity analyser (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA). Reference values were calculated from GFAP and UCH-L1 measured in samples from 718 control children (378 [53%] boys and 340 [47%] girls). 531 children (334 [63%] boys and 197 [37%] girls) aged 0-16 years with mTBI were included. By applying our reference values for GFAP and UCH-L1 across four age groups the biomarker combination (both biomarkers above reference ranges) had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 69-100), a negative predictive value of 100% (99-100), a specificity of 67% (63-71), a positive likelihood ratio of 3·01 (2·67-3·40), a negative likelihood ratio of 0, and an area under the curve of 0·83 (0·81-0·85) in identifying ciTBI.

Currently, various commercial systems offer built-in alert algorithms to identify cows requiring attention. To our knowledge, no work has been done to compare the use of models accounting for herd-level variability on their predictive ability against automated systems. Long short-term memory (LSTM) models are machine learning models capable of learning temporal patterns and making predictions based on time series data. The objective of our study was to evaluate the ability of LSTM models to identify a health alert associated with a ketosis diagnosis (HAK) using deviations of daily milk yield, milk fat-to-protein ratio (FPR), number of successful milkings, rumination time, and activity index from the herd median by parity and DIM, considering various time series lengths and numbers of days before HAK. Additionally, we aimed to use Explainable Artificial Intelligence method to understand the relationships between input variables and model outputs. Data on daily milk yield, milk FPR, number of successful milkings, rumination time, activity, and health events during 0 to 21 DIM were retrospectively obtained from a commercial Holstein dairy farm in northern Indiana from February 2020 to January 2023. A total of 1,743 cows were included in the analysis (non-HAK = 1,550; HAK = 193). Variables were transformed based on deviations from the herd median by parity and DIM. Six LSTM models were developed to identify HAK 1, 2, and 3 d before farm diagnosis using historic cow-level data with varying time series lengths. Model performance was assessed using repeated stratified 10-fold cross-validation for 20 repeats. The Shapley additive explanations framework (SHAP) was used for model explanation. Model accuracy was 83%, 74%, and 70%; balanced error rate was 17% to 18%, 26% to 28%, and 34%; sensitivity was 81% to 83%, 71% to 74%, and 62%; specificity was 83%, 74%, and 71%; positive predictive value was 38%, 25% to 27%, and 21%; negative predictive value was 97% to 98%, 95% to 96%, and 94%; and area under the curve was 0.89 to 0.90, 0.80 to 0.81, and 0.72 for models identifying HAK 1, 2, and 3 d before diagnosis, respectively. Performance declined as the time interval between identification and farm diagnosis increased, and extending the time series length did not improve model performance. Model explanation revealed that cows with lower milk yield, number of successful milkings, rumination time, and activity, and higher milk FPR compared with herdmates of the same parity and DIM were more likely to be classified as HAK. Our results demonstrate the potential of LSTM models in identifying HAK using deviations of daily milk production variables, rumination time, and activity index from the herd median by parity and DIM. Future studies are needed to evaluate the performance of health alerts using LSTM models controlling for herd-specific metrics against commercial built-in algorithms in multiple farms and for other disorders.","2024","Journal of dairy science"

In this study, we optimized the formulation parameters of FS60-curcuminoid aggregates (FC) and studied their effects on Cur pharmacokinetics in rats. Results showed that the optimized aggregates had an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 88.22 % and hydrodynamic diameter (DH) of 231.48 nm. Additionally, administering FC significantly increased curcumin glucuronide (Cur-O-Glu) levels. The Cmax was 51 times higher and AUC0-12h was 19 times higher than curcuminoid alone. Moreover, FS60 intervention for seven days increased the absorption speed of Cur-O-Glu into the bloodstream. Further mechanistic studies indicated that FS60 promoted Cur ingestion, increased UGT expression, and inhibited enterocyte transporters, allowing large amounts of Cur-O-Glu to enter the bloodstream. Moreover, the gut microbiota modulated by FS60 accelerated the mutual conversion of pentose and gluconate to provide sufficient glucuronic acid for the glucuronidation of Cur in enterocytes. Consequently, the nano delivery system composed by FS60 and curcuminoid facilitated gastrointestinal Cur glucuronidation and Cur-O-Glu absorption.","2025","International journal of biological macromolecules"

The combined model achieved a concordance index of 0.789 (95 % confidence interval [CI] 0.787-0.791), 0.768 (95 % CI 0.764-0.771), and 0.804 (95 % CI 0.801-0.807) for the training, internal validation, and external test cohorts, respectively, demonstrating a statistically significant improvement compared to the MRI model, T Stage, and N Stage. An overall score of < 0.405 in patients was significantly associated with a low risk of progression. In the low-risk group, patients treated with IMRT alone had comparable or even superior progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those who received additional chemotherapy. The model demonstrated a satisfactory prognostic and predictive performance for PFS. Patients with stage II NPC were stratified into different risk groups to help identify optimal candidates who could benefit from IMRT alone.","2025","Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology"

This study aims to develop a concise risk score model for this purpose, enhancing the predictability and management of AP in ICU settings. We included 380 patients in our training set. Twenty-seven variables were retrospectively collected, and predictive variables were selected using LASSO penalized regression and refined through backward elimination multivariate models. Effect sizes were used to create the final model to predict 7 and 30-day mortality among AP patients admitted to the ICU. Of 380 patients, the mortality rate was 23.2 %. The final model included five predictors: INR, Albumin, Lactic Acid, BUN, and Bilirubin. The 5-fold cross-validated mean AUC was 0.93 (SD: 0.048) for 7-day mortality and 0.84 (SD: 0.033) for 30-day mortality, with a sensitivity of 77 % and specificity of 74 %. The risk score outperformed BISAP (AUC: 0.60) and APACHE-II (AUC: 0.76) in predicting mortality.

However, preoperative imaging is not reliable enough for identifying LNM. To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram based on dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MR images for identifying LNM and prognosis in iCCA. Retrospective. Two hundred four patients with pathologically proven iCCA who underwent curative-intent resection and lymphadenectomy (training cohort: N = 107, internal test cohort: N = 46, and external test cohort: N = 51). T1- and T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and DCE imaging at 1.5 T or 3.0 T. Radiomics features were extracted from intra- and peri-tumoral regions on preoperative DCE-MR images. Imaging features were evaluated by three radiologists, and significant variables in univariable and multivariable regression analysis were included in clinical model. The best-performing radiomics signature and clinical characteristics (intrahepatic duct dilatation, MRI-reported LNM) were combined to build a nomogram. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their nomogram scores (cutoff = 0.341). Patients were followed up for 1-102 months (median 12) after surgery, the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration, decision curve, Delong test, Kaplan-Meier curves, log rank test. Two tailed P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. The nomogram incorporating intra- and peri-tumoral radiomics features, intrahepatic duct dilatation and MRI-reported LNM obtained the best discrimination for LNM, with areas under the ROC curves of 0.946, 0.913, and 0.859 in the training, internal, and external test cohorts. In the entire cohort, high-risk patients had significantly lower RFS and OS than low-risk patients. High-risk of LNM was an independent factor of unfavorable OS and RFS.

Adolescence is also a time of social reorientation, where decisions not only involve weighing immediate against future outcomes, but also consequences for self versus those for others. In this functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging study, we examined the neural correlates of immediate and delayed reward choices where the delayed outcomes could benefit self, friends, or unknown others. A total of 196 adolescent twins aged 14-17 completed a social delay discounting task, with fMRI data acquired from 174 participants. Out of these, 156 adolescents had valid fMRI data, and 138 adolescents had observations in every condition. Adolescents more often chose the immediate reward when it was larger, and when the delay was longer. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) comparisons revealed that behavior differed across delay-beneficiaries, with AUC being highest for the self, followed by friends, and lowest for unknown others. This suggests that adolescents are more willing to wait for rewards for self. Neuroimaging analyses showed increased activity in the midline areas medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and precuneus, as well as bilateral temporal parietal junction (TPJ) when considering delayed reward for unknown others and friends compared to self. A whole-brain interaction with choice showed that the bilateral insula and right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) were more active for delayed choices for unknown others and for immediate choices for friends and self. This underscores that the neuro-cognitive processing of how delays reduce the value of rewards depends on closeness of the beneficiary.","2024","Developmental cognitive neuroscience"

The study patients (n = 719) were divided into internal training, internal validation, and external validation cohorts; all had small SPNs and had undergone preoperative chest CTs and surgical resection. We developed five DL models incorporating features of the nodule and five different peri-nodular regions with the Multiscale Dual Attention Network (MDANet) to differentiate benign and malignant SPNs. We selected the best-performing model, which was then compared to four conventional algorithms (VGG19, ResNet50, ResNeXt50, and DenseNet121). Furthermore, another five DL models were constructed using MDANet to distinguish benign tumors from inflammatory nodules and the one performed best was selected out. Model 4, which incorporated the nodule and 15 mm peri-nodular region, best differentiated benign and malignant SPNs. The model had an area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, recall, precision, and F1-score of 0.730, 0.724, 0.711, 0.705, and 0.707 in the external validation cohort.

Studies on changes in PEF rates in patients with stroke often have small sample sizes, limiting the generalizability of their findings. This study aimed to compare the PEF rates between patients who were post-stroke with or without pneumonia and age- and sex-matched healthy controls and explore the PEF-pneumonia association among stroke survivors. Prospective observational study. Department of Rehabilitation, the First Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou Medical University. Initially, 809 patients with stroke undergoing inpatient rehabilitation were recruited. Data collected included the demographics, stroke history, the presence of dysphagia, and the PEF rates on admission. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the PEF threshold as predictive of pneumonia after adjusting for confounders. Patients with stroke had a mean PEF rate of 243.89±139.38 L/min, significantly lower than that of the normal control group. The PEF rate was significantly lower in the pneumonia group than in the non-pneumonia group (P<0.001). Within the stroke cohort, the PEF rates were lower than the predicted rates (P<0.001). Older age, lower PEF(%),and dysphagia were associated with a higher pneumonia risk post-stroke per stepwise multivariate logistic regression analysis. Furthermore, the combination of these three significant predictors (PEF(%), swallowing function, and age) yielded an area under the curve of 0.857 .Regarding age, the cut-off point of ≥65.5 years was the optimal level to discriminate the presence of pneumonia among patients with stroke. For PEF%,the cut-off point of <60% was the optimal level to discriminate the presence of pneumonia among patients with stroke. For screening dysphagia, the patients with impaired safety only and those with impaired safety and efficacy faced a higher pneumonia risk. Patients with stroke exhibited significantly lower peak expiratory flow rates compared to healthy controls after adjusting for age and sex and when compared to their reference values. Decreased PEF rates were independently associated with pneumonia development during inpatient rehabilitation in post-stroke patients. This study suggests that low PEF rates may predict pneumonia and that the prevention of PEF rate decline may prevent pneumonia development.","2024","European journal of physical and rehabilitation medicine"

Across 24 Italian sites, 707 healthy individuals (50-89 years, men: 268, women: 439) with diverse educational levels (3-24 years) were recruited. Subjects met criteria for normal conditions investigated through a semi-structured interview covering neurological, psychiatric, general medical, and psychopharmacological history. Two test versions were created to assess test-retest reliability at 45-day intervals. We also enrolled 187 subjects with Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI) and 181 with Alzheimer's Disease (AD) for validation. The raw scores obtained on both versions of Itel-MMSE were set as dependent variables in linear regression models that included age, education, and gender as independent variables. RESULTS : Mean raw Itel-MMSE1 score was 20.82 (range: 13-22). Multiple linear regression demonstrated significant effects of sociodemographic variables for age and education, establishing a new cut-off ≥ 18.49. Mean raw Itel-MMSE2 score was 20.97 (range: 10-22), with a new cut-off ≥ 18.45.

Consequently, pinpointing factors predictive of treatment responsiveness is of paramount importance. Gene expression and regulation, inherently operating within intricate networks, constitute fundamental molecular machinery for cellular processes and often serve as robust biomarkers. Nevertheless, contemporary feature selection approaches grapple with two key challenges: opacity in modeling and scarcity in accounting for gene-gene interactions METHODS: To address these limitations, we devise a novel feature selection methodology grounded in cooperative game theory, harmoniously integrating with sophisticated machine learning models. This approach identifies interconnected gene regulatory network biomarker modules with priori genetic linkage architecture. Specifically, we leverage Shapley values on network to quantify feature importance, while strategically constraining their integration based on network expansion principles and nodal adjacency, thereby fostering enhanced interpretability in feature selection. We apply our methods to a publicly available single-cell RNA sequencing dataset of breast cancer immunotherapy responses, using the identified feature gene set as biomarkers. Functional enrichment analysis with independent validations further illustrates their effective predictive performance RESULTS: We demonstrate the sophistication and excellence of the proposed method in data with network structure. It unveiled a cohesive biomarker module encompassing 27 genes for immunotherapy response. Notably, this module proves adept at precisely predicting anti-PD1 therapeutic outcomes in breast cancer patients with classification accuracy of 0.905 and AUC value of 0.971, underscoring its unique capacity to illuminate gene functionalities CONCLUSION: The proposed method is effective for identifying network module biomarkers, and the detected anti-PD1 response biomarkers can enrich our understanding of the underlying physiological mechanisms of immunotherapy, which have a promising application for realizing precision medicine.","2024","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

We aimed to explore the discriminative ability of Aβ PET features and whether combining Aβ PET and structural MRI features can improve the classification performance of the machine learning model in older healthy control (OHC) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from AD. We collected 94 AD patients, 82 MCI patients, and 85 OHC from three different cohorts. 17 global/regional Aβ features in Centiloid, 122 regional volume, and 68 regional cortical thickness were extracted as imaging features. Single or combined modality features were used to train the random forest model on the testing set. The top 10 features were sorted based on the Gini index in each binary classification. The results showed that AUC scores were 0.81/0.86 and 0.69/0.68 using sMRI/Aβ PET features on the testing set in differentiating OHC and MCI from AD. The performance was improved while combining two-modality features with an AUC of 0.89 and an AUC of 0.71 in two classifications.

Surgery after neoadjuvant treatment (NAT) is indicated in the absence of progression, knowing the limits in accurately predicting resectability with traditional radiology. R Status being a pathological parameter, it can be assessed only after surgery. Patients successfully resected for histologically confirmed PDAC after NAT for BR and LA disease were included, with attention to the predictors of R status from the existing literature. The Bayesian logistic regression model was estimated for predicting the R1 status. The area under curve (AUC) of the average posterior probability of R1 was calculated and results were reported considering the 95% posterior credible intervals for the odds ratios, along with the probability of direction. The final model demonstrated a commendable AUC value of 0.72, indicating good performance. The likelihood of positive margins was associated with older age, higher ASA score, the presence of venous and/or arterial involvement at preoperative radiology, tumor location within the pancreatic body, a lack of tumor size reduction post-NAT, and the persistence of an elevated Ca19.9 value.

In this study, we sought to assess multiple relevant components of the complement cascade to determine if they are altered in SSc-PAH, as well as their potential utility as biomarkers of disease severity and progression. Complement components (n = 14) were measured using multiplex assays in 156 patients with SSc-PAH from a multi-site repository and were compared to 33 patients with SSc without PAH, and 40 healthy controls. Data were evaluated for correlations between complement levels, right heart catheterization measures, and clinical endpoints including 6-minute walk distance. To assess complement longitudinally, serum complement levels were assayed at 0, 4, 12, 24, 36 and 48 weeks in 52 SSc-PAH patients who participated in a prior clinical trial. We found that factor D was significantly elevated in SSc-PAH compared to SSc without PAH (p < 0.0001) and was highly sensitive and specific for SSc-PAH (AUC=0.82, p < 0.001). In SSc-PAH patients, alterations in factor H, C4, and factor D were associated with measures of PAH disease severity including right heart catheterization measurements (cardiac output, right atrial pressure, and VO2 max), survival, and 6-minute walk distance. No significant changes in complement levels or clinical associations were seen over time or associated with treatment in the longitudinal clinical trial study. Our work confirms prior studies demonstrating a role for complement activation in SSc vascular disease and elevations of factor D in a large SSc-PAH population. Further, factor H and other complement factors are associated with severity of PAH including mortality. Taken together, these findings suggest that the alternative complement pathway plays a role in SSc-PAH pathogenesis and may serve as a biomarker to inform diagnosis and prognosis.","2024","Seminars in arthritis and rheumatism"

Forty-four patients [11 men (25%); mean age 62.6 ± 14.7 years] with PSAT ablation in 4 tertiary medical centers were assigned to 3 groups according to the ablation site: right atrial (RA) para-Hisian region (group 1, n = 10), noncoronary cusp (NCC) (group 2, n = 13), and left atrial (LA) paraseptal area (group 3, n = 21). Multiple-chamber activation mapping was performed guided by a 3-dimensional navigation system. The discrepancies in the earliest activation time between 2 of 3 chambers (ΔRA-LA, ΔRA-NCC, and ΔLA-NCC) were calculated in each group and used for pairwise comparisons. There was a significant difference in ΔRA-LA, ΔRA-NCC, and ΔLA-NCC among the 3 groups.

The conventional diagnosis of OSA relies on polysomnography, which involves multiple electrodes and expert supervision. A promising alternative is single-channel Electrocardiogram (ECG) based diagnosis due to its simplicity and relevance. However, extracting respiratory-related features from ECG is challenging since ECG signals do not directly reflect respiratory patterns. Consequently, the accuracy of most deep learning models that predict OSA using ECG data remains to be improved. In this study, we propose the Time-Hybrid OSA transformer (THO), a novel method that leverages single-lead ECG signals for accurate OSA detection. The THO enhances feature extraction using a hybrid architecture combining dilated convolution and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), along with a multi-scale feature fusion strategy. Additionally, THO integrates an embedded memory decay mechanism within a multi-head attention model to capture real-time characteristics of time series data. Finally, a voting mechanism is incorporated to enhance decision reliability. Evaluation of the THO model demonstrates superior performance with prediction accuracy (ACC) and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values of 95.03 % and 96.85 %, respectively, representing improvements of 11 % and 8 % over comparative models. Moreover, the ACC shows a 5 % enhancement relative to state-of-the-art models.

As an alternative to the conventional plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT) based on sera, we tested the utility of liver homogenates from experimentally infected (YFV, Mayaro virus [MAYV], chikungunya virus [CHIKV], or mock) mice to quantify PRNTs. Although homogenates from mock-infected mice showed a low level of nonspecific virus neutralization against all three viruses, homogenates from YFV-, MAYV- and CHIKV-infected mice demonstrated significantly higher levels of virus neutralization compared to controls. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves analyses were performed using the median neutralization values of three technical replicates for each infected group separately or collectively. Results showed scores ≥0.97 (95% CI ≥ 0.89-1.0) for the area under the curve at dilutions 1:20 to 1:80, suggesting that median virus neutralization values effectively differentiated infected mice from controls. Liver homogenates obtained from 25 NHP carcasses (collected during the 2017 YF outbreak in Brazil) were also tested using the adapted PRNT as well as rapid lateral flow tests to investigate anti-YFV IgM. Neutralization activity was detected in six NHP samples that were also positive by PCR and anti-YFV IgM tests and one sample that tested negative by PCR and IgM test.

A higher preoperative RCA Index was significantly associated with recurrence (0.215 [0.031] in the recurrent group vs 0.125 [0.034] in the nonrecurrent group, P < .001). The preoperative RCA Index highly correlated with the postoperative RCA Index (Pearson's correlation: 0.918, P < .001), and there was only a small (average: 0.005) but significant increase in the RCA Index of the unaffected hemisphere after surgery ( P = .01).The preoperative RCA Index positively correlated with age, preoperative SDH thickness and volume, and recurrence. A RCA Index cutoff value of 0.165 predicted CSDH recurrence with high sensitivity (95.6%) and specificity (93.3%) (area under the curve = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.93-1). The RCA Index is a simple yet robust predictor of CSDH recurrence. Incorporating this measure into the preoperative assessment may enhance surgical planning and postoperative management, potentially reducing recurrence rates.","2024","Neurosurgery"

Additionally, it investigates the nomogram's contribution to the revised Framingham Stroke Risk Profile (rFSRP) for predicting cerebro-cardiovascular risk. Predictive models aimed at identifying an increased risk of future cerebro-cardiovascular events were developed and internally validated at one center, then externally validated at two other centers. Survival curves, constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method, were compared through the log-rank test. This study included a total of 2009 patients (3946 images). The final nomogram was generated using multivariate Cox regression variables, including dyslipidemia, lumen diameter, plaque echogenicity, and ultrasonography (US)-based radiomics risk. The Harrell's concordance index (C-index) for predicting events-free survival (EFS) was 0.708 in the training cohort, 0.574 in the external validation cohort 1, 0.632 in the internal validation cohort, and 0.639 in the external validation cohort 2. The final nomogram showed a significant increase in C-index compared to the clinical, conventional US, and US-based radiomics models (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, the final nomogram-assisted method significantly improved the sensitivity and accuracy of radiologists' visual qualitative score of plaque (both P < 0.001). Among 1058 patients with corresponding 1588 plaque US images classified as low-risk by the rFSRP, 75 (7.1%) patients with corresponding 93 (5.9%) carotid plaque images were appropriately reclassified to the high-risk category by the final nomogram. The radiomics-based nomogram demonstrated accurate prediction of cerebro-cardiovascular events in patients with asymptomatic carotid plaques. It also improved the sensitivity and accuracy of radiologists' visual qualitative score of carotid plaque and enhanced the risk stratification ability of rFSRP. The radiomics-based nomogram allowed accurate prediction of cerebro-cardiovascular events, especially ipsilateral ischemic stroke in patients with asymptomatic carotid atherosclerotic plaques.

A total of 386 AIS patients were divided into the PSCI group (174 cases) and the cognitively normal (CN) group (212 cases) based on the occurrence of PSCI. These patients were further categorized into two cohorts: 270 AIS patients in the training set, 116 AIS patients in the validation set. Multifactor logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent predictors, which were then included in the prediction model for further analysis and validation. The performance of the prediction model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), calibration plots analyses to assess discrimination, calibration ability, respectively. Based on the selected variables (smoking, alcohol consumption, female gender, low education level, NIHSS score at admission, stroke progression, high systolic blood pressure, diabetes, atrial fibrillation, coronary heart disease, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, β2-microglobulin, and Lp-PLA2), a clinical prediction model for the occurrence of PSCI within 6 months in AIS patients was constructed. The AUC-ROC of the model was 0.862, 0.806 in the training, validation sets, respectively. Calibration curve analyses and Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit tests, along with other validation metrics, further demonstrated the model's good predictive performance. The model exhibits high discriminative ability for PSCI and has substantial guiding value for clinical decision-making.

This study aimed to develop a reliable model to predict HE in ACLF patients during hospitalization. Retrospectively recruiting 255 hepatitis B-related ACLF patients, including 67 who developed HE during hospitalization, the study analysed clinical data and biochemical indices collected during the first week of admission. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was used to identify characteristic predictors for hospitalization HE events, and a logistic regression model was subsequently developed. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and bootstrap resampling were used to evaluate the model's discrimination, consistency, and accuracy, and a nomogram was created to visualize the model. An external validation cohort of 236 liver failure patients collected from the same medical centre between 2007 and 2010 was used to validate the model. The study found that blood urea nitrogen (BUN), alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), international normalized ratio (INR), serum ammonia, and infection complications during hospitalization were risk factors for HE in ACLF patients. The new model predicted the development of HE in ACLF patients with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 85.2%, which was superior to other models. The best threshold for the new model was 0.28, resulting in a specificity of 81.4% and a sensitivity of 80.6%. In the validation group, the new model showed similar results, with an AUROC of 79% and a specificity of 83.6% and a sensitivity of 56.6%. This study developed and validated a new prediction model for HE in ACLF patients offering a useful tool for early identification of patients with a high risk of HE in clinical settings. However, to ascertain the model's general effectiveness, future prospective multicentre studies are warranted.","2024","Annals of medicine"

A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.","Identifying a microorganism in patients with native vertebral osteomyelitis presents diagnostic challenges. Microorganism identification through culture-based methods is constrained by prolonged processing times and sensitivity limitations. Despite the availability of molecular diagnostic techniques for identifying microorganisms in native vertebral osteomyelitis, there is considerable variability in reported sensitivity and specificity across studies, leading to uncertainty in their clinical utility. What are the sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratios for 16S broad-range PCR followed by Sanger sequencing (16S) and metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) for detecting bacteria in native vertebral osteomyelitis? On June 29, 2023, we searched Cochrane, Embase, Medline, and Scopus for results from January 1970 to June 2023. Included studies involved adult patients with suspected native vertebral osteomyelitis undergoing molecular diagnostics-16S bacterial broad-range PCR followed by Sanger sequencing and shotgun or targeted metagenomic NGS-for bacteria detection. Studies involving nonnative vertebral osteomyelitis and cases of brucellar, tubercular, or fungal etiology were excluded. The reference standard for the diagnosis of native vertebral osteomyelitis was a composite clinical- and investigator-defined native vertebral osteomyelitis diagnosis. Diagnostic performance was assessed using a bivariate random-effects model. Risk of bias and diagnostic applicability were evaluated using the revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) tool. After a manual screening of 3403 studies, 10 studies (5 on 16S, 5 on NGS) were included in the present analysis, from which 391 patients were included from a total of 958 patients overall. Quality assessment via QUADAS-2 criteria showed moderate risk of bias and good applicability. 16S showed 78% (95% confidence interval [CI] 95% CI 31% to 96%) sensitivity and 94% (95% CI 73% to 99%) specificity, whereas NGS demonstrated 82% (95% CI 63% to 93%) sensitivity and 71% (95% CI 37% to 91%) specificity. In addition, the diagnostic ORs were 59 (95% CI 9 to 388) and 11 (95% CI 4 to 35) for 16S and NGS, respectively. Summary receiver operating characteristic curves showed high test performance for 16S (area under the curve for 16S 95% [95% CI 93% to 97%] and for NGS 89% [95% CI 86% to 92%]). Certainty in estimates was moderate because of sample size limitations. This meta-analysis found moderate-to-high diagnostic performance of molecular methods on direct patient specimens for the diagnosis of native vertebral osteomyelitis. When used as a complementary test to microbiological analyses, a positive 16S result rules in the diagnosis of native vertebral osteomyelitis, while further studies are needed to understand the role of NGS in the diagnosis of native vertebral osteomyelitis. When available, these tests should be used in addition to conventional microbiology, especially in complex cases with extensively negative standard microbiological test results, to detect fastidious bacteria or to confirm the causative bacteria when their isolation and pathogenicity are unclear.

We retrospectively analyzed cirrhotic patients diagnosed with esophageal varices (EV) through clinical, laboratory, imaging, and endoscopic examinations from September 2021 to December 2023 in our hospital. All patients underwent LD-DE&PCT to acquire splenic iodine concentration and perfusion parameters. Radiation dose was recorded. Patients were classified into non-HREV and HREV groups based on endoscopy. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed, and the prediction model for HREV was constructed. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Univariate analysis revealed that significant differences were found in portal iodine concentration (PIC), blood flow (BF), permeability surface (PS), spleen volume (V-S), total iodine concentration (TIC), and total blood volume of the spleen (BV-S) between groups. TIC demonstrated the highest predictive value with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.87. Multivariate analysis showed that PIC, PS, and BV-S were independent risk factors for HREV. The logistic regression model for predicting HREV had an AUC of 0.93. The total radiation dose was 20.66 ± 4.07 mSv. Splenic hemodynamic parameters obtained from LD-DE&PCT can non-invasively and accurately assess the hemodynamic status of the spleen in cirrhotic patients with EV and predict the occurrence of HREV.

This retrospective in silico study analyzed electronic medical records from Thammasat University Hospital, covering the period from January 2012 to December 2022. The sample included subjects receiving antiresorptive therapy, excluding those with a history of radiation therapy or metastatic jaw disease. The primary predictor variable was the predicted probability of MRONJ development from the ML models. The outcome variable was MRONJ status coded as present or absent based on chart review. Covariates included demographic data, MRONJ occurrence, location and staging of MRONJ, comorbidities, diseases related to antiresorptive agents, types of antiresorptive agents, therapy duration, concurrent medications, blood calcium levels, and dental factors. Model performance was assessed via accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. Additionally, univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were conducted to identify factors significantly associated with MRONJ development. P ≤ .05 was statistically significant. The study analyzed data from 5,305 subjects with a mean age of 75 ± 11.1 years, predominantly female. MRONJ was observed in 81 cases (1.5%), with a median time to development of 33 months (interquartile range = 3). Among the 6 models tested, the best-performing model had an accuracy of 0.95 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89-0.90.

HFUS scans were imported into a software where first-order greyscale outcomes [i.e., mean echo intensity (EI)] and second-order greyscale outcomes were assessed. Other ultrasonographic outcomes of interest involved the vertical extension of the hypoechoic supracrestal area (HSA), soft-tissue area (STA) and buccal bone dehiscence (BBD), among others. HFUS EI mean values obtained from peri-implant soft tissue at healthy and diseased sites were 122.9 ± 19.7 and 107.9 ± 24.7 grey levels (GL); p = .02, respectively. All the diseased sites showed the appearance of an HSA that was not present in healthy implants (area under the curve = 1). The proportion of HSA/STA was 37.9% ± 14.8%.

Nonetheless, the performance of the logistic regression (LR) model in the original 2009 study was modest, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.68. The authors sought to use a larger dataset to develop more accurate machine learning (ML) models to predict endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) success and also to perform the largest validation of the ETVSS to date. The authors queried the MarketScan national database for the years 2005-2022 to identify patients < 18 years of age who underwent first-time ETV and subsequently had at least 6 months of continuous enrollment in the database. The authors collected data on predictors matching the original ETVSS: age, etiology of hydrocephalus, and history of any previous shunt placement. Next, they used 6 ML algorithms-LR, support vector classifier, random forest, k-nearest neighbors, Extreme Gradient Boosted Regression (XGBoost), and naive Bayes-to develop predictive models. Finally, the authors used nested cross-validation to assess the models' comparative performances on unseen data. The authors identified 2047 patients who met inclusion criteria, and 1261 (61.6%) underwent successful ETV. The performances of most ML models were similar to that of the original ETVSS, which had an AUROC of 0.693 on the validation set and 0.661 (95% CI 0.600-0.722) on the test set. The authors' new LR model performed comparably with AUROCs of 0.693 on both the validation and test sets, with 95% CI 0.633-0.754 on the test set. Among the more complex ML algorithms, XGBoost performed best, with AUROCs of 0.683 and 0.672 (95% CI 0.609-0.734) on the validation and test sets, respectively. This is the largest external validation of the ETVSS, and it confirms modest performance. More sophisticated ML algorithms do not meaningfully improve predictive performance compared to ETVSS; this underscores the need for higher utility, novelty, and dimensionality of input data rather than changes in modeling strategies.","2024","Journal of neurosurgery.

To study the impact of dicloxacillin/flucloxacillin on intestinal and hepatic expression of P-gp in vitro, we usd LS174T cells and 3D spheroids of primary human hepatocytes. Finally, we used nationwide Danish health registries and the UK's Clinical Practice Research Datalink to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) for the risk of stroke and systemic embolism following dicloxacillin/flucloxacillin exposure among DOAC users, using phenoxymethylpenicillin and amoxicillin as active comparators. Dicloxacillin reduced the area under the curve of dabigatran to a geometric mean ratio 10 days of 0.67 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.42-1.1) and geometric mean ratio 28 days of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.39-1.4), suggesting reduced oral absorption via increased P-gp expression. In vitro, dicloxacillin raised P-gp expression in both intestinal and liver cells, while flucloxacillin only affected liver cells. In the pharmacoepidemiologic study, dicloxacillin and flucloxacillin were not associated with increased risk of stroke/systemic embolism (dicloxacillin vs. phenoxymethylpenicillin HR: 0.93, 95% CI: 0.72-1.2; flucloxacillin vs. amoxicillin HR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.51-1.5). Dicloxacillin increases expression of intestinal P-gp, leading to reduced oral absorption of dabigatran.

Other evaluated measures included the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) scores at rest and on movement, the frequency of dermatomes blocked, onset time and effective plane, Quality of Requirements(QoR)-15 scale, chronic postsurgical pain, and the level of IL-6 and IL-8. The NRS scores were significantly higher in Group L than those in other groups (P < 0.05), indicating that the analgesic effect of Group L was the worst among the three groups. Group H had a lower effective plane of anesthesia and significantly higher incidence of chronic postsurgical pain. The IL-8 level was significantly lower in Group H than in other groups at 1 min, 1 h, and 24 h after SAPB. The ropivacaine concentrations were the highest in Group H, followed by Group M and Group L. The high blood concentration of ropivacaine in Group H may increase the risk of systemic toxicity from local anesthetics. Compared to Group L and Group H, Group M had superior analgesic effects and better safety. Among the three groups, Cmax, t1/2, and AUC0-∞ differed significantly. For patients undergoing VATS, using 0.5% ropivacaine for SAPB is recommended.","2025","Clinical therapeutics"

If hypermobility of the hip analysed with the pelvic femoral angle (∆PFA) has a high risk of impingement, the correlation between the range of motion of the hip from a standing to a flexed seated position and its implication in adverse spinopelvic mobility has not been described. A series of 337 patients treated with primary THA underwent lateral x-ray in standing and flexed seated positions to analyse ∆SPT, ∆PFA and spinopelvic parameters. The objectives were to establish a ∆PFA threshold associated with a ∆SPT ⩾20° and to subsequently investigate its influence in conjunction with spinopelvic risk factors on the occurrence of adverse spinopelvic mobility. The area under the curve was 0.904 (95%CI, 0.864-0.945) for ∆PFA to predict ∆SPT ⩾ 20°; it was predicted by ∆PFA ⩾ 95° with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 74.4% at the Youden optimal threshold. Patients with a ∆SPT < 20° (277 patients) had a mean ∆PFA of 83° compared to 110° if ∆SPT ⩾ 20° (60 patients) (p < 0.001). Patients with a ∆PFA < 95° (203 patients) had a mean ∆SPT of -6° compared to 18° if ∆PFA ⩾ 95° (134 patients) (p < 0.001). ∆PFA ⩾ 95° rates were 95% (57/60) and 27.8% (77/200) in patients with ∆SPT ⩾ 20° and ∆SPT < 20°, respectively (OR 49.35; CI, 15.01-162.28; p < 0.001). High mobility of the hip (∆PFA ⩾ 95°) seems to be a necessary condition for adverse spinopelvic mobility. A preoperative analysis of patients with lower hip mobility, associated with spinopelvic risk factors, might identify patients with abnormal spinopelvic mobility after the restoration of femoral flexion.

Both dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI data and multi-b-value (MBV) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were acquired in BC patients at two centers. Vector-radiomic and conventional-radiomic features were extracted from both DCE-MRI and MBV-DWI. After feature selection, the following models were built using the retained features and logistic regression: vector model, conventional model, and combined model that integrates the vector-radiomic and conventional-radiomic features. The models' performances were quantified by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). The training/external test set (center 1/2) included 483/361 women. For task 1, the vector model (AUCs=0.73∼0.86) was superior to (p<.05) the conventional model (AUCs=0.68∼0.81), and the addition of vector-radiomic features to conventional-radiomic features yielded an incremental predictive value (AUCs=0.80∼0.90, p<.05). For task 2, the combined MBV-DWI model (AUCs=0.85∼0.89) performed better than (p<.05) the conventional MBV-DWI model (AUCs=0.73∼0.82). In addition, for the combined DCE-MRI model and the combined MBV-DWI model, the former (AUCs=0.85∼0.90) outperformed (p<.05) the latter (AUCs=0.80∼0.85) in task 1, whereas the latter (AUCs=0.85∼0.89) outperformed (p<.05) the former (AUCs=0.76∼0.81) in task 2. The above results are true for the training and external test sets. MRI-based vector radiomics may predict BC HER2 status and its changes after NAT and provide significant incremental prediction over and above conventional radiomics.","2024","Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society"

This issue represents a medico-legal risk and may result in potential readmission, mortality, or revenue loss. Thus, understanding the factors that cause patients to ""leave against medical advice"" is vital to mitigate and potentially eliminate these adverse outcomes. This paper proposes a framework for studying the factors that affect LAMA in EDs. The framework integrates machine learning, metaheuristic optimization, and model interpretation techniques. Metaheuristic optimization is used for hyperparameter optimization-one of the main challenges of machine learning model development. Adaptive tabu simulated annealing (ATSA) metaheuristic algorithm is utilized for optimizing the parameters of extreme gradient boosting (XGB). The optimized XGB models are used to predict the LAMA outcomes for patients under treatment in ED. The designed algorithms are trained and tested using four data groups which are created using feature selection. The model with the best predictive performance is then interpreted using the SHaply Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method. The results show that best model has an area under the curve (AUC) and sensitivity of 76% and 82%, respectively. The best model was explained using SHAP method.","2024","Health care management science"

This study is a case-series with multiple subgroup analyses that divides the included patients into multiple subgroups based on various factors. Overall, 47 patients who underwent hUCB-MSC implantation were included. The patient-reported outcomes, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and second-look arthroscopy were used to assess the outcomes. Combined realignment surgery significantly correlated with clinical outcomes, particularly pain. No other factors significantly influenced the clinical outcomes in short-term period. Subgroups with large defect sizes or meniscal insufficiency showed significantly poor MRI and arthroscopy outcomes (MRI, P = 0.001, P = 0.001; arthroscopy, P = 0.032, P = 0.042). The logistic regression showed that patients with a 1 cm2 larger defect size were 1.91 times less likely to achieve favorable MRI outcomes (P = 0.017; odds ratio [OR], 1.91). Cut-off value to predict the poor outcome was >5.7 cm2 (area under the curve, 0.756). A cartilage defect size >5.7 cm2 was the major poor prognostic factor for cartilage regeneration on MRI (P = 0.010; OR, 17.46). If the postoperative alignment shifted by 1° opposite to the cartilage defect, it was 1.4 times more likely to achieve favorable MRI outcomes (P = 0.028; OR, 1.4). Combining realignment surgery showed a better prognosis for pain improvement. Cartilage defect size, meniscal function, and postoperative alignment are significant prognostic factors for cartilage regeneration.

This study aimed to evaluate the relationship between the neutrophil-to-albumin ratio (NAR) and overall survival (OS) in patients with NPC, as well as to develop a corresponding prognostic model. This retrospective analysis included 861 NPC patients treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), who were randomly divided into a training group (n = 605) and a validation group (n = 256). To identify factors associated with OS and construct a prognostic nomogram, both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed. The nomogram's prognostic accuracy was evaluated and independently validated. The NAR score successfully segregated NPC patients into two categories with significantly different OS (HR = 0.536; 95 % CI: 0.296-0.972, P = 0.040). Through multivariate analysis, factors such as age, T stage, N stage, and NAR score were identified as independent predictors of OS, leading to the creation of a prognostic nomogram. This nomogram demonstrated superior predictive capability for OS [C-index = 0.702 (95 % CI: 0.636-0.768)], surpassing that of the conventional staging system [C-index = 0.651 (95 % CI: 0.549-0.752)]. The findings underwent internal validation within an independent cohort. The NAR, an emergent biomarker combining nutritional and inflammatory status, offers a practical, low-cost, and non-invasive prognostic measure for NPC patients treated with CCRT.

From the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database, this study collected 4744 patients diagnosed with GSRC. These patients were randomized into a training cohort (n = 2320,) and a validation cohort (n = 1142). A restricted cubic spline (RCS) was used to determine the cut-off value for TS, and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were performed in the training cohort to identified significant predictors. A prognostic nomogram was constructed to predict OS at 3 and 5 years. Concordance index (C index), receiver operating characteristics curve (ROC curve), area under curve (AUC), and calibration curve were used to test the predictive accuracy of the model. A non-linear relationship was observed between TS and the risk of OS in GSRC, with TS thresholds at 4.4 cm and 9.6 cm. Survival was significantly lower in GSRC patients with TS > 4.4 cm. Age, marriage, chemotherapy, surgery, TS, SEER stage, regional lymph node status, and total number were independent predictors of OS. The C index in the training cohort was 0.748, and the AUC values for both 3- and 5-year OS were higher than 0.80. Similar results were observed in the validation cohort. In addition, the calibration curves showed good agreement between the predicted 3 year and 5 year OS and the actual OS. TS is a key prognostic factor for patients with GSRC, and patients with a TS of 4.4-9.6 cm and > 9.6 cm may have a poorer prognosis than those with a TS of < 4.4 cm. The TS-stratified nomogram we constructed and validated has favorable accuracy and calibration precision, and may be helpful in predicting the survival rate of patients.","2024","Updates in surgery"

Healthy participants (n = 8) performed a VP up- and down-direction discrimination task at full and subthreshold coherence through peripheral vision, and superimposed direction through visual imagery (VI) at central space under iNM and control conditions. iNM targets individualized anatomical and functional middle- and medial-superior temporal (MST) networks that control VP. We found that iNM engaged selective exteroceptive and interoceptive attention (SEIA) and motor planning (MP) networks. Specifically, iNM increased overall: (i) area under the curve of the BOLD magnitude: 100% in VP (but decreased for weak coherences), 21-47% in VI, 26-59% in MP and 48-76% in SEIA through encoding; and (ii) classification performance for each direction, coherence and network through decoding, predicting stimuli from brain maps. Our findings, derived from encoding and decoding models, suggest that mechanisms induced by iNM are causally linked in enhancing visuospatial networks and demonstrate iNM as a feasibility treatment for low-vision patients with cortical blindness or visuospatial impairments that precede cognitive decline.This article is part of the theme issue 'Neurofeedback: new territories and neurocognitive mechanisms of endogenous neuromodulation'.","2024","Philosophical transactions of the Royal Society of London.

Tail vein plasma was sampled 48 h after traumatic brain injury (TBI) from 143 rats (10 naïve, 21 controls, 112 with lateral fluid percussion injury) to quantify pNF-H by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. During the 6th postinjury month, rats underwent 30 days of continuous video-electroencephalographic monitoring to detect unprovoked seizures and evaluate epilepsy severity. Somatomotor (composite neuroscore) and spatial memory (Morris water maze) testing and quantitative T2 magnetic resonance imaging were performed to assess comorbidities and lesion severity. Of the 112 TBI rats, 25% (28/112) developed epilepsy (TBI+) and 75% (84/112) did not (TBI-). Plasma pNF-H concentrations were higher in TBI+ rats than in TBI- rats (p < .05). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that plasma pNF-H concentration distinguished TBI+ rats from TBI- rats (area under the curve [AUC] = .647, p < .05). Differentiation was stronger when comparing TBI+ rats exhibiting severe epilepsy (≥3 seizures/month) with all other TBI rats (AUC = .732, p < .01). Plasma pNF-H concentration on day 2 (D2) distinguished TBI+ rats with seizure clusters from other TBI rats (AUC = .732, p < .05). Higher plasma pNF-H concentration on D2 after TBI correlated with lower neuroscores on D2 (p < .001), D6 (p < .001), and D14 (p < .01). Higher pNF-H concentration on D2 correlated with greater T2 signal abnormality volume on D2 (p < .001) and D7 (p < .01) and larger cortical lesion area on D182 (p < .01). Plasma pNF-H concentration on D2 did not correlate with Morris water maze performance on D37-D39.

Automating MYC-R detection on hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained whole slide images of LBCL would decrease the need for costly molecular testing and improve pathologists' productivity. We developed an interpretable deep learning algorithm to detect MYC-R considering recent advances in self-supervised learning and providing an extensive comparison of 7 feature extractors and 6 multiple instance learning models, themselves. Four different multicentric cohorts, including 1247 patients with LBCL, were used for training and validation. The best deep learning model reached an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve score of 81.9% during crossvalidation on the largest LBCL cohort, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve scores ranging from 62.2% to 74.5% when evaluated on other unseen cohorts. In addition, we demonstrated that using this model as a prescreening tool (with a false-negative rate of 0%), fluorescence in situ hybridization testing would be avoided in 35% of cases.

The aims of this study were to describe the relationships between echocardiographic and catheterization and cMRI measures of readiness for DSO and to develop risk factors for left ventricular (LV) dysfunction after DSO on the basis of echocardiographic measures of ventricular-arterial coupling (VAC). Patients with ccTGA undergoing LV retraining at a DSO referral center were reviewed. LVEF measured by echocardiography was compared with that measured by cMRI, and LV:RVp measured by echocardiography was compared with that measured by catheterization using Bland-Altman analysis. The relationship between preoperative VAC markers and postoperative echocardiography was analyzed using ventricular end-systolic elastance (EES) and a novel marker consisting of the product of LVEF and LV:RVp (EFPR). Thirty-one patients with 56 evaluations for DSO were included, 24 of whom underwent DSO. Echocardiographic LVEF correlated well with cMRI LVEF (r = 0.79), and Bland-Altman analysis slightly overestimated cMRI LVEF (mean difference, +3%). Echocardiographic LVEF had a moderate ability to identify normal cMRI LVEF (area under the curve, 0.80) and at an optimal cut point of echocardiographic LVEF threshold of 61%, there was 71% sensitivity and 76% specificity to detect cMRI LVEF ≥ 55%. Echocardiographic LV:RVp correlated well with LV/RVp by catheterization (r = 0.77) and slightly underestimated the catheterization value (mean difference, -0.11). Echocardiographic LV:RVp had a good ability to identify adequate LV:RVp by catheterization (area under the curve, 0.95) and at an optimal echocardiography cut point of 0.75 had 100% sensitivity and 85% specificity to detect a catheterization LV:RVp >0.9. Echocardiography-based criteria for DSO readiness (echocardiographic LVEF of 61% and LV:RVp of 0.75) demonstrated specificity of 97% and positive predictive value of 96% for published criteria of DSO readiness (cMRI LVEF of 55% and catheterization LV:RVp of 0.9). EES and EFPR correlated with post-DSO LVEF (ρ = 0.72 and ρ = 0.60, respectively). EFPR of 0.51 demonstrated 78% sensitivity and 100% specificity for post-DSO LV dysfunction (LVEF < 55%). Age at first PAB also strongly correlated with post-DSO LVEF (ρ = 0.75). No patient with first PAB at <1 year of age exhibited post-DSO LV dysfunction. Echocardiographic measures of LVEF and LV:RVp are reliable indicators of reference standard modalities and can guide management during retraining. The preoperative VAC markers EES and EFPR may be useful markers of post-DSO LV dysfunction. Values of echocardiographic LV:RVp >0.75 are likely to meet pressure-generation criteria for DSO and should be considered for referral to catheterization and cMRI evaluation for DSO. PAB placement before 1 year of life may optimize LV outcomes in patients considered for DSO.","2024","Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography"

Therefore, identifying the predictive factors for early progression is critical for timely therapeutic adjustment and the optimization of patient outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study enrolled patients with liver cancer who received their first ICI combined with targeted therapy at the Fifth Medical Center of the PLA General Hospital between June 2022 and December 2023. Early tumor progression was defined as tumor progression within 6 months of therapy initiation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for early tumor progression, and overall survival (OS) curves were generated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results: A total of 159 patients were enrolled. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that patients with an early alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) response had a significantly reduced risk of early tumor progression (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.13-0.84, p = 0.019), suggesting that an early AFP response is a protective factor against early progression. The area under curve (AUC) for the predictive model was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.63-0.83, p < 0.001). Stratified survival analysis showed that the median overall survival (mOS) in the early AFP response group was significantly longer than that in the poor response group (17.3 months vs. 6.1 months, HR = 2.11, 95% CI: 1.19-2.74, p = 0.009). Conclusions: Early AFP response is not only an effective biomarker for identifying high-risk patients prone to early tumor progression but is also significantly associated with long-term survival in liver cancer patients treated with ICI combined with targeted therapy. This finding will enable clinicians to make timely therapeutic adjustments and optimize treatment outcomes, thereby improving both progression-free survival and overall survival.","2024","Biomedicines"

We studied aortic stiffness using cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-assessed ventriculo-arterial coupling (VAC) and novel aortic (AO) global longitudinal strain (GLS) combined with targeted metabolomic profiling. Among community older adults without cardiovascular disease, VAC was calculated as aortic pulse wave velocity (PWV), a marker of arterial stiffness, divided by left ventricular (LV) GLS. AOGLS was the maximum absolute strain measured by tracking the phasic distance between brachiocephalic artery origin and aortic annulus. In 194 subjects (71 ± 8.6 years; 88 women), AOGLS (mean 5.6 ± 2.1%) was associated with PWV (R = -0.3644, p < 0.0001), LVGLS (R = 0.2756, p = 0.0001) and VAC (R = -0.3742, p <0.0001). Stiff aorta denoted by low AOGLS <4.26% (25th percentile) was associated with age (OR 1.13, 95% CI 1.04-1.24, p = 0.007), body mass index (OR 1.12, 95% CI 1.01-1.25, p = 0.03), heart rate (OR 1.04, 95% CI 1.01-1.06, p = 0.011) and metabolites of medium-chain fatty acid oxidation: C8 (OR 1.005, p = 0.026), C10 (OR 1.003, p = 0.036), C12 (OR 1.013, p = 0.028), C12:2-OH/C10:2-DC (OR 1.084, p = 0.032) and C16-OH (OR 0.82, p = 0.006). VAC was associated with changes in long-chain hydroxyl and dicarboxyl carnitines. Multivariable models that included acyl-carnitine metabolites, but not amino acids, significantly increased the discrimination over clinical risk factors for prediction of AOGLS (AUC [area-under-curve] 0.73 to 0.81, p = 0.037) and VAC (AUC 0.78 to 0.87, p = 0.0044). Low AO GLS and high VAC were associated with altered medium-chain and long-chain fatty acid oxidation, respectively, which may identify early metabolic perturbations in aging-associated aortic stiffening.

To validate two bacteraemia prediction models in a high-complexity hospital in Colombia. External validation study of the ID-BactER and Shapiro scores based on a consecutive cohort of patients who underwent blood culture within 48 h of ED admission. Scale calibration was assessed by comparing expected and observed events (calibration belt). Discriminatory ability was assessed by area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC). We included 1347 patients, of whom 18.85% were diagnosed with CAB. The most common focus of infection was the respiratory tract (36.23%), and the most common microorganism was Escherichia coli (52.15%). The Shapiro score underestimated the risk in all categories and its discriminatory ability was poor (AUC 0.68 CI 95% 0.64-0.73). In contrast, the ID-BactER score showed an adequate observed/expected event ratio of 1.07 (CI 0.85-1.36; p = 0.018) and adequate calibration when expected events were greater than 20%, in addition to good discriminatory ability (AUC 0.74 95% CI 0.70-0.78). The Shapiro score is not calibrated, and its discriminatory ability is poor. ID-BactER has an adequate calibration when the expected events are higher than 20%.

This study aimed to identify genetic risk factors within the major histocompatibility complex for JIAU and evaluate their contribution for improving risk classification when combined with clinical risk factors. Data on single nucleotide polymorphisms, amino acids, and classical HLA alleles were available for 2,497 patients with JIA without uveitis and 579 patients with JIAU (female 2,060, male 1,015). Analysis was restricted to patients with inferred European ancestry. Forward conditional logistic regression identified genetic markers exceeding a Bonferroni-corrected significance (6 × 10-6). Multivariable logistic regression estimated the effects of clinical and genetic risk factors, and a likelihood ratio test calculated the improvement in model fit when adding genetic factors. Uveitis risk classification performance of a model integrating genetic and clinical risk factors was estimated using area under the receiver operator characteristic curve and compared with a model of clinical risk factors alone. Three genetic risk factors were identified, mapping to HLA-DRB1, HLA-DPB1, and HLA-A. These markers were statistically independent from clinical risk factors and significantly improved the fit of a model when included with clinical risk factors (P = 3.3 × 10-23). The addition of genetic markers improved the classification of JIAU compared with a model of clinical risk factors alone (area under the curve 0.75 vs 0.71). Integration of a genetic and clinical risk prediction model outperforms a model based solely on clinical risk factors. Future JIAU risk prediction models should include genetic risk factors.","2024","Arthritis & rheumatology (Hoboken, N.J.)"

We aimed to evaluate whether annual mean length of stay (LOS) is associated with the incidence of VTE and develop a generalizable machine learning model to preoperatively predict the incidence of symptomatic VTE following total hip and TKA using National Surgical Quality Improvement Program. Annual incidence of 30-day postoperative VTE, deep vein thrombosis, and pulmonary embolism was calculated over 6 years and tested for trend. Correlation between annual VTE rates and mean LOS was calculated. Predictive models (logistic regression, random forest, and XGBoost) were trained and tested based on year of surgery with different oversampling algorithms used to address data imbalance. A total of 498,314 patients were included, with 0.88% developing a VTE within 30 days. VTE rates decreased from 1.11% in 2014 to 0.76% in 2019 (P < .001). There was a strong correlation between the yearly incidence of VTE, pulmonary embolism, and deep vein thrombosis and mean LOS (r = 0.96, 0.87, and 0.98, respectively). Univariate analysis demonstrated that TKA, inpatient setting, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, and various patient comorbidities were significantly associated with VTE. The logistic regression model trained on all data with a balanced loss scoring function performed the best (area under the curve = 0.600). This study revealed declining VTE rates strongly correlated to decreasing postoperative LOS and identified patient and surgery-specific factors associated with VTE risk.

Patients with COVID-19 hospitalized at the Affiliated Baiyun Hospital of Guizhou Medical University from March 2022 to March 2024 were selected as study participants. A total of 589 patients met the inclusion and exclusion criteria, 68 patients complicated with AKI were classified as AKI group, and the remaining 521 cases were divided into proportion sampling method and randomly selected 200 samples, which were classified as non-AKI group. Additionally, 50 healthy controls were enrolled as the control group. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify the relevant factors associated with complicated AKI in patients with COVID-19. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to evaluate the prognostic efficacy of plasma suPAR, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 indicators for complicated AKI in patients with COVID-19. Among the patients with COVID-19 in the AKI group, 43 were males (63.20 %), with a median age of 79.00 (interquartile range: 75.00, 83.00) years, while the non-AKI group comprised 83 males (41.50 %), with a median age of 73.00 (interquartile range: 60.00, 80.75) years. Comparison of the sex and age between the two groups indicated that males and elderly patients had increased risks of complicated AKI (P < 0.05). Plasma levels of suPAR, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 in the AKI group were significantly higher than those in the non-AKI group (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis indicated that suPAR and sTNFR2 were independent factors influencing complicated AKI in patients with COVID-19 (P < 0.05). The ROC curve for a single indicator showed that suPAR had the highest prognostic efficacy for complicated AKI, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.813, a sensitivity of 79.4 %, and a specificity of 74.0 %. The combined use of suPAR and sTNFR2 for risk assessment yielded the highest AUC of 0.838, with a sensitivity of 66.2 % and a specificity of 87.5 %. The combined risk assessment using all three indicators (suPAR, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2) had an AUC of 0.837, with a sensitivity of 64.7 % and a specificity of 89.0 %. Elderly patients had increased risks of complicated AKI. Indicators such as suPAR, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 can assist in assessing the risk in patients with COVID-19 complicated AKI, with suPAR demonstrating the highest prognostic efficacy as a single indicator. The combined detection of suPAR, sTNFR1, and sTNFR2 offers greater prognostic value than using any single indicator.","2024","Experimental gerontology"

TJAs are generally safe, but complications can occur. Although historically performed as inpatient procedures, TJAs are increasingly being performed in the outpatient setting. We sought to develop a scientifically acceptable cross-setting measure for evaluating care quality across inpatient and outpatient settings. Using Medicare administrative claims and enrollment data for qualifying TJA patients, we respecified the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) inpatient-only risk-standardized TJA complications measure to assess complication rates following elective primary TJAs performed in an inpatient or outpatient setting. We aligned inpatient and outpatient coding practices and used hierarchical logistic regression to calculate hospital-specific, risk-standardized complication rates (RSCRs). Lower rates correspond to better quality. Using accepted approaches for CMS measures, we tested measure reliability and vetted key measure decisions with patient and provider input. A single combined model including the procedure setting as a risk variable produced the highest discrimination (C-statistic for a single combined model with a setting indicator: 0.664, C-statistic for the inpatient-only model: 0.651, C-statistic for the outpatient-only model: 0.638). Among the 2,747 hospitals with at least 25 TJAs, the mean RSCR (using the combined model with a setting indicator) was 2.91% (median RSCR: 2.85%; interquartile range: 2.59% to 3.18%). The median odds ratio for complication occurrence at a higher-risk hospital compared with a lower-risk hospital was 1.33. We respecified a measure to assess hospital inpatient or outpatient TJA performance and evaluated the reliability and validity of the measure. The findings showed variation in hospital-level complication rates across settings as indicated by this measure, supporting the feasibility of evaluating hospital performance using a more representative population than inpatient TJAs alone.

Tactical necessity can render removal of wet clothing impossible and/or require Warfighters to remain static to avoid detection, limiting heat production and posing a threat of hypothermia (core temperature <35 °C). This study aimed to characterize body temperatures and evaluate hypothermia risk while statically exposed to 5 °C air wearing three wet military uniforms. Further, low-speed loaded walking was evaluated as a strategy to raise end-static temperatures. Twelve adults (11 M, 1 F) randomly completed three wet-cold trials wearing either the Improved Hot Weather Combat Uniform (IHWCU), Army Combat Uniform (ACU), or ACU with silk-weight base layer (ACU+). Each trial involved 180 min of cold air (5.3 ± 0.3 °C, 0.8 m·s-1) exposure after a clothed 2 min head-out immersion (34.0 ± 0.2 °C). Volunteers were static for 60 min followed by 120 min of walking with a rucksack. Rectal temperature (Tre) area under the curve did not differ among the three wet uniforms when static (p = 0.431) with Tre increasing, rather than decreasing, across the 60 min (IHWCU: +0.26 ± 0.19 °C, ACU: +0.37 ± 0.21 °C, ACU+: +0.36 ± 0.20 °C). Hypothermia risk with 60 min static wet-cold exposure therefore appears minimal, regardless of the military uniform worn, in an otherwise low stress cohort.

Persisters are associated with chronic and recurrent infections for pathogens including Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Understanding persister profiles of newer antibiotics such as cefiderocol and ceftolozane/tazobactam against P. aeruginosa is warranted as these agents generally target difficult-to-treat infections. Persister formation was assessed using in vitro assays against nine clinical P. aeruginosa isolates exposed to cefiderocol or ceftolozane/tazobactam. Quantitative persister assays were performed using a stationary phase of bacteria challenged with 10-fold MIC drug concentrations. Persisters were quantitated as the percent persisters at 24 h and the log ratio (LR) difference in AUC for cfu for each antibiotic alone compared with growth control. The tolerance disc test (TDtest) was used to qualitatively detect persisters. Percent persisters at 24 h was lower with cefiderocol compared with ceftolozane/tazobactam for six of the nine tested isolates. Eight of the nine isolates had higher reduction in LR for cefiderocol groups, suggesting an overall higher and more rapid bacterial reduction in cefiderocol groups. For cefiderocol, five of the nine tested isolates lacked regrowth after replacement with glucose disc, suggesting no persistence via the TDtest. For ceftolozane/tazobactam, three isolates lacked persister formation. Cefiderocol resulted in less bacterial persistence relative to ceftolozane/tazobactam against nine clinical P. aeruginosa isolates. Cefiderocol's siderophore mechanism may be advantageous over ceftolozane/tazobactam through enhanced anti-persister effects. Clinical correlation of these findings is warranted as persisters can lead to antibiotic resistance and treatment failure.","2024","The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy"

Tumor contact length (TCL) was assessed curvilinearly and linearly on T2-weighted imaging (T2WI), ADC maps, and dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI by two radiologists. MRI-based EPE positivity was defined as a curvilinear or linear contact length of >15 mm. Statistical comparisons were conducted using chi-squared and independent samples t-tests, with interreader agreement evaluated using weighted κ statistics. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of EPE, and two prediction models were constructed. Diagnostic performance was assessed using receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. A total of 32 (38%) and 52 (62%) patients with EPE and non-EPE, respectively, were included in this study. Patients with EPE demonstrated significantly larger tumor sizes, lower ADC values, and lower ADC ratios than those without EPE (p < 0.001). The curvilinear and linear TCL measurements for each sequence exhibited statistically significant correlations with EPE for both readers, with strong interreader agreement. Curvilinear TCL (c-TCL) and linear TCL (l-TCL) on DCE-MRI showed higher area under the curve (AUC) values than the other measurements for EPE prediction (reader 1: 0.815 and 0.803, reader 2: 0.746 and 0.713, respectively). However, there was no statistically significant difference between c-TCL and l-TCL. Multivariable models with mean ADC value improved predictive performance. Model 2 (ADC, ISUP, and c-TCL on DCE images) surpassed model 1 (ADC and c-TCL on DCE images) with an AUC of 0.919 and 0.874, respectively. DCE-MRI demonstrated superior performance in predicting EPE compared to other sequences. Linear and curvilinear measurements had comparable diagnostic performance. Being more practical and easier, radiologists may use l-TCL measurement in daily practice. The mean ADC value provided additional diagnostic value.","2024","European journal of radiology"
574,"39578335","Development of RT-LAMP assay for detection of lead and cadmium toxicity using HepG2 cells.","Heavy metals such as lead and cadmium are prevalent in the environment. These are harmful to living beings even at lower concentrations as they persist in the body for years and lead to the development of severe diseases. Therefore, the present work was designed to develop a rapid and field-applicable cell-based assay for quick detection of lead and cadmium in biofluids using an RNA biomarker. The RNA biomarker was identified by analyzing the impact of these heavy metals on the gene expression of candidate genes using HepG2 cells. The results showed that the gene expression of AhR pathway-related genes, apoptosis-related genes, MAPK1, and HMOX1 were significantly increased after lead and cadmium treatments (P < 0.05). Interestingly, the gene expression of HMOX1 was increased linearly up to fivefold in a dose and time-dependent manner in the case of both heavy metals which also correlated with an increased secretion of bilirubin from the cells after 6 h treatment. Therefore, the RT-LAMP assay was developed for lead and cadmium toxicity using HMOX1. The positive amplification was visualized in the form of color change of HNB dye from violet to blue in 30 min. Additionally, standard curves were also prepared for the RT-LAMP color change after treatment with different concentrations of lead and cadmium for their quantification in unknown samples. The developed RT-LAMP assay was also validated using lead and cadmium-spiked milk samples. The ROC curve analysis showed 100% sensitivity and specificity for both heavy metals above their MRL value in infant milk substitutes and infant foods. This assay can be utilized for early detection of heavy metals in common food items such as milk.","2024","Environmental science and pollution research international"
575,"39641615","Highly Sensitive Multiplexed Sensing of miRNAs in a Gastric Cancer Patient's Liquid Biopsy.","Gastric cancer (GC) is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality in the world. Most patients are in the advanced stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis because the symptoms of early gastric cancer patients are not obvious. Early diagnosis of gastric cancer is still challenging due to the high cost, invasiveness, and low accuracy of traditional diagnostic methods such as endoscopy and biopsy. Herein, we develop clinically accurate and highly sensitive detection of multiple GC miRNA biomarkers in human serum using an isothermal nucleic acid primer exchange reaction (PER). The isothermal nucleic acid primer exchange reaction demonstrates high sensitivity and robustness, exemplified by a one-pot reaction achieving a detection limit of 28.71 fM. By quantifying the levels of three miRNA biomarkers selected through bioinformatics analysis in gastric cancer serum samples, the diagnostic approach effectively distinguished between clinical gastric cancer patients (n = 25) and noncancer controls (n = 10). The performance of our three-miRNA signature in discriminating between GC and controls was as follows: area under the curve (AUC): 0.808, sensitivity: 89%, specificity: 88%, positive predictive value (PPV): 96%, and negative predictive value (NPV): 70%.","2024","Analytical chemistry"

This retrospective study collected patients through the electronic medical records (EMR) or pathological reports at Mayo Clinic and underwent BP MRI from January 2002 to December 2022. Using sagittal T1, fluid-sensitive and post-gadolinium images, a radiology panel selected BP's region of interest (ROI) to form 3 dimensional volumes for this study. We designed six deep learning schemes to conduct BP abnormality differentiation across three MRI sequences. Utilizing five prestigious deep learning networks as the backbone, we trained and validated these models by nested five-fold cross-validation schemes. Furthermore, we defined a 'method score' derived from the radar charts as a quantitative indicator as the guidance of the preference of the best model. This study selected 196 patients from initial 267 candidates. A total of 256 BP MRI series were compiled from them, comprising 123 normal and 133 abnormal series. The abnormal series included 4 sub-categories, et al. breast cancer (22.5 %), lymphoma (27.1 %), inflammatory conditions (33.1 %) and others (17.2 %). The best-performing model was produced by feature merging mode with triple MRI joint strategy (AUC, 92.2 %; accuracy, 89.5 %) exceeding the multiple channel merging mode (AUC, 89.6 %; accuracy, 89.0 %), solo channel volume mode (AUC, 89.2 %; accuracy, 86.7 %) and the remaining. Evaluated by method score (maximum 2.37), the feature merging mode with backbone of VGG16 yielded the highest score of 1.75 under the triple MRI joint strategy. Deployment of deep learning models across sagittal T1, fluid-sensitive and post-gadolinium MRI sequences demonstrated great potential for brachial plexopathy diagnosis. Our findings indicate that utilizing feature merging mode and multiple MRI joint strategy may offer satisfied deep learning model for BP abnormalities than solo-sequence analysis.","2024","European journal of radiology"

This study aimed to determine if the lesion filling index (LFI), obtained via quantitative digital subtraction angiography (QDSA), can predict complete complete obliteration after Gamma knife radiosurgery (GKRS). We retrospectively reviewed AVM patients who underwent GKRS and DSA exams from 2011 to 2021. Clinical, angioarchitectural, and QDSA hemodynamic features were analyzed. The LFI, derived from QDSA, was evaluated as a predictor of complete complete obliteration post-SRS using Cox proportional hazards and Kaplan-Meier analyses. Among 118 AVMs with a mean follow-up of 5.76 ± 2.76 years, post-SRS complete obliteration was linked to reduced nidus volume (7.27 ± 12.3 vs. 19.2 ± 35.7 mm³, p = 0.049), smaller nidus diameter (26.0 ± 14.9 vs. 34.1 ± 19.8 mm, p = 0.015), and absence of feeding artery dilation (21.1% vs. 46.3%, p = 0.008). Higher Arterial Diagnostic Window (ADW) (972.27 ± 1615.53 vs. 515.29 ± 730.26, p = 0.036), higher LFI (905.31 ± 2288.37 vs. 249.65 ± 1092.46, p = 0.037), and lower Transnidal Relative Velocity (TRV), a parameter defined as the maximum diameter of AVM divided by the full width at half maximum (74.31 ± 95.67 vs. 137.80 ± 152.01, p = 0.021), were also associated with complete obliteration. After adjusting for confounders, only two variables-absence of feeding artery dilation (HR 0.35, 95%CI 0.16-0.78, p = 0.010) and higher LFI (HR 1.00, 95%CI 1.00-1.00, p = 0.006) remained significant predictors. The ROC curve identified 188.4 as the LFI cutoff, and Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed LFI's predictive value (log-rank test, χ² = 12.776, p < 0.001). Elevated LFI and absence of feeding artery dilation predict AVM complete obliteration after GKRS, indicating that overfilling and low blood flow in the nidus may promote complete obliteration.","2024","Neurosurgical review"

Arthroplasty literature has demonstrated discharge disposition to postacute care facilities carries major risks regarding the need for revision surgery, patient comorbidities, and financial burden. To quantify, categorize, and mitigate risks, a decision tool that uses preoperative patient variables has previously been published and validated using an urban patient population. The aim of our investigation was to validate the same predictive model using patients in a rural setting undergoing total knee arthroplasty (TKA) and total hip arthroplasty. All TKA and THA procedures that were performed between January 2012 and September 2022 at our institution were collected. A total of 9,477 cases (39.6% TKA, 60.4% THA) were included for the validation analysis. There were 9 preoperative variables that were extracted in an automated fashion from the electronic medical record. Included patients were then run through the predictive model, generating a risk score representing that patient's differential risk of discharge to a skilled nursing facility versus home. Overall accuracy, sensitivity and specificity were calculated after obtaining risk scores. Score cutoff equally maximizing sensitivity and specificity was 0.23, and the proportion of correct classifications by the predictive tool in this study population was found to be 0.723, with an area under the curve of 0.788 - both higher than previously published accuracy levels. With the threshold of 0.23, sensitivity and specificity were found to be 0.720 and 0.723, respectively. The risk calculator showed very good accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity in predicting discharge location for rural patients undergoing TKA and THA, with accuracy even higher than in urban populations. The model provides an easy-to-use interface, with automation representing a viable tool in helping with shared decision-making regarding postoperative discharge plans.","2024","The Journal of arthroplasty"

From March 2021 to May 2023, 82 participants with breast cancer treated with anthracyclines with/without trastuzumab were prospectively recruited. Cardiac magnetic resonance was performed at baseline, 3 and 6 months in relation to baseline. T1ρ, T1 and T2 values were measured and compared by repeated measures analyses of variance. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to assess the performance in predicting subsequent CTRCD. Nineteen (23.17 %) participants developed CTRCD. T1ρ and T1 values progressively increased over time (all p < 0.001), while T2 values increased at 3 (p < 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively) and 6 months (all p < 0.001) compared to baseline in both the CTRCD (+) and CTRCD (-) groups. The changes in T1ρ (OR, 3.892, p = 0.003) and T1 (OR, 1.082, p = 0.002) from baseline to 3 months were associated with subsequent CTRCD. The combination of the changes in T1ρ and T1 from baseline to 3 months obtained an improved area under the curve of 0.853. T1ρ, T1 and T2 increased after treatment of anthracyclines with/without trastuzumab.

580,"39067757","Utility of an in-line somatic cell count sensor for selecting cows for dry-cow therapy.","Minimizing the use of antimicrobials at the end of lactation (dry-cow therapy) requires categorizing cows as being likely infected or uninfected. Although microbiology is the gold standard for such categorization, the cost of such tests means that indirect tests, such as SCC, are commonly used. An in-line SCC sensor (SenseHub In-Line Somatic Cell Count; MSD Animal Health) is commercially available, but its utility in differentiating cows eligible for dry-cow therapy has not been assessed. Our prospective diagnostic accuracy study was undertaken to define the sensitivity (Se) and specificity (Sp) of SenseHub SCC on cow-composite milk samples submitted for conventional microbiology. A secondary objective was to assess the utility of SenseHub SCC compared with the maximum or last DHI SCC determined from cow-composite milk samples collected as part of routine herd production recording at monthly intervals throughout lactation. Cows (n = 1,544) from 4 spring-calving, predominantly pasture-fed dairy herds from 3 regions of New Zealand had cow-composite milk samples collected following aseptic teat end preparation immediately before or after the final milking of lactation. These samples were submitted for routine microbiology. The microbiology data from approximately half the cows (n = 770; training dataset) were randomly selected after blocking for IMI status within herd, and these data were used to determine the optimal predictor for indicating IMI from the in-line SCC data. This determination was made by maximizing the area under the curve (AUC) for the receiver operator curve. The average of the in-line SCC over the final 12 wk of lactation (in-line 12wSCC) was found to be the best predictor and was used for further analyses. The Se and Sp of the in-line SCC for any IMI or for a major pathogen IMI (defined as the presence of Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, or Streptococcus uberis) was calculated using the test dataset (n = 774). The AUC for the maximum and last DHI SCC were compared with that of the in-line 12wSCC. The cow-level prevalence of any IMI or a major IMI across the entire population was 50.6% and 14.2%, respectively. At a cut-point of 150,000 cells/mL, Se and Sp of the in-line 12wSCC for any IMI was 0.68 (95% CI 0.64-0.72) and 0.71 (95% CI 0.65-0.76), respectively, and the Se and Sp for a major pathogen IMI was 0.89 (95% CI 0.82-0.95) and 0.51 (95% CI 0.47-0.55), respectively. The AUC for a major pathogen IMI was 0.82 (95% CI 0.79-0.86), 0.82 (95% CI 0.78-0.86), and 0.84 (95% CI 0.90-0.97) for in-line 12wSCC, maximum DHI SCC, and last DHI SCC, respectively. These AUC did not differ, and the AUC for the in-line 12wSCC was noninferior to that of the last and maximum DHI SCC. Given that the in-line 12wSCC had an AUC, Se, and Sp not different from DHI SCC data, we concluded that this test has utility in selecting cows for different dry-cow therapy treatments.","2024","Journal of dairy science"
581,"39685852","The Prognostic Role of RDW in Hospitalized Heart Failure Patients with and Without Chronic Kidney Disease.","Background: Chronic kidney disease (CKD) and heart failure (HF) are interrelated conditions that exacerbate each other through mechanisms like fluid retention, neurohormonal activation, and inflammation. Red blood cell distribution width (RDW), a measure of red blood cell size variability, has emerged as a potential prognostic marker in HF. This study aimed to assess the prognostic value of RDW in HF patients, both with and without CKD, focusing on all-cause mortality and HF rehospitalizations. Methods: This observational retrospective study included 171 patients hospitalized for acute decompensated HF in a tertiary university hospital in Greece. Patients were divided into two groups based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), as Group 1 (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) and Group 2 (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). RDW was measured upon admission, and outcomes of interest were all-cause mortality and HF rehospitalizations over a median follow-up period of 6.1 months. Statistical analyses included Kaplan-Meier survival curves, whereas the discrimination traits of RDW were evaluated by constructing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and by calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUC). A p-value <0.05 was indicative of a statistically important result. Results: Patients in Group 1 (eGFR < 60 mL/min/1.73 m2) were older (80 (73-86) vs. 75 (62-83)) and manifested higher median RDW values (16.6 (15.0-18.8) vs. 15.6 (14.1-17.8)) and received less frequent (57.9% vs. 75%) mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRAs) as compared to those in Group 2 (eGFR ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2). RDW demonstrated better prognostic value in predicting combined mortality and rehospitalization outcomes in Group 2 patients (area under the curve: 0.70; 95% CI (0.62-0.80)) compared to those in Group 1 (area under the curve: 0.53; 95% CI (0.35-0.72)). No statistically significant differences (p = 0.579) were observed in survival between patients with high (≥15%) and low (<15%) RDW values in the overall population, though trends favored worse outcomes with elevated RDW. Similarly, no significant differences (p = 0.374) were observed in survival between patients with high (Group 2) and low (Group 1) eGFR values. Conclusions: RDW appears to be a meaningful prognostic biomarker for HF patients, particularly in those without CKD. Further multicenter studies are needed to validate its clinical utility and potential for guiding treatment in this high-risk population.","2024","Journal of clinical medicine"

Pelvic MRI with the mDIXON Quant sequence was performed on 23 cryptorchidism patients and 15 normal controls. The TFC before and after surgery was measured and compared. The correlations between cryptorchid TFC and testosterone (TSTO), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and estradiol (E2) levels were analyzed, as was the specificity of TFC and each hormone for assessing testicular function after surgery. The preoperative cryptorchid TFC (3.06% ± 0.74) was higher than that of the normal controls (1.36% ± 0.49). TSTO was negatively correlated with the cryptorchid TFC (r = -0.698), while FSH and E2 were positively associated with the cryptorchid TFC (r = 0.658, 0.676). Cryptorchid TFC after surgery (2.01% ± 0.55) was lower than the preoperative TFC, but hormone levels were not significantly different. The TFC after surgery (0.864) had a larger AUC value than did TSTO (0.639), FSH (0.597), and E2 (0.586). Noninvasive quantification of cryptorchid TFC using the mDIXON Quant sequence is more specific than hormone levels for assessing postsurgical changes in testicular function. The cryptorchid testicular fat content is significantly higher than the normal testicular fat content. Cryptorchid testicular fat content is negatively correlated with presurgical serum TSTO levels and positively correlated with presurgical FSH and E2 levels. Pre- and postoperative changes in cryptorchid testicular fat content change are more sensitive than changes in TSTO, FSH, or E2 levels. Noninvasive cryptorchid testicular fat content quantified by the mDIXON Quant sequence is more specific than serum TSTO, FSH, and E2 levels for assessing changes in testicular function after cryptorchidism surgery.","2024","Pediatric research"

Currently available survival prediction tools, however, were generated using data from patients treated either operatively or with local radiation alone, raising concerns about whether they would generalize well to all patients presenting for assessment. The Skeletal Oncology Research Group machine-learning algorithm (SORG-MLA), trained with institution-based data of surgically treated patients, and the Metastases location, Elderly, Tumor primary, Sex, Sickness/comorbidity, and Site of radiotherapy model (METSSS), trained with registry-based data of patients treated with radiotherapy alone, are two of the most recently developed survival prediction models, but they have not been tested on patients whose local treatment strategy is not yet decided. (1) Which of these two survival prediction models performed better in a mixed cohort made up both of patients who received local treatment with surgery followed by radiotherapy and who had radiation alone for symptomatic bone metastases? (2) Which model performed better among patients whose local treatment consisted of only palliative radiotherapy? (3) Are laboratory values used by SORG-MLA, which are not included in METSSS, independently associated with survival after controlling for predictions made by METSSS? Between 2010 and 2018, we provided local treatment for 2113 adult patients with skeletal metastases in the extremities at an urban tertiary referral academic medical center using one of two strategies: (1) surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy or (2) palliative radiotherapy alone. Every patient's survivorship status was ascertained either by their medical records or the national death registry from the Taiwanese National Health Insurance Administration. After applying a priori designated exclusion criteria, 91% (1920) were analyzed here. Among them, 48% (920) of the patients were female, and the median (IQR) age was 62 years (53 to 70 years). Lung was the most common primary tumor site (41% [782]), and 59% (1128) of patients had other skeletal metastases in addition to the treated lesion(s). In general, the indications for surgery were the presence of a complete pathologic fracture or an impending pathologic fracture, defined as having a Mirels score of ≥ 9, in patients with an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification of less than or equal to IV and who were considered fit for surgery. The indications for radiotherapy were relief of pain, local tumor control, prevention of skeletal-related events, and any combination of the above. In all, 84% (1610) of the patients received palliative radiotherapy alone as local treatment for the target lesion(s), and 16% (310) underwent surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy. Neither METSSS nor SORG-MLA was used at the point of care to aid clinical decision-making during the treatment period. Survival was retrospectively estimated by these two models to test their potential for providing survival probabilities. We first compared SORG to METSSS in the entire population. Then, we repeated the comparison in patients who received local treatment with palliative radiation alone. We assessed model performance by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), calibration analysis, Brier score, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The AUROC measures discrimination, which is the ability to distinguish patients with the event of interest (such as death at a particular time point) from those without. AUROC typically ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 indicating random guessing and 1.0 a perfect prediction, and in general, an AUROC of ≥ 0.7 indicates adequate discrimination for clinical use. Calibration refers to the agreement between the predicted outcomes (in this case, survival probabilities) and the actual outcomes, with a perfect calibration curve having an intercept of 0 and a slope of 1. A positive intercept indicates that the actual survival is generally underestimated by the prediction model, and a negative intercept suggests the opposite (overestimation). When comparing models, an intercept closer to 0 typically indicates better calibration. Calibration can also be summarized as log(O:E), the logarithm scale of the ratio of observed (O) to expected (E) survivors. A log(O:E) > 0 signals an underestimation (the observed survival is greater than the predicted survival); and a log(O:E) < 0 indicates the opposite (the observed survival is lower than the predicted survival). A model with a log(O:E) closer to 0 is generally considered better calibrated. The Brier score is the mean squared difference between the model predictions and the observed outcomes, and it ranges from 0 (best prediction) to 1 (worst prediction). The Brier score captures both discrimination and calibration, and it is considered a measure of overall model performance. In Brier score analysis, the ""null model"" assigns a predicted probability equal to the prevalence of the outcome and represents a model that adds no new information. A prediction model should achieve a Brier score at least lower than the null-model Brier score to be considered as useful. The DCA was developed as a method to determine whether using a model to inform treatment decisions would do more good than harm. It plots the net benefit of making decisions based on the model's predictions across all possible risk thresholds (or cost-to-benefit ratios) in relation to the two default strategies of treating all or no patients. The care provider can decide on an acceptable risk threshold for the proposed treatment in an individual and assess the corresponding net benefit to determine whether consulting with the model is superior to adopting the default strategies. Finally, we examined whether laboratory data, which were not included in the METSSS model, would have been independently associated with survival after controlling for the METSSS model's predictions by using the multivariable logistic and Cox proportional hazards regression analyses. Between the two models, only SORG-MLA achieved adequate discrimination (an AUROC of > 0.7) in the entire cohort (of patients treated operatively or with radiation alone) and in the subgroup of patients treated with palliative radiotherapy alone. SORG-MLA outperformed METSSS by a wide margin on discrimination, calibration, and Brier score analyses in not only the entire cohort but also the subgroup of patients whose local treatment consisted of radiotherapy alone. In both the entire cohort and the subgroup, DCA demonstrated that SORG-MLA provided more net benefit compared with the two default strategies (of treating all or no patients) and compared with METSSS when risk thresholds ranged from 0.2 to 0.9 at both 90 days and 1 year, indicating that using SORG-MLA as a decision-making aid was beneficial when a patient's individualized risk threshold for opting for treatment was 0.2 to 0.9. Higher albumin, lower alkaline phosphatase, lower calcium, higher hemoglobin, lower international normalized ratio, higher lymphocytes, lower neutrophils, lower neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, lower platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, higher sodium, and lower white blood cells were independently associated with better 1-year and overall survival after adjusting for the predictions made by METSSS. Based on these discoveries, clinicians might choose to consult SORG-MLA instead of METSSS for survival estimation in patients with long-bone metastases presenting for evaluation of local treatment. Basing a treatment decision on the predictions of SORG-MLA could be beneficial when a patient's individualized risk threshold for opting to undergo a particular treatment strategy ranged from 0.2 to 0.9. Future studies might investigate relevant laboratory items when constructing or refining a survival estimation model because these data demonstrated prognostic value independent of the predictions of the METSSS model, and future studies might also seek to keep these models up to date using data from diverse, contemporary patients undergoing both modern operative and nonoperative treatments.

Inflammatory markers (IMs), such as procalcitonin (PCT), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), seem more accurate in diagnosing SSI than C-reactive protein (CRP) and white blood cell (WBC) count. The aim was to compare the predictive values of CRP, WBC count, PCT, IL-6, and TNF-α in SSI detection. A total of 130 patients undergoing dorsal spondylodesis from 2019 to 2024 were enrolled in a prospective diagnostic study at a maximum care spine center. IMs were measured preoperatively and on the postoperative days (PODs) 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7. Patients with high suspicion of SSI underwent revision surgery. SSI was diagnosed when the microbiological evidence was positive. Patients were divided a posteriori into the non-infection and infection groups. IMs of 118 patients (66.9 ± 13.0 years, 61.0% females) were measured. Fifteen of the 118 patients (12.7%) developed an SSI. The groups differed with respect to existing hypertension, number of instrumented segments, region of surgery, CRPPOD1,7, PCTPOD7, and IL-6POD3,5,7. Binary logistic regression for SSI detection including these parameters showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.88 (95% CI 0.79-0.98; P < 0.001). The main effect for SSI detection was maintained by IL-6POD7 (odds ratio = 1.13; 95% CI 1.05-1.23; P = 0.001), which itself showed an AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.75-0.97). Compared to CRP, WBC count, PCT, and TNF-α, IL-6 seems to be the critical IM for the early detection of an SSI. drks.de: DRKS00033773, date of registration: 29.02.2024, retrospectively registered; Postoperative Markers of Inflammation in Spine Surgery (POMIS) Trial.","2024","Infection"

Among 305 adult patients diagnosed with MCD via light and electron microscopy, sensitive to steroids, and hospitalized for nephrotic syndrome in the Department of Nephrology of the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University in China, 88 were included in this retrospective cohort study. Cox regression analysis was performed with time to clinical remission and 24-hour urine protein quantification (24 hUTP), absolute basophil (BA) and basophil percentage (BA%) as independent variables. Independent variables with significant differences and the time to remission were used to construct a Cox regression model to exclude the influence of confounding factors. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was plotted according to the independent variable of time to clinical remission. No significant differences were found between the relapse and non-relapse groups in terms of sex, age at onset, or prevalent hypertension. There were significant differences in time to clinical remission, 24 hUTP, BA and BA% between the relapse and non-relapse groups. The risk of recurrence was significantly higher in patients with clinical remission of 15-21, 22-28 and 29-56 days than in those who had clinical remission of 1-7 days. In addition, patients with clinical remission of >26.5 days had a significantly higher risk of recurrence than those in the other groups.

Patients who underwent resection for CRLM from January 2003-December 2012 at a single institution were included. Patients who did not receive preoperative systemic chemotherapy, or without adequate imaging, were excluded. Imaging characteristics were evaluated based on RECIST 1.1 and CT morphologic criteria. A machine-learning model was designed with radiomic features extracted from manually segmented posttreatment CT tumoral and peritumoral regions to identify pathologic responders (≥ 50% response) versus nonresponders. Statistical analysis was performed at the tumor level. Eighty-five patients (median age, 62 years; 55 women) with 95 tumors were included. None of the subjectively evaluated imaging characteristics were associated with pathologic response (p > 0.05). Inter-reader agreement was substantial for RECIST categorical response assessment (K = 0.70) and moderate for CT morphological group response (K = 0.50). In the validation cohort, the machine learning model built with radiomic features obtained an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.87 and outperformed subjective RECIST assessment (AUC = 0.53, p = 0.01) and morphologic assessment (AUC = 0.56, p = 0.02). Radiologist assessment of oligometastatic CRLM after neoadjuvant therapy using RECIST 1.1 and CT morphologic criteria was not associated with pathologic response.

Thus, the role of M protein in total bilirubin determination was examined in this study. Total bilirubin detection curve difference comparison between monoclonal IgG protein and polyclonal immunoglobulin, interference experiments, and dilution elimination experiments were conducted. These experiments revealed not only a positive correlation between M protein interference in bilirubin detection with its concentration, but also M protein-specific interference distinct from polyclonal immunoglobulin. We employed the R and EmpowerStat statistical systems to evaluate the correlation between serum monoclonal protein and total bilirubin absorbance curve data.

In this study, speech samples of 62 CHR-P individuals and 45 healthy controls (HCs) were elicited using Thematic Apperception Test images. The evaluation involved various NLP measures such as semantic similarity, generic, and part-of-speech (POS) features. The CHR-P group demonstrated higher sentence-level semantic similarity and reduced mean image-to-text similarity. Regarding generic analysis, they demonstrated reduced verbosity and produced shorter sentences with shorter words. The POS analysis revealed a decrease in the utilization of adverbs, conjunctions, and first-person singular pronouns, alongside an increase in the utilization of adjectives in the CHR-P group compared to HC. In addition, we developed a machine-learning model based on 30 NLP-derived features to distinguish between the CHR-P and HC groups. The model demonstrated an accuracy of 79.6 % and an AUC-ROC of 0.86.

We selected target individuals for health guidance without exercise habits in 2017 and assessed whether the participants acquired exercise habits through health guidance in 2018. We applied ten machine learning algorithms to build prediction models for acquiring exercise habits. This study included 16,471 middle-aged Japanese workers (age, 49.5 ± 6.2 years). Among the machine learning algorithms, the Boosted Generalized Linear Model was the best for predicting the acquisition of exercise habits based on the receiver operating characteristic curve on the test set (ROC-AUCtest, 0.68). According to the analyses, the following factors were associated with the acquisition of exercise habits: being in the maintenance or action stage of changing exercise and eating behaviors based on the transtheoretical model; regular physical activity or walking; normal high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; and high alcohol consumption. Our findings can be used to establish an efficient strategy for encouraging individuals to acquire exercise habits through Specific Health Guidance or other health guidance.

The identified articles were subsequently categorized into three distinct outcomes: Prediction of KOA incidence (KOAi), KOA progression (KOAp) and total knee arthroplasty risk (TKAr). Within each category, results were organized by the nature of biomarker(s) used, as either quantitative, semi-quantitative or compound. Due to the lack of predictive metrics such as the area under the ROC curve (AUC) scores, sensitivity or specificity, 27 studies were excluded.

This study included 201 patients from Hospital A who were divided into training set (n = 161) and an internal validation set (n = 40) in an 8:2 ratio. Additionally, 34 patients from Hospital B were included for external validation. US images were delineated using ITK software, and radiomics features were extracted using PyRadiomics software. Subsequently, separate models for clinical factors, radiomics features, and their combinations were constructed. The model's performance was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve and decision curve analysis (DCA). In total, 235 patients diagnosed with CCRCC, comprising 168 low-grade and 67 high-grade tumors, were included in this study. A comparison of the predictive performances of different models revealed that the logistic regression model exhibited relatively good stability and robustness. The AUC of the combined model for the training, internal validation and external validation sets were 0.871, 0.785 and 0.826, respectively, which were higher than those of the clinical and imaging histology models. Furthermore, the calibration curve demonstrated excellent concordance between the predicted Fuhrman grade probability of CCRCC using the combined model and the observed values in both the training and validation sets. Additionally, within the threshold range of 0-0.93, the combined model demonstrated substantial clinical utility, as evidenced by DCA. The application of US radiomics techniques enabled objective prediction of Fuhrman grading in patients with CCRCC. Nevertheless, certain clinical indicators remain indispensable, underscoring the pressing need for their integrated use in clinical practice. Previous studies have predominantly focused on using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging modalities to predict the Fuhrman grade of CCRCC.

There is growing evidence that ferroptosis is involved in the pathogenesis of RA. This study aimed to search for diagnostic markers of ferroptosis in RA and to analyse the potential mechanisms and clinical value. RA-associated datasets were used from the publicly available GEO database. Three methods of machine learning were applied to screen biomarkers. The diagnostic efficacy of the results was also verified by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, external dataset, qRT-PCR and Western blot. Enrichment analysis was performed in this process, while protein-protein interaction (PPI) analysis and immune infiltration correlation analysis were performed using biomarkers, and competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) networks were constructed to search for prospective therapeutic targets. MMP13 and GABARAPL1 can be used as ferroptosis diagnostic genes in RA. The ROC curve and PPI result demonstrated that MMP13 and GABARAPL1 had an excellent diagnostic value. The results of signature genes in the external dataset, qRT-PCR and Western blot further confirm our findings. The enrichment analysis showed that p53, MAPK and NOD-like receptor signalling pathways may be involved in the process of ferroptosis in RA. In addition, two ferroptosis diagnostic genes in RA participate in the occurrence of ferroptosis in RA via oxidative stress, metabolism and immune response. Immune infiltration analysis showed that RA extensively infiltrated B cells, T cells, macrophages and other immune cells. Persistent immune activation may be an essential reason for the progression of ferroptosis in RA. We also obtained five potential therapeutic agents for RA and some long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) regulating ferroptosis diagnostic genes. Our study suggests that MMP13 and GABARAPL1, which are closely linked with oxidative stress and immunological modulation, can be used as ferroptosis-related potential diagnostic markers in RA and provide new clues regarding the diagnostic and therapeutic targets of ferroptosis in RA.","2024","Annals of medicine"

Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) is currently the only blood-based marker in clinical use for disease control monitoring in mCRC. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA), including circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) could become a useful surrogate for oncological outcomes. Forty patients with RAS-/BRAF-mutated mCRC from the prospective NORDIC-VII trial (NCT00145314) were included. An exploratory model system was made to describe the early on-treatment kinetics of CEA, cfDNA and ctDNA during first-line oxaliplatin-based chemotherapy, and investigate the associations with radiological response, progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Summary metrics were made, representing percentage change from treatment start to time-grid day 7 (P7), day 14 (P14), and day 49 (P49); slope from time-grid day 0 to 7 (S7), day 8 to 14 (S14), and day 15 to 49 (S49); and area under the curve from time-grid day 0 to 49 (AUC). Notably P49 and S49 for ctDNA and CEA were associated with radiological response and/or PFS. The early dynamics of the two markers differed substantially, with faster and more marked changes in ctDNA compared with CEA. Nine patients did not reach complete/near complete molecular ctDNA response close to first evaluation (∼week 8), a state associated with a short PFS (HR 2.72; 95% CI, 1.22-6.06; P = .01) and OS (HR 3.12; 95% CI, 1.35-7.23; P < .01).

In this research, a novel approach called AttentionEP for predicting essential proteins (EP) is introduced by attention mechanisms. This method leverages both cross-attention and self-attention frameworks, focusing on enhancing prediction accuracy through the integration of features across diverse scales. Spatial characteristics of proteins are obtained from the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network by employing Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT). Following this, Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory networks (BiLSTM) are employed to derive temporal features from gene expression datasets. Furthermore, spatial characteristics are derived by integrating data on subcellular localization with the application of Deep Neural Networks (DNN). In order to effectively integrate features across multiple scales, initial steps involve the application of self-attention techniques to derive essential insights from each unique data set. Following this, mechanisms involving self-attention and cross-attention are employed to enhance the interaction between diverse information sources. To identify essential proteins, a classifier based on the ResNet architecture is developed. The findings from the experiments indicate that the method introduced here shows superior performance in identifying essential proteins, recording an Area Under the Curve (AUC) value of 0.9433. This approach shows a considerable advantage over established techniques. The findings of this study provide a significant advancement in the comprehension of critical proteins, revealing promising potential for applications in the development of therapeutics and addressing various diseases.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

However, limited training in identification of such calcifications among dental professionals results in missed diagnoses. This study aimed to detect CAC on PRs using an artificial intelligence (AI) model based on a vision transformer. 6,404 PRs were obtained from one hospital and screened for the presence of CAC based on electronic medical records. CAC was manually annotated with bounding boxes by an oral radiologist and reviewed and revised by three experienced clinicians to achieve consensus. An AI approach based on Faster R-CNN and Swin Transformer was trained and evaluated based on 185 PRs with CAC and 185 PRs without CAC. Reported and replicated diagnostic performances of published AI approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) were used for comparison. Quantitative evaluation of the performance of the models included precision, F1-score, recall, area-under-the-curve (AUC), and average precision (AP). The proposed method based on Faster R-CNN and Swin Transformer achieved a precision of 0.895, recall of 0.881, F1-score of 0.888, AUC of 0.950, and AP of 0.942, surpassing models based on a CNN. The detection performance of this newly developed and validated model was improved compared to previously reported models. Integrating AI models into dental imaging to assist dental professionals in the detection of CAC on PRs has the potential to significantly enhance the early detection of carotid artery atherosclerosis and its clinical management.","2024","Journal of dentistry"

We leveraged data on clinical risk factors for childhood obesity during the perinatal period, along with cord blood per/polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) and cord blood DNA methylation, in 268 mother-offspring pairs. We used the sparsity ranked LASSO penalized regression framework for each outcome and assessed model performance based on % variability explained for BMIz and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for the fourth versus first quartile of %FM. We employed cross-validation for model tuning and split-sample validation for model evaluation. Mean ± SD BMIz was 0.01 ± 1.1, %FM was 19.8 ± 6.34%. The optimal model for predicting BMIz explained 19.1% of the variability in the validation set and included only clinical characteristics: maternal pre-pregnancy BMI, paternal BMI, gestational weight gain, physical activity during pregnancy and child race/ethnicity. The optimal model for fourth versus first quartiles of %FM achieved an AUC of 0.82 ± 0.01 in the validation set, with the clinical features again emerging as the strongest predictors. In this study sample, perinatal chemical exposures and the epigenome have low utility in predicting childhood adiposity, beyond known clinical risk factors.","2024","Pediatric obesity"

A total of 110 CHD patients were divided into four groups based on their mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAPm). The plasma miR-3591-5p expression was determined by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The correlation between the miR-3591-5p expression and various clinical indices, as well as its diagnostic value for CHD-PAH patients, were analyzed. The plasma levels of miR-3591-5p were significantly higher in the patients in the no PAH group, mild PAH group, and moderate to severe PAH group than in the control group, and they were significantly higher in the moderate to severe PAH group than in the no PAH group. Correlation analysis revealed that the miR-3591-5p expression level was significantly positively correlated with various clinical indicators, including the PAPm, pulmonary artery systolic pressure, brain natriuretic peptide, pulmonary vascular resistance, red blood cell distribution width, uric acid, Na + , systolic blood pressure, left atrial internal dimension, left ventricular end-diastolic dimension, and left ventricular end-systolic dimension. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses identified the plasma miR-3591-5p level as an independent risk factor for CHD-PAH. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis demonstrated that the plasma miR-3591-5p level had a moderate diagnostic value for CHD-PAH, which was further improved when combined with a B-type natriuretic peptide. This study identified the expression profiles of differentially expressed plasma miRNAs in patients with CHD-PAH, focusing on the upregulation of miR-3591-5p. Bioinformatics analysis suggested that miR-3591-5p is involved in the pathogenesis of CHD-PAH and may serve as a circulating biomarker that may have diagnostic and prognostic value in CHD-PAH.","2024","Lung"

Participants included stroke population who reported on sleep disorder and completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) to assess depressive symptom. Sleep disorder was self-reported and categorized dichotomously. Multivariate logistic regression, subgroup analysis, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and restricted cubic spline (RCS) were used to explore the association between sleep disorder and depression. The final sample included 566 stroke survivors (weighted n = 3,326,625). Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that sleep disorder was independently associated with an increased risk of depression even after adjusting for potential confounders (OR = 2.616, 95 % CI: 2.561 to 2.599, P < 0.0001). Subgroup analysis indicated that this association was particularly strong among female stroke population (OR = 5.515). Sleep disorder as a significant predictor of depression, while the relationship between sleep time and depression is characterized by non-linearity. Sleep disorder is significantly associated with an increased risk of depression in stroke. This relationship remains robust across various sociodemographic and lifestyle factors, highlighting the need for integrated interventions targeting both sleep and mood disturbances in stroke care.","2024","Sleep medicine"

Studies indicate that circulating cell-free mitochondrial DNA (ccf-mtDNA) can activate the immune system and is associated with neurodegenerative diseases. This research was designed to quantify ccf-mtDNA levels in the serum of ALS patients. The medical records of ALS patients were reviewed. Serum ccf-mtDNA levels of patients with ALS (n = 62) and age-matched healthy controls (n = 46) were measured and compared. Additionally, serum interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels were measured using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in 26 ALS patients. Correlations between variables were analyzed. Serum ccf-mtDNA was notably higher in the patients with ALS. When stratified by genotype, the superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1) mutation group showed the greatest increase in ccf-mtDNA levels relative to other ALS patients. Among all 108 individuals, a cut-off set at 1.1 × 105 mtDNA copies on a receiver-operating characteristic curve identified patients with ALS with 80.7% sensitivity and 50.0% specificity; the area under the curve was 0.69 (p < 0.001). Furthermore, serum ccf-mtDNA levels correlated negatively with the progression rate of ALS (ΔFS; rs = -0.26, p = 0.044), but not the ALSFRS-R score (rs = 0.06, p = 0.625). Importantly, the correlation between ccf-mtDNA and ΔFS was more pronounced in the SOD1 mutation group (rs = -0.62, p = 0.018). Lastly, a significant positive association was observed between serum ccf-mtDNA levels and IL-6 levels in ALS (r s= 0.41, p = 0.038). Our study found increased serum ccf-mtDNA in ALS patients, suggesting a link to inflammatory processes and disease mechanism. Moreover, ccf-mtDNA could be an indicator for ALS progression, especially in those with the SOD1 mutation.","2024","European journal of neurology"

A single-centre retrospective study included 316 patients who underwent RC between 2010 and 2019. A competing risk Cox model, whereby death from any cause was treated as a censoring event, was used to establish nomograms to analyze the prognostic factors for CKD at 2 and 5 years. The nomograms were validated based on discrimination using the C-index, calibration plots and analysis of net benefit from decision curves. During a median follow-up of 48.73 months (0.13-156.67), 138 patients (43.7%) developed CKD. The probability of CKD development at 2 and 5 years was 41.3% (95% CI, 35.8-47.2) and 48.5% (95% CI, 42.8-54.6), respectively. Hypertension (HR 1.69, 95% CI, 1.23-2.34), prior hydronephrosis (HR 1.62, 95% CI, 1.17-2.25), acute kidney injury (AKI) during the immediate postoperative period (HR 1.88, 95% CI, 1.35-2.61) and readmission due to urinary tract infection (HR 1.41, 95% CI, 1.01-1.96) were predictors of 2-year CKD. Hydronephrosis at follow-up computed tomography (HR 2.21, 95% CI, 1.60-3.07), prior hydronephrosis (HR 1.54, 95% CI, 1.09-2.15), AKI during the immediate postoperative period (HR 1.77, 95% CI, 1.27-2.46) and hypertension (HR 1.60, 95% CI, 1.16-2.21) were predictors for 5-year CKD. Prior eGFR ≥ 90 mL/min/1.73 m2 was a protective factor (HR 0.50, 95% CI, 0.32-0.80 and HR 0.48, 95% CI, 0.30-0.78 for 2- and 5-year CKD, respectively). The resulting nomograms were based on these prognostic factors. Almost half of the patients had developed CKD at 5 years. Thus, it is crucial to identify patients at risk of developing CKD in order to initiate renal function-sparing measures and tailor follow-up protocols. The proposed nomograms effectively predicted CKD in these patients.","2024","Clinical genitourinary cancer"

Six hundred forty-seven participants (mean 8.1, standard deviation 3.4 years' follow-up) had the following baseline procedures: modified Blessed Information Memory Concentration Test (BIMCT), 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (BSIT), structural brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), and positron emission tomography (PET) imaging with 11C-Pittsburgh compound B (11C-PiB) and fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG; subset). Cognitive decline developed in 102 participants and dementia in 34 participants. In survival analyses, PiB PET showed robust prediction for cognitive decline. Impaired BSIT, impaired BIMCT, MRI, and FDG measures were also significant predictors. The combination of demographics + BSIT + BIMCT showed strong predictive utility (C-index 0.81), similar to demographics + PiB PET (C-index 0.80). Similar but stronger results were obtained for prediction of dementia. Impairment in both odor identification test and global cognition was comparable to PiB PET for predicting cognitive decline and dementia. In 647 participants in the population-based Mayo Clinic Study of Aging, several clinical markers and biomarkers each predicted cognitive decline or dementia during an average 8 years of follow-up. The combination of the demographic variables of age, sex, and education with a brief odor identification test (BSIT) and a global cognitive test (Blessed Information Memory Concentration Test) showed strong predictive utility (C-index 0.81) for cognitive decline that was similar to the demographic variables combined with Pittsburgh Compound B amyloid imaging (C-index 0.80). Combining a brief odor identification test with a brief cognitive test needs consideration as a simple, cost-effective option in the clinical assessment of individuals at risk of cognitive decline and dementia, as well as a potential tool to identify individuals who may benefit from disease-modifying treatments and to screen participants for prevention trials.","2024","Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association"

Therefore, in this study, we aimed to examine the long-term prognosis and 10-year survival rates and analyze poor prognostic factors in patients who underwent resection of pulmonary metastases from CRC. This retrospective, single-institution study included 156 patients with controlled primary CRC and metastases confined to the lungs or liver who underwent pulmonary metastasectomy between 2005 and 2022. Statistical analyses were conducted using the X2 and two-tailed Student's t test to compare variables. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the appropriate cut-off point for tumor size as a predictive factor of survival. Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and non-parametric group comparisons were performed using log-rank tests. The 5- and 10-year OS rates were 67% and 59%, respectively. Further, there was no recurrence 38 months post-surgery, and the RFS curve plateaued. Moreover, by 88 months post-surgery, no deaths occurred, and the OS curve plateaued. Multivariate analysis revealed that a pulmonary metastatic tumor >14 mm and disease-free interval <2 years indicated poor prognosis. The RFS curve for pulmonary metastasectomy may plateau approximately 3 years after surgery. Pulmonary metastasectomy can achieve long-term survival in selected patients with CRC. Furthermore, surgical resection of recurrence after pulmonary metastasectomy may lead to better results. Thus, tumor size and disease-free interval may be independent prognostic factors.","2024","Updates in surgery"

This cross-sectional study was conducted among 7701 participants with MAFLD from August 2018 to December 2023. All participants were divided into a training cohort and a validation cohort. The study compared different subgroups' demographic, anthropometric, and laboratory examination indicators and conducted logistic regression analysis to assess the correlation between independent variables and liver fibrosis. Nomograms were created using the logistic regression model. The predictive values of noninvasive models and nomograms were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA). Four nomograms were developed for the quantitative analysis of significant liver fibrosis risk based on the multivariate logistic regression analysis results. The nomogram's area under ROC curves (AUC) was 0.710, 0.714, 0.748, and 0.715 in overall MAFLD, OW-MAFLD, Lean-MAFLD, and T2DM-MAFLD, respectively. The nomogram had a higher AUC in all MAFLD participants and OW-MAFLD than the other non-invasive scores. The DCA curve showed that the net benefit of each nomogram was higher than that of APRI and FIB-4. In the validation cohort, the AUCs of the nomograms were 0.722, 0.750, 0.719, and 0.705, respectively. APRI, FIB-4, and NFS performed poorly predicting significant fibrosis in patients with MAFLD.

Data sources: The PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) databases were searched to identify studies published from January 2003 to November 2023. Study selection: Clinical studies examining sublingual microcirculation and the prognosis of sepsis were included. Data extraction: Sublingual microcirculation indices included the microvascular blood index (MFI), total vascular density (TVD), perfusion vascular density (PVD), perfusion vascular vessel (PPV), and heterogeneity index (HI). Prognostic outcomes included mortality and severity. Funnel plots and Egger's test were used to detect publication bias. The ability of the small vessel PPV (PPVs) to predict sepsis-related mortality was analyzed based on the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve, pooled sensitivity, and pooled specificity. Data synthesis: Twenty-five studies involving 1750 subjects were included. The TVD (95% CI 0.11-0.39), PVD (95% CI 0.42-0.88), PPV (95% CI 6.63-13.83), and MFI (95% CI 0.13-0.6) of the survival group were greater than those of the nonsurvival group. The HI in the survival group was lower than that in the nonsurvival group (95% CI -0.49 to -0.03). The TVD (95% CI 0.41-0.83), PVD (95% CI 0.83-1.17), PPV (95% CI 14.49-24.9), and MFI (95% CI 0.25-0.66) of the nonsevere group were greater than those of the severe group. Subgroup analysis revealed no significant difference in TVD between the survival group and the nonsurvival group in the small vessel subgroup. The area under the SROC curve (AUC) was 0.88. Conclusions: Sublingual microcirculation was worse among patients who died and patients with severe sepsis than among patients who survived and patients with nonsevere sepsis.

We proposed a multitask learning network MCSNetatt which efficiently introduces segmentation prior features and enhances classification results through multiscale feature fusion and spatial attention modules. The MRI studies and subsequent arthroscopic diagnosis of 259 knees were collected retrospectively. Models were trained based on multitask loss with coronal and sagittal sequences and fused using logistic regression (LR). We visualized the network's interpretability by the gradient-weighted class activation mapping method. The LR model achieved higher area under the curve and mean average precision of medial and lateral menisci than models trained on a single sagittal or coronal sequence. Our multitask model MCSNetat outperformed the single-task model CNet and two clinicians in classification, with accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score of 0.980, 1.000, 0.952, 0.976 for medial and 0.920, 0.905, 0.905, 0.905 for the lateral, respectively.

Furthermore, we explore whether other clinical or echocardiographic features could improve its performance. A cohort of randomly selected individuals ≥ 65 years from a primary care population of Barcelona without established cardiovascular disease included 791 patients (63.1% female, median age 76 years, median follow-up 11.8 years). The model's performance yielded a Harrell's C-statistic of 0.706 (95% CI 0.659-0.753) for the primary endpoint (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular mortality) and 0.692 (95% CI 0.649-0.734) for the secondary endpoint (primary endpoint plus heart failure hospitalization), with better discrimination in females. SCORE2-OP underestimated the risk of primary endpoint in women (Expected[E]/Observed[O]=0.77), slightly overestimated in men (E/O=1.06), and systematically underestimated the risk of the secondary endpoint (E/O=0.52).

We also explored whether heart rate (HR) and/or HRV could be used to distinguish older adults who achieved elevated thermal strain, defined as either (1) an increase in core temperature >1.0 °C (occurring in 39%, 15/39) or (2) a reduction in systolic blood pressure >10 mm Hg (occurring in 67%, 26/39). Percentage of age-predicted maximal HR and percentage of heart rate reserve (HRR) were higher, whereas standard deviation of normal RR intervals, the square root of the mean of squared differences between successive RR intervals (RMSSD), high frequency power (HF), and cardiac vagal index (CVI) were lower in older compared to young adults during heat exposure (P ≤ 0.004). In older adults, increases in core temperature were correlated with percentage of age-predicted maximal HR, percentage of HRR, RMSSD, and CVI (P ≤ 0.031), whereas changes in systolic blood pressure were not significantly associated with HR or HRV indices (P ≥ 0.327). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that HR and HRV indices had generally poor ability to identify older adults with elevated thermal strain (area under the curve ≤0.65). Age-related differences in HRV, consistent with vagal withdrawal among older adults, remained during daylong heat exposure, but marked heterogeneity of response likely contributed to HRV providing limited discriminatory value in identifying changes in core temperature or blood pressure in older adults.","2024","Applied physiology, nutrition, and metabolism = Physiologie appliquee, nutrition et metabolisme"

From 7764 identified records, 100 prediction models were included (88% diagnostic, 5% prognostic, and 7% treatment-response). Of these, 96% and 7% were internally and externally validated, respectively. None was implemented in clinical practice. Only 8% of the models were deemed at low risk of bias; 67% were considered at high risk of bias.

The performance of ADHD prediction models was increased in those models including, compared to those models not including, clinical predictors (β = 6.54, p = 0.007). Type of validation, age range, type of model, number of predictors, study quality, and other type of predictors did not alter the AUC. Several prediction models have been developed to support the diagnosis of ADHD. However, efforts to predict outcomes or treatment response have been limited, and none of the available models is ready for implementation into clinical practice. The use of clinical predictors, which may be combined with other type of predictors, seems to improve the performance of the models.

This retrospective study analyzed 123 patients who underwent multiparametric prostate MRI followed by systematic and targeted biopsies. MRI protocols adhered to international guidelines and included T2-weighted, diffusion-weighted, T1-weighted, and dynamic contrast-enhanced imaging. The AI software tool mdprostate was integrated into the Picture Archiving and Communication System to automatically segment the prostate, calculate prostate volume, and classify lesions according to PI-RADS scores using biparametric T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted imaging. Histopathological analysis of biopsy cores served as the reference standard. Diagnostic performance metrics including sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive value (PPV, NPV), and area under the ROC curve (AUC) were calculated. mdprostate demonstrated 100 % sensitivity at a PI-RADS ≥ 2 cutoff, effectively ruling out both clinically significant and non-significant prostate cancers for lesions remaining below this threshold. For detecting clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) using a PI-RADS ≥ 4 cutoff, mdprostate achieved a sensitivity of 85.5 % and a specificity of 63.2 %. The AUC for detecting cancers of any grade was 0.803. The performance metrics of mdprostate were comparable to those reported in two meta-analyses of PI-RADS v2.1, with no significant differences in sensitivity and specificity (p > 0.05). The evaluated AI tool demonstrated high diagnostic performance in identifying and grading prostate lesions, with results comparable to those reported in meta-analyses of expert readers using PI-RADS v2.1. Its ability to standardize evaluations and potentially reduce variability underscores its potential as a valuable adjunct in the prostate cancer diagnostic pathway. The high accuracy of mdprostate, particularly in ruling out prostate cancers, highlights its clinical utility by reducing workload and enhancing patient outcomes.","2024","European journal of radiology"

Methods: This is a cross-sectional, population-based study comprising 1384 adults living in Jianchuan county, China, which has an average altitude of over 2200 m. Logistic regressions were used to examine the associations between TyG, TyG-BMI, and NAFLD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were utilized to compare the predictive ability of TyG, TyG-BMI, hepatic steatosis index (HSI), and triglyceride glucose-alanine aminotransferase (TyG-ALT). Results: In total, 307 (35.7%) male and 81 (15.4%) female participants were diagnosed with NAFLD. Individuals with NAFLD had higher BMI, blood pressure, and TyG indices. The adjusted odds ratios (95% confidence intervals) for the highest quartile of TyG and TyG-BMI were 16.04 (8.51-30.25) and 48.55 (25.12-93.81), respectively. The areas under the ROC curve were 0.811 (95% CI: 0.787-0.836) for TyG, 0.883 (95% CI: 0.864-0.902) for TyG-BMI, 0.839 (95% CI: 0.817-0.863) for HSI, and 0.831 (95% CI: 0.801-0.855) for TyG-ALT. Tyg-BMI had the highest sensitivity (0.832) and specificity (0.780) compared to the other indices. Conclusions: Both TyG and TyG-BMI were associated with higher NAFLD risk in people living in high-altitude regions, while TyG-BMI had greater predictive capabilities.","2024","Journal of clinical medicine"

Early diagnosis is crucial to prevent irreversible damage, yet it remains a challenge due to nonspecific symptoms that often appear later in the disease progression. A retrospective study analyzed data collected from 133 AL amyloidosis patients and 271 non-AL patients with similar symptoms but different diagnoses between January 1st, 2017, and September 30th, 2022. Demographic data and laboratory test results were collected. Subsequently, significant features were identified by both logistic regression and independent expert clinical ability. Eventually, logistic regression and four machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to construct a diagnostic model, utilizing fivefold cross-validation and blind set testing to identify the optimal model. The study successfully identified nine independent predictors of AL amyloidosis patients with kidney or cardiac involvement, respectively. Two models were developed to identify key features that distinguish AL amyloidosis from nephrotic syndrome and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, respectively. The light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM) model emerged as the most effective, demonstrating superior performance with the area under curve (AUC) of 0.90 in both models, alongside high sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score. This research highlights the potential of using a machine learning-based LightGBM model to facilitate early and accurate diagnosis of AL amyloidosis. The model's effectiveness suggests it could be a valuable tool in clinical settings, aiding in the timely identification of AL amyloidosis among patients with non-specific symptoms. Further validation in diverse populations is recommended to establish its universal applicability.","2024","Annals of hematology"

Two hundred and twelve patients with pathologically confirmed colorectal cancer were divided into a training set (n = 148) and a validation set (n = 64). Radiomics features from the most recent CT scans and clinical data obtained before surgery were extracted. Random forest models were trained to predict tumors with clinical data and evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and other metrics on the validation set. Fourteen features were selected to establish the radiomics model, which yielded an AUC of 0.751 for the training set and an AUC of 0.714 for the test set. The fusion model, based on a combination of the radiomics signature and clinical data, showed good performance in both the training set (AUC 0.952) and the test set (AUC 0.761). We have developed a fusion model that integrates radiomics features with clinical data. This fusion model could serve as a non-invasive, reliable, and accurate tool for the preoperative prediction of liver metastases after surgery for colorectal cancer. Question Can a radiomics and clinical fusion model improve the prediction of liver metastases in colorectal cancer and help optimize clinical decision-making? Findings The presented fusion model combining CT radiomics and clinical data showed superior accuracy in predicting colorectal cancer liver metastases compared to single models.

To investigate the role of total and specific immunoglobulin E (tIgE/sIgE) for defining and predicting T2-high asthma in childhood as biomarkers of ""allergy-driven"". We utilized data from the COPSAC2000 (n = 411) and COPSAC2010 (n = 700) mother-child cohorts with repeated measurements of tIgE, sIgE, b-eos and FeNO through childhood. We defined T2-high asthma by elevated b-eos (≥0.3 × 109/L) and/or FeNO (≥20 ppb) and analyzed association with elevated tIgE (age-specific cut-offs) and sIgE (≥0.35 kU/L) using logistic regression at ages 7/10/13/18 years. Further, we analyzed the association between elevated tIgE and sIgE at age 0-4 years and later risk of T2-high asthma using logistic regression and ROC models. Elevated tIgE was associated with risk of T2-high asthma at all time points, whereas elevated sIgE showed similar results at ages 10/13/18 years. There was no overall model fit preference for a combination of tIgE and sIgE instead of tIgE or sIgE alone using Vuong's Likelihood-Ratio-Test, Akaike or Bayesian Information Criterion. Further, elevated tIgE at age 0-4 years was associated with later risk of T2-high asthma at all time points (AUC = 0.63-0.70, sensitivity = 0.62-0.81, specificity = 0.57-0.78), whereas elevated sIgE at 0-4 years was only associated with T2-high asthma at 18 years (AUC = 0.66, sensitivity = 0.45, specificity = 0.88). There were no significant differences in AUC values between tIgE and sIgE (DeLong's test).

A total of 35 consecutive patients diagnosed with PDAC, proceeding with contrast-enhanced abdominal CT scans, were enrolled in this study. The arterial and portal venous phase images were reconstructed using AiCE and AIDR 3D. The corresponding BBCT images were established as AiCE-BBCT and AIDR 3D-BBCT, respectively. Two observers scored the image quality independently. Cohen's kappa (k) value or intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was used to analyze consistency. The diagnostic performance of four algorithms in detecting vascular invasion in PDAC patients was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC). The AiCE and AiCE-BBCT groups demonstrated superior image noise and diagnostic acceptability compared with AIDR 3D and AIDR 3D-BBCT groups (all p < 0.001), and the k value was 0.861-0.967 for both reviewers. In terms of diagnostic capability for vascular invasion in PDAC, the AiCE-BBCT group exhibited higher specificity (95.0%) and sensitivity (93.3%) compared to the AIDR 3D and AIDR 3D-BBCT groups, with an AUC of 0.942 (95% CI: 0.849-1.000, p < 0.05). Furthermore, all vascular evaluations conducted using AiCE-BBCT demonstrated better consistency (ICC: 0.847-0.935). The BBCT technique in conjunction with AiCE could lead to notable enhancements in both the image quality of PDAC images and the diagnostic performance for tumor vascular invasion. Better diagnostic accuracy of vascular invasion of PDAC based on BBCT in combination with an AiCE is a critical factor in determining treatment strategies and patient outcomes. Identifying vascular invasion of PDAC is important for prognostication. Combined images provide improved image quality and higher diagnostic accuracy.

Principal component analysis (PCA) captured 90% of the variance in metabolites. These principal components (PCs) were added to the Cox models, with the first PC selected to evaluate model performance using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. During a median follow-up of 13.69 years, 5199 (2.16%) participants developed AMD. After accounting for demographic, lifestyle, multimorbidity, socioeconomic factors, and genetic predispositions to AMD, 42 metabolites were associated with AMD incidence. Very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)-related particles, low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-related particles, three additional lipids particles, and albumin were associated with decreased AMD incidence, whereas glucose increased the risk of AMD incidence. Compared to those in the lowest quartile, individuals in the highest quartile of protective metabolite scores exhibited lower risk of AMD incidence (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.869, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.803-0.940, false discovery rate [FDR]-adjusted P = 1.44 × 10-3). However, the AMD-associated metabolites did not enhance predictive performance (both areas under the curve [AUC] = 0.776). Our findings reveal significant associations between specific metabolites and AMD incidence, highlighting the roles of lipoprotein subclasses, cholesterol subtypes, apolipoproteins, glucose, and albumin.

This study explored the integration of clinical parameters and MRI-based DL to enhance diagnostic accuracy for csPCa on MRI. We retrospectively analyzed 932 biparametric prostate MRI examinations performed for suspected csPCa (ISUP ≥2) at 2 institutions. Each MRI scan was automatically analyzed by a previously developed DL model to detect and segment csPCa lesions. Three sets of features were extracted: DL lesion suspicion levels, clinical parameters (prostate-specific antigen, prostate volume, age), and MRI-based lesion volumes for all DL-detected lesions. Six multimodal artificial intelligence (AI) classifiers were trained for each combination of feature sets, employing both early (feature-level) and late (decision-level) information fusion methods. The diagnostic performance of each model was tested internally on 20% of center 1 data and externally on center 2 data (n = 529). Receiver operating characteristic comparisons determined the optimal feature combination and information fusion method and assessed the benefit of multimodal versus unimodal analysis. The optimal model performance was compared with a radiologist using PI-RADS. Internally, the multimodal AI integrating DL suspicion levels with clinical features via early fusion achieved the highest performance. Externally, it surpassed baselines using clinical parameters (0.77 vs 0.67 area under the curve [AUC], P < 0.001) and DL suspicion levels alone (AUC: 0.77 vs 0.70, P = 0.006). Early fusion outperformed late fusion in external data (0.77 vs 0.73 AUC, P = 0.005). No significant performance gaps were observed between multimodal AI and radiologist assessments (internal: 0.87 vs 0.88 AUC; external: 0.77 vs 0.75 AUC, both P > 0.05). Multimodal AI (combining DL suspicion levels and clinical parameters) outperforms clinical and MRI-only AI for csPCa detection.

Patients with CT confirmed bronchiectasis identified between 2011 and 2020, residing in the Top End of the NT were eligible to be enrolled. The primary endpoint of 4-year mortality was assessed via hospital records, and sensitivity and specificity of the BSI and FACED assessed against this using area under the curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristics analysis. For patients with missing data, a relative BSI / FACED score was used which divided the score recorded for that patient by the total potential score based on their available clinical data. A total of 456 adult Aboriginal Australian patients >18 years of age were included (55.5% female, median age 49 years). According to the BSI score 43.4% of patients were assessed to have mild, 30.5% moderate and 26.1% severe bronchiectasis (median score 4 (IQR 2, 8)). According to the FACED 80.9% were assessed to have mild, 17.8% moderate and 1.3% severe (median score of 1 (IQR 0, 2)). Four-year mortality was 11.2% (median age of death 55.6 years). Sensitivity and specificity of the BSI combining moderate and severe were 86.3 and 47.2% respectively, and for severe alone 51% and 77%. Sensitivity and specificity of the FACED combining moderate and severe were 21.6% and 81.2%, respectively, and for severe alone 2% and 98.8%. The AUC for the continuous total BSI was 0.703, and the FACED 0.515. Utilising a relative score, based only on data available for patients with missing data (ie lung function or BMI) resulted in slightly improved AUCs for both the BSI (0.717) and FACED (0.571).

We conducted a single-center, retrospective study of 52 MMC infants treated between April 2006 and July 2023. Infants were classified as non-CM-II or CM-II based on the presence of cerebellar displacement. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) at 0 months of age. Volumetric parameters included intracranial volume (ICV), lateral ventricles volume (LVV), posterior cranial fossa volume (PCFV), cerebellum volume (CBMV), and brainstem volume (BSV). LVV represented supratentorial structures, while PCFV, CBMV, and BSV represented infratentorial structures. CM-II was diagnosed in 30 infants (57.7%). Correlation analysis revealed significant negative correlations between supratentorial (LVV) and infratentorial volumes (PCFV, CBMV, and BSV), and positive correlations among volumes within the same space(e.g., PCFV, CBMV, and BSV). CM-II infants exhibited significantly larger ICV (p = 0.04) and LVV (p < 0.001), but smaller PCFV (p < 0.001) and CBMV (p < 0.001) than non-CM-II infants. LVV was the best predictor for distinguishing non-CM-II from CM-II (area under the curve = 0.91). This study identified positive correlations within the same space and negative correlations between supratentorial and infratentorial volumes. LVV emerged as a critical indicator of CM-II, reflecting the relationship between reduced infratentorial space and enlarged supratentorial ventricles (hydrocephalus).

The proposed model has three compelling characteristics. First, we employ a dedicated embedding strategy for CPET data to map raw inputs into the learned embedding space, facilitating the detection of latent features of physiological variables. Second, we devise a novel multi-dimensional feature extraction module to capture rich features of physiological inputs at different dimensions, which consists of a one-dimensional feature extraction branch unfolding both temporal and spatial patterns of the entire data, and a two-dimensional feature extraction branch based on Gramian Angular Field (GAF) encoding to reveal the complicated temporal correlation relationships between time points within a variable. Third, we integrate these techniques with clinically significant demographic information to establish our MDMNet incorporating multi-dimensional with multi-modal learning, thereby further addressing the issues of complex intra-variable associations and inter-individual variability simultaneously. We evaluated the proposed method on the publicly available CPET dataset, achieving AUC scores of 0.948, 0.949 and 0.931 for three tasks respectively.

Of 23,905 eligible patients, 21,703 with discharge status recorded were included in the analysis, representing a post-operative mortality rate of 3.1% (671 mortality events). The candidate algorithm with the best cross-validated performance was an extreme gradient boosting model. The cross-validated AUC was 0.945 (95% CI 0.936 to 0.954) and cross-validated calibration slope and intercept were 1.01 (95% CI 0.96 to 1.06) and 0.05 (95% CI -0.10 to 0.21). For Super Learner models trained on all but one site and evaluated in the holdout site for sites with at least 25 mortality events, overall external validation AUC was 0.864 (95% CI 0.846 to 0.882) with calibration slope and intercept of 1.03 (95% CI 0.97 to 1.09) and 1.18 (95% CI 0.98 to 1.39). The KidsOR post-operative mortality risk algorithm had outstanding cross-validated discrimination and strong cross-validated calibration. Across all external validation sites, discrimination of Super Learner models trained on the remaining sites was excellent, though re-calibration may be necessary prior to use at new sites. This model has the potential to inform clinical practice and guide resource allocation at KidsOR sites world-wide. Observational Study, Level III.","2024","Journal of pediatric surgery"

The revised core nursing outcomes contained 14 items in the ""Physiologic Health,"" ""Psychosocial Health,"" ""Health Knowledge & Behavior,"" and ""Perceived Health"", while the QoL was assessed using the Chinese version of the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck. Potential predictors of QoL were explored using logistic regression analysis, and odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was applied as effect estimates. A prediction model was constructed to predict QoL using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the predictive value was assessed using the area under the ROC curve (AUC). Of the 331 included patients, 137 had a poor QoL. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, we noted female sex (OR: 10.91; 95%CI: 1.24-96.14; P = 0.031), and alcohol consumption (OR: 4.55; 95%CI: 1.32-14.29; P = 0.017) were associated with an elevated incidence of poor QoL, while age 50.0-65.0 years (OR: 0.02; 95%CI: 0.00-0.15; P < 0.001), junior high school as the highest level of schooling (OR: 0.10; 95%CI: 0.03-0.33; P < 0.001), living in cities and towns (OR: 0.07; 95%CI: 0.02-0.37; P = 0.002), and partial laryngectomy (OR: 0.10; 95%CI: 0.03-0.41; P = 0.001) were associated with a lower incidence of poor QoL. Moreover, Physiologic Health score (OR: 1.16; 95%CI: 1.06-1.27; P = 0.001), Psychosocial Health score (OR: 0.48; 95%CI: 0.39-0.58; P < 0.001), Health Knowledge & Behavior score (OR: 0.92; 95%CI: 0.86-0.97; P = 0.006), and Perceived Health score (OR: 0.36; 95%CI: 0.25-0.52; P < 0.001) were associated with the incidence of QoL in LC patients. The constructed prediction model based on these factors had an AUC for predicting QoL of 0.96 (95% CI: 0.94-0.98). This study found age, sex, educational status, residential location, alcohol consumption, surgical approach, and the revised core nursing outcomes are significantly associated with QoL in LC patients. The predictive value of the constructed model was high, which suggesting the clinical nurses should pay attention to the evaluation of postoperative care outcomes in order to enhance QoL.","2024","BMC nursing"

However, small single-centre studies and lack of external validation hinder definitive conclusions on the potential of PSMA PET radiomics in the initial workup of PCa. We aimed to validate a radiomics signature in a larger internal cohort and in an external cohort from a separate centre. Methods: One hundred and twenty-seven PCa patients were retrospectively enrolled across two independent hospitals. The first centre (IRCCS San Raffaele Scientific Institute, Centre 1) contributed 62 [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET scans, 20 patients classified as low-grade (ISUP grade < 4), and 42 as high-grade (ISUP grade ≥ 4). The second centre (Stanford University Hospital, Centre 2) provided 65 [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET scans, and 49 low-grade and 16 high-grade patients. A radiomics model previously generated in Centre 1 was tested on the two cohorts separately and afterward on the entire dataset. Then, we evaluated whether the radiomics features selected in the previous investigation could generalise to new data. Several machine learning (ML) models underwent training and testing using 100-fold Monte Carlo cross-validation, independently at both Centre 1 and Centre 2, with a 70-30% train-test split. Additionally, models were trained in one centre and tested in the other, and vice versa. Furthermore, data from both centres were combined for training and testing using Monte Carlo cross-validation. Finally, a new radiomics signature built on this bicentric dataset was proposed. Several performance metrics were computed. Results: The previously generated radiomics signature resulted in an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 80.4% when tested on Centre 1, while it generalised poorly to Centre 2, where it reached an AUC of 62.7%. When the whole cohort was considered, AUC was 72.5%. Similarly, new ML models trained on the previously selected features yielded, at best, an AUC of 80.9% for Centre 1 and performed at chance for Centre 2 (AUC of 49.3%). A new signature built on this bicentric dataset reached, at best, an average AUC of 91.4% in the test set. Conclusions: The satisfying performance of radiomics models when used in the original development settings, paired with the poor performance otherwise observed, emphasises the need to consider centre-specific factors and dataset characteristics when developing radiomics models. Combining radiomics datasets is a viable strategy to reduce such centre-specific biases, but external validation is still needed.","2024","Cancers"

We retrospectively reviewed patients who underwent major head and neck surgery between 2012 and 2015. Modified Surgical Apgar, and Frailty Index, scores were calculated on 723 patients. The primary outcome was 30-day complication and/or mortality. The mean Modified Frailty Index was 0.11 ± 0.12, and mean Modified Surgical Apgar score was 6.15 ± 1.67. Both scores were significantly associated with 30-day complication (P<0.05). The Modified Surgical Apgar score was superior to the Modified Frailty Index in predicting complications (Area Under the Curve (AUC) = 0.76; 95 % Confidence Interval (CI), 0.722-0.793; and AUC=0.59; 95 % CI, 0.548-0.633, respectively). Concurrent use of both scoring systems (AUC=0.77) was not superior to individual use. An increase in the mFI from 0.27 to 0.36 was associated with an increase in the risk of complication postoperatively (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.67; 95 % CI, 1.30-10.34, P=.014). A reduction in the mSAS from 7 to 6 increased the risk of complication following surgery (OR=2.64; 95 % CI, 1.45-4.80; P=.002). Both scores are useful in risk stratifying head and neck cancer patients.

Then we have utilized the important features identified by those machines learning methods to construct a new model named NKECLR to forecast mortality of patient with cancer. To explicitly clarify the model's decision-making process and uncover novel findings, an interpretable technique incorporating machine learning and SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), as well as LIME, has been employed, and four genes EPGN, PHF11, RBM34, and ZFP36 were identified from those machine learning(ML). The experimental analysis conducted on training and validation datasets demonstrated that the proposed model has a good performance com- pared to existing methods with AUC value 81.8%, and 79.3%, respectively. Moreover, when combined our NKECLR with PD-L1, PD-1, and CTLA-4 the AUC value was 83%0. Finally, these findings have been applied to comprehend the response of drugs and immunotherapy. Our research introduced an innovative predictive NKECLR model utilizing natural killer(NK) cell marker genes for cohorts with melanoma cancer.

A gender-specific analysis.","The accurate and timely diagnosis of periprosthetic joint infection (PJI) is critical for guiding optimal treatment management and success, highlighting the requirement of readily available inexpensive serum biomarkers to increase the diagnostic accuracy for PJI. Many studies have investigated the diagnostic accuracy of neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and monocyte to lymphocyte ratio (MLR). However, there is a lack of existing literature regarding optimal thresholds for acute PJI. The purpose of this study was to reveal the most appropriate cut-off values for MLR and NLR in detecting acute PJI with a gender specific analysis. Patients were classified as having an acute PJI if they met the International Consensus Meeting (ICM) 2018 modified criteria. Patients who had a negative clinical and diagnostic workup for a PJI and the presence of erythema on the index surgical area were included in the erysipelas group (control group). Data obtained from all patients included age, sex, body mass index (BMI), Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI), procedure type (THA or TKA), serum C-reactive protein (CRP), and blood studies at the admission and culture results were retrieved from the electronic medical record. ROC curve analysis was used to determine the gender-specific optimal threshold values for CRP, NLR, and MLR. Comparing the sensitivities and specificities of NLR and MLR at the identified best thresholds in males and females, the study found similar sensitivities of NLR in males and females with 0.84 and 0.84, respectively. On the other hand, an MLR of 0.67 or more reported a notably higher specificity in male patients [0.90 (95% CI 0.75-0.96) versus 0.70 (95% CI 0.56-0.80)]. NLR and MLR represent commonly ordered, low-cost, simple, and readily available complete cell count laboratory values and should be used as adjunct tests with reasonable diagnostic accuracy in detecting acute PJIs. Moreover, with its excellent specificity and PPV, MLR could provide valuable insight in diagnosing acute PJI, particularly in male patients.

Addressing the risk of early treatment interruption is crucial in tuberculosis care and management to improve treatment outcomes and curb disease transmission. This study aimed to identify risk factors of TB treatment interruption and construct a predictive scoring model that enables objective risk stratification for better prediction of treatment interruption. A multicentre retrospective cohort study was conducted at public health clinics in Sarawak, Malaysia over 11 months from March 2022 to January 2023, involving adult patients aged ≥18 years with drug-susceptible TB diagnosed between 2018 and 2021. Cumulative missed doses or discontinuation of TB medications for ≥2 weeks, either consecutive or non-consecutive, was considered as treatment interruption. The model was developed and internally validated using the split-sample method. Multiple logistic regression analysed 18 pre-defined variables to identify the predictors of TB treatment interruption. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were employed to evaluate model performance. Of 2953 cases, two-thirds (1969) were assigned to the derivation cohort, and one-third (984) formed the validation cohort. Positive predictors included smoking, previously treated cases, and adverse drug reactions, while concurrent diabetes was protective. Based on the validation dataset, the model demonstrated good calibration (P = 0.143) with acceptable discriminative ability (AUC = 0.775). A cutoff score of 2.5 out of 11 achieved a sensitivity of 81 % and a specificity of 64.4 %.

This study proposes a new application of these classifiers to detect SDB by considering several person-fit indices as features or predictors in the machine learning methods. The results of a Monte Carlo simulation study showed that for a single feature, applying person-fit indices directly and logistic regression led to similar classification results. However, the random forest classifier improved the classification of biased and unbiased responses substantially.

Fifteen to 23% of patients undergoing cardiovascular surgery and cardiomyopathy experience delirium, and the efficacy of treatment interventions for delirium has been consistently unsatisfactory. A total of 729 patients who underwent cardiovascular surgery were randomly allocated into a training set and a validation set. A nomogram was developed using a logistic regression model to predict the incidence of delirium following cardiovascular surgery. The validity of the model was assessed by determining the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calculating the area under the ROC curve (AUROC), performing a calibration plot, and executing a decision curve analysis. This model was internally validated using the bootstrap method. Postoperative delirium (POD) occurred in 165 cases (22.6%) among the 729 patients. Predictors included age, transient ischemic attack, length of preoperative stay, preoperative left ventricular injection fraction and N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide level, and intraoperative infusion of dexmedetomidine and human fibrinogen. The nomogram showed sufficient differentiation and calibration (AUROC = 0.754, 95% confidence interval = 0.703-0.804). The calibration graphs showed that the predictive values of the nomogram were in agreement with the actual values.

Understanding the biological processes underlying the pathogenesis of POCD is essential for identifying mechanistic biomarkers to advance diagnostics and therapeutics. This study aimed to provide a comprehensive analysis of immune cell trajectories differentiating patients with and without POCD and to derive a predictive score enabling the identification of high-risk patients during the preoperative period. Twenty-six patients aged 60 years old and older undergoing elective major orthopedic surgery were enrolled in a prospective longitudinal study, and the occurrence of POCD was assessed 7 days after surgery. Serial samples collected before surgery, and 1, 7, and 90 days after surgery were analyzed using a combined single-cell mass cytometry and plasma proteomic approach. Unsupervised clustering of the high-dimensional mass cytometry data was employed to characterize time-dependent trajectories of all major innate and adaptive immune cell frequencies and signaling responses. Sparse machine learning coupled with data-driven feature selection was applied to the presurgery immunological dataset to classify patients at risk for POCD. The analysis identified cell-type and signaling-specific immune trajectories differentiating patients with and without POCD. The most prominent trajectory features revealed early exacerbation of JAK/STAT and dampening of inhibitory κB and nuclear factor-κB immune signaling responses in patients with POCD. Further analyses integrating immunological and clinical data collected before surgery identified a preoperative predictive model comprising one plasma protein and 10 immune cell features that classified patients at risk for POCD with excellent accuracy (AUC=0.80, P =2.21e-02 U -test). Immune system-wide monitoring of patients over 60 years old undergoing surgery unveiled a peripheral immune signature of POCD. A predictive model built on immunological data collected before surgery demonstrated greater accuracy in predicting POCD compared to known clinical preoperative risk factors, offering a concise list of biomarker candidates to personalize perioperative management.","2024","International journal of surgery (London, England)"

The Kaplan-Meier method was used to draw survival curves, and Log-Rank test was used for survival analysis. The study found that the occurrence of LM after CRC surgery was significantly associated with CA199 positivity, VI, PNI, N1-2 stage, CT-LFF, VAT index (VATI). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that CA199 positivity (OR = 7.659), N1-2 stage (OR = 6.394), CT-LFF (OR = 1.271), VATI (OR = 1.043) were independent risk factors for predicting LM after CRC surgery. The multivariate logistic regression model, constructed using these independent risk factors, demonstrated robust predictive performance across 5-fold cross-validations, with an average AUC of 0.898 (95 % CI: 0.828-0.969). Survival analysis showed a significant difference in liver metastasis-free survival rates between the high-risk and low-risk groups (P < 0.001). CT-LFF and VATI assessed by CT are independent risk factors for predicting LM after CRC surgery. The multivariate prediction model combining CA199 and N stage shows high predictive performance.","2024","European journal of radiology"

Data from patients under 35 years of age who visited the Liver Health Clinic at the Armed Forces Goyang Hospital between July 2022 and January 2024 were retrospectively collected. Steatosis was diagnosed on the basis of a controlled attenuation parameter score ≥250 dB/m. MASLD was defined as the presence of steatosis in patients with at least one cardiometabolic risk factor. Among the 1,382 study participants, 901 were diagnosed with MASLD. All eight indices for diagnosing steatosis differed significantly between the MASLD and non-MASLD groups (p<0.001). Regarding the predictive performance, the hepatic steatosis index (HSI), fatty liver index (FLI), Framingham steatosis index, Dallas steatosis index, Zhejiang University index, lipid accumulation product, visceral adiposity index, and triglyceride glucose-body mass index exhibited an area under the curve of 0.898, 0.907, 0.899, 0.893, 0.915, 0.869, 0.791, and 0.898, respectively. The cutoff values for the FLI and HSI were re-examined, indicating a need for alternative cutoff values for the HSI, with a rule-in value of 42 and a rule-out value of 36 in this population.

This study aimed to compare the image quality and diagnostic performance of three-dimensional (3D) and two-dimensional (2D) T2WI in diagnosing muscle invasion of bladder cancer using Vesical Imaging Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS). Between August 2022 and May 2023, 101 participants with bladder cancer underwent multiparametric MRI including 3D and 2D T2WI. Two radiologists independently reviewed 2D and 3D T2WI, evaluating image quality and muscle invasion based on VI-RADS scoring. The paired Wilcoxon signed-rank test assessed the differences between 2D and 3D T2WI. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUCs) were utilized to compare the diagnostic performance. 3D T2WI demonstrated significantly superior overall image quality scores with less artifacts than 2D T2WI. Compared to 2D T2WI, 3D T2WI categories had significantly higher AUC for both readers (reader 1: 0.937 vs. 0.909, p = .02; reader 2: 0.923 vs.0.884, p = .04).

This study aimed to develop a macrophage-associated diagnostic signature for CRSwNP. Transcriptome data from 54 patients with CRSwNP and 37 healthy controls across GSE136825, GSE36830, and GSE72713 were used to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between two groups. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis and Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis pinpointed crucial pathways and gene clusters. A diagnostic model was created from these analyses and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), and further validated in our transcriptome data from 29 samples. Immune cell infiltration analysis was performed and linked those diagnostic genes to macrophages and verified by single-cell RNA sequencing data. Immunofluorescence co-staining of CD163 and HMOX1 was performed in nasal tissues. Mouse bone marrow-derived macrophage (BMDMs) cultures were used in functional experiments. Correlations between the expression of HMOX1 and eotaxin genes were investigated. DEGs of CRSwNP versus control group were enriched in the INTERLEUKIN_4_AND_13_SIGNALING pathways. A four-gene diagnostic model (HMOX1, ALOX5, F13A1 and ITGB2) was developed and demonstrated high diagnostic precision with an area under ROC curve of 0.980 for training dataset and 0.895 for test dataset. M2 macrophage presence and HMOX1 expression significantly correlated with CRSwNP (p < 0.001). Single-cell RNA sequencing data underscored the altered cellular composition in CRSwNP, with HMOX1 notably expressed in M2 macrophages. Immunofluorescence staining highlighted the increased infiltration of CD163+ M2 macrophages in nasal mucosa samples of eosinophilic CRSwNP, which correlated with HMOX1 protein levels (p < 0.05). The HMOX1 inhibitor zinc protoporphyrin reduced the ratio of CD163 + HMOX1 + M2 macrophages in mouse BMDM cultures (p < 0.05). HMOX1 expression showed a strong positive correlation with the expression of eotaxin genes (CCL11, CCL24, and CCL26; p < 0.05 respectively). M2 macrophage-derived HMOX1 can be used as an innovative diagnostic signature for CRSwNP, which might be a potential regulator of eosinophilic inflammation.","2024","Clinical and translational allergy"

This retrospective study included 23,225 patients who underwent prostate MRI between 2017 and 2022. Cancer risk factors (family history of cancer and digital rectal exam findings), pre-MRI prostate pathology, and treatment history of prostate cancer were extracted from free-text clinical notes in English as binary or multi-class classification tasks. Any sentence containing pre-defined keywords was extracted from clinical notes within one year before the MRI. After manually creating sentence-level datasets with ground truth, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT)-based sentence-level models were fine-tuned using the extracted sentence as input and the category as output. The patient-level output was determined by compilation of multiple sentence-level outputs using tree-based models. Sentence-level classification performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) on 15% of the sentence-level dataset (sentence-level test set). The patient-level classification performance was evaluated on the patient-level test set created by radiologists by reviewing the clinical notes of 603 patients. Accuracy and sensitivity were compared between the pipeline and radiologists. Sentence-level AUCs were ≥ 0.94. The pipeline showed higher patient-level sensitivity for extracting cancer risk factors (e.g., family history of prostate cancer, 96.5% vs. 77.9%, p < 0.001), but lower accuracy in classifying pre-MRI prostate pathology (92.5% vs. 95.9%, p = 0.002) and treatment history of prostate cancer (95.5% vs. 97.7%, p = 0.03) than radiologists, respectively. The proposed pipeline showed promising performance, especially for extracting cancer risk factors from patient's clinical notes. The natural language processing pipeline showed a higher sensitivity for extracting prostate cancer risk factors than radiologists and may help efficiently gather relevant text information when interpreting prostate MRI.

The roles of intestinal microbiome and its metabolites in therapeutic adverse events remain unclear. We collected baseline fecal samples from 21 patients with adverse events (AE group) and 11 patients without adverse events (Non-AE group). Their microbiota and metabolome were characterized using metagenomic shotgun sequencing and untargeted metabolomics. At the species level, the gut microbiota in the Non-AE group exhibits significantly higher abundance of Clostridium sp. Alistipes sp. and lower abundance of Lachnoclostridium sp. Weissella cibaria, Weissella confusa, compared to the AE group (p < .05). A total of 58 discriminative metabolites were identified between groups. Beta-alanine metabolism was scattered. Boc-beta-cyano-L-alanine and CoQ9 were significantly increased in patients without adverse events, while linoleic acid increased in patients with adverse events. The increased Alistipes sp. in the Non-AE group was positively correlated with Boc-beta-cyano-L-alanine and negatively correlated with linoleic acid (p < .05). We constructed a combined microbiome-metabolite model to distinguish Non-AE and AE patients with an AUC of 0.963 via the random forest algorithm. Our findings provided a novel insight into the interplay of multispecies microbial cluster and metabolites of rectal patients with adverse events in neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy combined with immunotherapy.

This study analyzed over two million patients from the Nationwide Inpatient Sample database undergoing elective total knee arthroplasty (TKA) for primary osteoarthritis. Baseline demographics, clinical characteristics and incidence of postoperative complications were examined. A neural network model was utilized to predict high-risk patients who fall into the top 25% for both LOS and total hospital charges after complications such as sepsis or surgical site infection (SSI). The most common complications were blood loss anaemia (14.6%), acute kidney injury (1.6%) and urinary tract infection (0.9%). Patients with complications incurred significantly higher total charges (mean $66,804) and longer LOS (mean 2.9 days) compared to those without complications (mean $58,545 and 2.1 days, respectively). The neural network model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with an area under the curve of 0.83 for the training set and 0.78 for the testing set. Key complications like sepsis and SSIs significantly impacted hospital charges and LOS. For example, a 57-year-old patient with diabetes and sepsis had a 100% probability of being in the top 25% for both total charges and LOS. Postoperative complications in TKA patients significantly increase hospital charges and LOS.

While EPR has been a key strategy, its inconsistent clinical success lacks clear mechanistic understanding and is hindered by limited tools for studying relevant phenomena. This work introduces an approach that employs multiparametric dynamic contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) with a nanoscale contrast agent for noninvasive, real-time examination of tumor microenvironment characteristics. We demonstrate that CEUS imaging can: (1) evaluate tumor microenvironment features, (2) be used to help predict the distribution of doxorubicin-loaded liposomes in the tumor parenchyma, and (3) be used to predict nanotherapeutic efficacy. CEUS using nanobubbles (NBs) was carried out in two tumor types of high (LS174T) and low (U87) vascular permeability. LS174T tumors consistently showed significantly different time intensity curve (TIC) parameters, including area under the rising curve (AUCR, 2.7×) and time to peak intensity (TTP, 1.9×) compared to U87 tumors. Crucially, a recently developed decorrelation time (DT) parameter specific to NB CEUS dynamics successfully predicted the distribution of doxorubicin-loaded liposomes within the tumor parenchyma (r = 0.86 ± 0.13). AUCR, TTP, and DT were used to correlate imaging findings to nanotherapeutic response with 100% accuracy in SKOV-3 tumors. These findings suggest that NB-CEUS parameters can effectively discern tumor vascular permeability, serving as a biomarker for identifying tumor characteristics and predicting the responsiveness to nanoparticle-based therapies. The observed differences between LS174T and U87 tumors and the accurate prediction of nanotherapeutic efficacy in SKOV-3 tumors indicate the potential utility of this method in predicting treatment efficacy and evaluating EPR in diseases characterized by pathologically permeable vasculature. Ultimately, this research contributes valuable insights into refining drug delivery strategies and assessing the broader applicability of EPR-based approaches.","2024","ACS nano"

Traditional laboratory testing methods are costly and time-consuming with raised ethical issues. Only a few in silico models have been reported to predict human reproductive toxicity, but none of them make full use of the topological information of compounds. In addition, most existing atom-based graph neural network methods focus on attributing model predictions to individual nodes or edges rather than chemically meaningful fragments or substructures. In current studies, we develop a novel fragment-based graph transformer network (FGTN) approach to generate the QSAR model of human reproductive toxicity by considering internal topological structure information of compounds. In the FGTN model, the compound is represented by a graph architecture using fragments to be nodes and bonds linking two fragments to be edges. A super molecule-level node is further proposed to connect all fragment nodes by undirected edges, obtaining global molecular features from fragment embeddings. The FGTN model achieved an accuracy (ACC) of 0.861 and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.914 on nonredundant blind tests, outperforming traditional fingerprint-based machine learning models and atom-based GCN model. The FGTN model can attribute toxic predictions to fragments, generating specific structural alerts for the positive compound. Moreover, FGTN may also have the capability to distinguish various chemical isomers. We believe that FGTN can be used as a reliable and effective tool for human reproductive toxicity prediction in contribution to the advancement of chemical safety assessment.","2024","Archives of toxicology"

Median age at diagnosis was 68 years. Patients presented with bladder tumors in 73.8% and upper urinary tract tumors in 26.2%. 63.7% of patients had received only one line of chemotherapy before ICIs. Median follow-up after starting ICIs was 8.9 months. The variables statistically associated with objective response were: - The presence of locally advanced or lymph node-only disease compared with visceral involvement (adjusted Odds Ratio 0.19, 95% confidence interval [0.06-0.55], P = .002) and bone-only involvement (aOR 0.22 [0.08-0.64], P = .005) - The absence of antibiotic therapy the month before/after ICIs initiation (aOR 0.31 [0.12-0.84], P = .021). Limitations included retrospective design and small number of patients included.

Two breast radiologists independently evaluated each lesion using the Kaiser score (KS) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values, without knowledge of the pathological outcomes. NME lesions with a KS above 4 and an ADC value below 1.3 × 10-3mm2/s were classified as malignant. Inter-rater reliability was determined using Cohen's Kappa (κ) statistics. The diagnostic performance of KS, DWI, and their combination was assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the curve (AUC), and the results were compared across the benign and malignant groups. The diagnostic performance of KS surpassed that of DWI in predicting the malignancy of NMEs (p = 0.003). The sensitivity of KS alone was 93 %; however, when ADC data was incorporated, the sensitivity decreased to 86 %, with no significant difference observed (p = 0.060).

This study aimed to identify multimodal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) biomarkers of epilepsy in patients with TSC and develop a prediction model of epileptogenicity in these patients. Patients with TSC, with or without epilepsy, were recruited. All patients underwent MRI scanning, including T1WI, T2WI, T2W-FLAIR, DTI, and multi-parametric MR with a flexible design (MULTIPLEX). We compared the multimodal cerebral MRI characteristics of the cortical tubers, subependymal nodules, and perilesional tissue between patients with TSC with or without epilepsy and developed a prediction model for epileptogenicity. Among the patients with TSC, 32 with and 16 without epilepsy underwent MRI. Higher proton-density mapping (PD) of cortical tubers and decreased fractional anisotropy (FA), increased mean diffusivity (MD), and increased radial diffusivity (RD) of subependymal nodules were associated with epileptogenicity in both the centre and perilesional tissue, independent of TSC gene variation. Based on the above findings, we developed a prediction model for epileptogenicity with an area under the curve of 0.973, specificity of 0.909, and sensitivity of 0.963 (P < 0.001). In patients with TSC, high PD of the cortical tubers, decreased FA, and elevated MD/RD of the subependymal nodules were significantly associated with epileptogenicity.

Therefore, quantification and prediction of disease comorbidities is necessary to stratify the mortality risk of the patients, predict the probability of their occurrence, design treatment strategies, and to prevent the progression of diseases. Enriching comorbidity disease relationships with rich semantics established by genetic components play a vital role in effectively quantifying and predicting comorbidities. However, the existing studies have not extensively explored the semantic richness conveyed by different types of genetic links connecting the comorbidity pairs. To solve this, a novel genetic-semantic aware weighted homogeneous network-based method, GSWHomoNet is proposed which first constructs the gene enriched comorbidity heterogeneous network, CoGHetNet with encoded genetic semantic aware weighted meta-path instance disease pair embedding to obtain an enhanced disease node embedding of the network. For enhanced comorbidity prediction and scoring, both direct and indirect semantically enriched comorbidity relationships of the disease nodes is preserved while transforming heterogeneous to homogeneous comorbidity network GSWHomoNet. The proposed GSWHomoNet not only helps discover comorbidity links transductively between known-known disease pairs but also improves the inductive link prediction between known-unknown disease pairs by supplying unknown disease nodes with semantically enriched heterogeneous structural knowledge. The effectiveness of the proposed components is proved by AUC scores of 0.895 and 0.860, as well as AUPR scores of 0.903 and 0.873 for transductive and inductive link prediction respectively. In comorbidity scoring, GSWHomoNet outperformed other methods with a correlation result of 0.848. The effect of the improved association prediction ability of the genetic semantic aware weighted meta-path instance embedding based node embedding is proved on disease-microbe and bibliographic heterogeneous network datasets. For biological significance of GSWHomoNet-based comorbidity scoring, we compared it with gene, pathway, and protein-protein interaction (PPI) perspectives, revealing a stronger correlation with the PPI aspect. We identified a substantial number of predicted comorbidity disease pairs, with 77,456 and 48,972 pairs supported by literature evidence for transductive and inductive predictions, respectively.

A total of 407 patients in the prospective cohort met inclusion criteria, and 62% were male. The mean ± SD age was 13.7 ± 2.2 years, height 161.8 ± 5.3 cm, and weight 59.2 ± 42.2 kg. Arthroscopic evaluation yielded 235 immobile and 172 mobile lesions. Multivariable analysis determined that the best model to predict lesion mobility included chronologic age ≥14 years (P < .001), effusion on physical examination (P < .001), and any loss of range of motion on physical examination (P = .07), while controlling for male sex (P = .38) and weight >54.4 kg (P = .12). In the 25% holdout validation sample (n = 102), a sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 82%, and an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI, 0.82-0.95) were achieved with these predictive factors. Age, effusion, and loss of motion can predict knee OCD lesion mobility at the time of arthroscopy. Education about lesion mobility can help with surgical planning and patient and family counseling.","2024","The American journal of sports medicine"

Understanding infection risks in wildlife reservoirs in relation to environmental factors is crucial for assessing exposure risk in domestic dogs. The regional prevalence of D. immitis infection was estimated in trapped wild coyotes and red foxes across Québec, Canada. Spatial clusters of infection were detected using Kulldorff's spatial scan statistics. A series of logistic regression models predicting the D. immitis status in coyotes were built from heartworm development unit (HDU) estimates and cumulative precipitation variables over various time periods. Between October 2020 and March 2021, 421 coyotes and 284 red foxes were examined for the presence of D. immitis. The parasite was found in 43 coyotes and 1 red fox. A high-risk infection cluster was detected in coyotes in southwestern Québec. The best model included as sole predictor the average cumulative HDU contributing to risk of D. immitis in the three years preceding coyote capture. This model significantly predicted infection status with an area under the curve of 76.1%. The cumulative precipitation had no notable effect in any model. This study highlights a high prevalence of D. immitis in coyotes in Québec with regional differences correlated to temperature-derived predictors. The spatial risk of infection in this population likely represents the environmental risk of exposure to the parasite given that coyotes do not receive preventive treatment compared to domestic dogs. Our findings are important for veterinarians in the application of prevention strategies for heartworm disease in domestic dogs.","2024","International journal for parasitology.

The categorization of grade and texture for nodules is particularly significant since it can aid radiologists and clinicians to make better-informed decisions concerning the management of nodules. However, currently existing nodule classification techniques have a singular function of nodule classification and rely on an extensive amount of high-quality annotation data, which does not meet the requirements of clinical practice. To address this issue, we develop an anthropomorphic diagnosis system of pulmonary nodules (PN) based on deep learning (DL) that is trained by weak annotation data and has comparable performance to full-annotation based diagnosis systems. The proposed system uses DL models to classify PNs (benign vs. malignant) with weak annotations, which eliminates the need for time-consuming and labor-intensive manual annotations of PNs. Moreover, the PN classification networks, augmented with handcrafted shape features acquired through the ball-scale transform technique, demonstrate capability to differentiate PNs with diverse labels, including pure ground-glass opacities, part-solid nodules, and solid nodules. Through 5-fold cross-validation on two datasets, the system achieved the following results: (1) an Area Under Curve (AUC) of 0.938 for PN localization and an AUC of 0.912 for PN differential diagnosis on the LIDC-IDRI dataset of 814 testing cases, (2) an AUC of 0.943 for PN localization and an AUC of 0.815 for PN differential diagnosis on the in-house dataset of 822 testing cases. In summary, our system demonstrates eﬀicient localization and differential diagnosis of PNs in a resource limited environment, and thus could be translated into clinical use in the future.","2024","Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society"

Wind erosion hazard maps can assist in identifying the regions of highest wind erosion risk and are a valuable tool for the mitigation of its destructive consequences. This study aims to map wind erosion hazards by developing an interpretable (explainable) model based on machine learning (ML) and Shapley additive exPlanation (SHAP) interpretation techniques. Four ML models, namely random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGB), and quadratic discriminant analysis (QDA) were used. Thirteen features associated with wind erosion were mapped spatially and then subjected to a multivariate adaptive regression spline (MARS) feature selection algorithm, and then, tolerance coefficient (TC) and variance inflation factor (VIF) statistical tests were used to explore multicollinearity among the variables. MARS analysis shows that eight features consisting of elevation (or DEM), soil bulk density, precipitation, aspect, slope, soil sand content, vegetation cover (or NDVI), and lithology were the most effective for wind erosion, while no collinearity existed among these variables. The ML models were used for ranking the effective features, and the research introduces the application of an interpretable ML model for the interpretation of predictive model's output. The ranking of effective features by RF-as the most typical ML model-revealed that elevation and soil bulk density were the two most important features. According to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) (with a value > 90%) and precision-recall (PR) (with a value > 90%) curves, all four ML models performed with great accuracy. According to the PR curve, the SVM model performed slightly better than others, and its results revealed that 20.9%, 23%, and 16.6% of the total area in Hormozgan Province is characterized by moderate, high, and very high hazard classes to wind erosion, respectively. SHAP revealed that soil sand content and elevation are the most important variables contributing to the predictive model output. Overall, our research is one of the pioneering applications of interpretable ML models in mapping wind erosion hazards in Southern Iran. We recommend that future research should address the aspect of interpretability in order to better understand predictive model outputs.","2024","Environmental science and pollution research international"

However, the differential diagnosis could represent a major challenge since the two disorders are all heterogeneous entities with overlapping clinical characteristics and radiological appearances. In this paper, we conduct a retrospective study to develop a model based on clinical data and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to distinguish CNSL from CNSI. A total of 108 patients with AL who underwent cranial MRI between January 2020 and December 2023 in our hospital were included. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the independent predictors. A nomogram was developed based on the predictors, and the performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The validation cohort was used to test the predictive model. Hyperleukocytosis at initial diagnosis, marrow state, fever, conscious disturbance, coinfection in other sites and MRI (parenchyma type) were identified as independent factors.

Among different parameters, MTV was identified as the optimal prognostic parameter with a maximum area under the curve (AUC) of 0.652 ± 0.112 than TLG and SDmax (0.645 ± 0.113 and 0.600 ± 0.117, respectively). Patients with high MTV were associated with inferior PFS (p < 0.001 and p = 0.021, respectively) and OS (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively) in both the training and validation cohort. The multivariate analysis revealed that high MTV was an unfavorable factor for PFS (relative ratio [RR], 2.295; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.457-3.615; p < 0.01) and OS (RR, 2.929; 95% CI 1.679-5.109; p < 0.01) independent of IPI. Further analysis showed MTV could improve the risk stratification of IPI for both PFS and OS (p < 0.01 and p < 0.01, respectively). In conclusion, our study suggests that MTV was an optimal prognostic parameter of PET/CT for survival and it could improve the risk stratification of IPI in DLBCL, which may help to guide treatment in clinical trial.","2024","Annals of hematology"

We hypothesized that the incidence of postoperative complications after liver resection would be predicted well by liver resection complexity and nutritional status. We retrospectively assessed patients undergoing liver resection at The University of Tokyo Hospital from 2011 to 2021. Liver resection procedures were categorized by surgical complexity using a 3-level complexity classification. Nutritional parameters (including cholinesterase and albumin levels) were evaluated together with well-known nutritional indexes, including the modified Glasgow Prognostic Score, prognostic nutritional index, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, and controlling nutritional status. Of 1,258 patients, 570 (44.5%) experienced postoperative complications, with 506 (39.9%) requiring treatment (Clavien-Dindo grade II or greater). Multivariate logistic regression model analyses showed that cholinesterase and albumin levels, complexity classification, and open approach were associated with postoperative complications. The cholinesterase-liver resection complexity/approach model (area under the curve, 0.634) performed significantly better in predicting complications than the prognostic nutritional index (area under the curve, 0.560; P < .001), modified Glasgow Prognostic Score (area under the curve, 0.557; P < .001), controlling nutritional status (area under the curve, 0.502; P < .001), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (area under the curve, 0.513; P < .001), and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio scores (area under the curve, 0.515; P < .001). On the basis of the cholinesterase-liver resection complexity/approach model, estimated complications ranged from 9.6% to 53.4%, and patients with well-maintained cholinesterase levels were estimated to have a 5-15% lower probability of complications than patients with impaired cholinesterase levels. This finding was validated with an external Western cohort. The cholinesterase-liver resection complexity/approach model better predicted postoperative complications than nutritional indicators alone and may be useful for selecting patients who may benefit from nutritional support.","2024","Surgery"

Identifying high-risk patients preoperatively is important. This study aimed to construct a preoperative prediction model for the early recurrence of patients with pCCA to facilitate planned treatment with curative resection. This study ultimately enrolled 400 patients with pCCA after curative resection in 5 hospitals between 2013 and 2019. They were randomly divided into training (n = 300) and testing groups (n = 100) at a ratio of 3:1. Associated variables were identified via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Four machine learning models were constructed: support vector machine, random forest (RF), logistic regression, and K-nearest neighbors. The predictive ability of the models was evaluated via receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves, precision-recall curve (PRC) curves, and decision curve analysis. Kaplan-Meier (K-M) survival curves were drawn for the high-/low-risk population. Five factors: carbohydrate antigen 19-9, tumor size, total bilirubin, hepatic artery invasion, and portal vein invasion, were selected by LASSO regression. In both the training and testing groups, the ROC curve (area under the curve: 0.983 vs 0.952) and the PRC (0.981 vs 0.939) showed that RF was the best. The cutoff value for distinguishing high- and low-risk patients was 0.51. K-M survival curves revealed that in both groups, there was a significant difference in RFS between high- and low-risk patients (P < .001). This study used preoperative variables from a large, multicenter database to construct a machine learning model that could effectively predict the early recurrence of pCCA in patients to facilitate planned treatment with curative resection and help clinicians make better treatment decisions.","2024","Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract"

Additionally, the complexity of patent protection for novel compounds presents challenges for pharmaceutical innovation. Drug repositioning offers an alternative strategy to uncover new therapeutic uses for existing medicines. Previous repositioning models have been limited by their reliance on homogeneous data sources, failing to leverage the rich information available in heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graphs. We propose HeteroKGRep, a novel drug repositioning model that utilizes heterogeneous graphs to address these limitations. HeteroKGRep is a multi-step framework that first generates a similarity graph from hierarchical concept relations. It then applies SMOTE over-sampling to address class imbalance before generating node sequences using a heterogeneous graph neural network. Drug and disease embeddings are extracted from the network and used for prediction. We evaluated HeteroKGRep on a graph containing biomedical concepts and relations from ontologies, pathways and literature. It achieved state-of-the-art performance with 99% accuracy, 95% AUC ROC and 94% average precision on predicting repurposing opportunities. Compared to existing homogeneous approaches, HeteroKGRep leverages diverse knowledge sources to enrich representation learning. Based on heterogeneous graphs, HeteroKGRep can discover new drug-desease associations, leveraging de novo drug development.

The objective of this study was to investigate the pathogenesis of MDD and to explore its association with the immune system by identifying hub biomarkers using bioinformatics analyses and examining immune infiltrates in human autopsy samples. Gene microarray data were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets GSE32280, GSE76826, GSE98793, and GSE39653. Our approach included differential expression analysis, weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA), and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network analysis to identify hub genes associated with MDD. Subsequently, gene ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), Cytoscape plugin CluGO, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) were utilized to identify immune-related genes. The final selection of immune-related hub genes was determined through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (Lasso) regression analysis and PPI analysis. Immune cell infiltration in MDD patients was analyzed using CIBERSORT, and correlation analysis was performed between key immune cells and genes. The diagnostic accuracy of the identified hub genes was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Furthermore, we conducted a study involving 10 MDD patients and 10 healthy controls (HCs) meeting specific criteria to assess the expression levels of these hub genes in their peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). The Herbal Ingredient Target Database (HIT) was employed to screen for herbal components that target these genes, potentially identifying novel therapeutic agents. A total of 159 down-regulated and 51 up-regulated genes were identified for further analysis. WGCNA revealed 12 co-expression modules, with modules ""darked"", ""darkurquoise"" and ""light yellow"" showing significant positive associations with MDD. Functional enrichment pathway analysis indicated that these differential genes were associated with immune functions. Integration of differential and immune-related gene analysis identified 21 common genes. The Lasso algorithm confirmed 4 hub genes as potential biomarkers for MDD. GSEA analysis suggested that these genes may be involved in biological processes such as protein export, RNA degradation, and fc gamma r mediated cytotoxis. Pathway enrichment analysis identified three highly enriched immune-related pathways associated with the 4 hub genes. ROC curve analysis indicated that these hub genes possess good diagnostic value. Quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) demonstrated significant expression differences of these hub genes in PBMCs between MDD patients and HCs. Immune infiltration analysis revealed significant correlations between immune cells, including Mast cells resting, T cells CD8, NK cells resting, and Neutrophils, which were significantly correlated with the hub genes expression. HIT identified one herb target related to IL7R and 14 targets related to TLR2. The study identified four immune-related hub genes (TLR2, RETN, HP, and IL7R) in MDD that may impact the diagnosis and treatment of the disorder. By leveraging the GEO database, our findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between MDD and immunity, presenting potential therapeutic targets.","2024","Frontiers in psychiatry"

Here, we explore the potential of machine learning (ML) to forecast the abundances of N-glycan types based on variables related to the growth media. The ML models exploit a dataset consisting of detailed glycomic characterisation of Anti-HER fed-batch bioreactor cell cultures measured daily under 12 different culture conditions, such as changes in levels of dissolved oxygen, pH, temperature, and the use of two different commercially available media. By performing spent media quantitation and subsequent calculation of pseudo cell consumption rates (termed media markers) as inputs to the ML model, we were able to demonstrate a small subset of media markers (18 selected out of 167 mass spectrometry peaks) in a Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cell cultures are important to model N-glycan relative abundances (Regression - correlations between 0.80-0.92; Classification - AUC between 75.0-97.2). The performances suggest the ML models can infer N-glycan critical quality attributes from extracellular media as a proxy.

CSF amyloid status was classified as amyloid-positive (A+) or amyloid-negative (A-) based on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Statistical analyses included Spearman correlation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and multivariate logistic regression to evaluate biomarker performance. Among 165 individuals (83 females), 29.1% were classified as A+. Significant correlations were found between plasma and CSF biomarkers, with the highest for the pTau181/Aβ42 ratio (ρ=0.620, p < 0.0001).

To elucidate the relationship between asbestos exposure and alterations in DNA methylation patterns, as well as the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of differentially methylated regions and CpG sites (DMRs/DMCs) in the progression of MM. The current study employed reduced representation bisulﬁte sequencing (RRBS) to examine the genome-wide DNA methylation profiles in the peripheral blood of individuals exposed to asbestos and those diagnosed with MM, in comparison to the controls, and DMRs/DMCs were subsequently validated by targeted bisulfite sequencing (TBS). Our results suggested that there were 12 DMRs/DMCs exhibiting a consistent change trend of DNA methylation in both RRBS and TBS results. Significant correlations were observed between DNA methylation levels of DMRs/DMCs and the duration of occupational asbestos exposure. The evaluation of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve suggested that the DNA methylation status of FHIT, CCR12P and CDH15 may serve as diagnosis indicator in distinguishing MM patients from healthy controls and those exposed to asbestos.

We integrated summary-level data from genome-wide association studies on DN with expression quantitative trait loci data to identify genes with potential causal relationships to DN. The predictive performance of the biomarker gene was validated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Gene set enrichment and correlation analyses were conducted to investigate potential mechanisms. Finally, the biomarker gene was validated using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction in clinical samples from patients with DN and controls. Based on identified 314 DEGs, seven characteristic genes with high predictive performance were identified using three integrated machine learning algorithms. MR analysis revealed 219 genes with significant causal effects on DN, ultimately identifying one co-expressed gene, carbonic anhydrase II (CA2), as a key biomarker for DN.

Item redundancy was evaluated using Cronbach's alpha (α > 0.90), test-retest reliability using Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC2,1) and Cohen's kappa using established cutoffs score for categorising patients into risk groups, construct validity using hypothesis testing (if a minimum of 75% of the hypotheses were supported), and discriminant validity using Area Under the Curve (AUC) with the reference scales administered at baseline. Cronbach's alpha scores were 0.72 for the overall scale and 0.66 for the psychosocial subscale. Test-retest reliability values were good to excellent with ICC2,1 of 0.94 (95% CI: 0.87-0.97) for the overall scale and 0.87 (95% CI: 0.73-0.94) for the psychosocial subscale and Kappa values of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.43-0.93) for the overall scale and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.52-1.00) for psychosocial subscale. Construct validity was confirmed as 100% of a priori hypotheses were met. Acceptable discriminative validity was observed with reference scales with AUCs (0.75-0.80). Nepali SBST demonstrates the reliability and validity of screening for chronicity risk in Nepali adults with LBP. Future studies should evaluate its responsiveness, predictive abilities, and effectiveness in stratifying LBP patients in the Nepalese context.","2024","Musculoskeletal care"

A total of 162 patients with histopathologically confirmed PDAC who underwent DLCT examination were included and allocated to the training (114) and validation (48) sets. 3D VOI-iodine concentration (IC), 3D VOI-slope of the spectral attenuation curves, and 3D VOI-effective atomic number were obtained from the portal venous phase. The significant clinical features and DLCT quantitative parameters were identified through univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression. The discrimination capability and clinical applicability of the clinical, DLCT, and DLCT-clinical models were quantified by the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA), respectively. The optimal model was then used to develop a nomogram, with the goodness-of-fit evaluated through the calibration curve. The DLCT-clinical model demonstrated superior predictive capability and a satisfactory net benefit for Ki-67 PI in PDAC compared to the clinical and DLCT models. The DLCT-clinical model integrating 3D VOI-IC and CA125 showed area under the ROC curves of 0.939 (95% CI, 0.895-0.982) and 0.915 (95% CI, 0.834-0.996) in the training and validation sets, respectively. The nomogram derived from the DLCT-clinical model exhibited favorable calibration, as depicted by the calibration curve. The proposed model based on DLCT 3D VOI-IC and CA125 is a non-invasive and effective preoperative prediction tool demonstrating favorable predictive performance for Ki-67 PI in PDAC. The dual-layer detector spectral computed tomography-clinical model could help predict high Ki-67 PI in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma patients, which may help clinicians provide appropriate and individualized treatments. Dual-layer detector spectral CT (DLCT) could predict Ki-67 in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The DLCT-clinical model improved the differential diagnosis of Ki-67.

Therefore, novel biomarkers for the accurate detection of upper tract urothelial tumors are urgently needed. We evaluated the expression of Keratin 17 (KRT17), an oncoprotein implicated in the cell cycle progression of multiple human cancers and previously studied in bladder urothelial carcinoma, by immunohistochemistry in 139 UTUC cases, including noninvasive, invasive papillary urothelial carcinoma and urothelial carcinoma in situ. KRT17 expression pattern (basal/negative vs. nonbasal) and H-score were evaluated. The expression pattern was significantly different in normal (NL) compared to malignant urothelium. Nonbasal KRT17 expression was significantly higher in pTa (p < 0.001) and invasive (pTinv) (p = 0.0023) urothelial carcinoma compared to NL, and in pTinv compared to pTa (p = 0.0391). Sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing benign from malignant tumors were 85% and 82, respectively, with an area under the curve of 0.83 (p < 0.001). The KRT17 H-score was significantly higher in pTa and pTinv compared to NL (p < 0.001 and p = 0.0035, respectively). Sensitivity and specificity for distinguishing benign from malignant carcinoma were 91% and 69%, respectively, with an AUC of 0.81 (p = 0.0010). KRT17 was not associated with tumor site, grade, or stage. In summary, K17 is a sensitive and specific marker of neoplastic upper tract urothelium, and its potential use in routine diagnostics should be explored in larger studies.","2024","Human pathology"

B-mode and Power-Doppler mode MSUS images were acquired and scored according to the PAUSS-ankle protocol. A subset of patients received a contrast-enhanced MRI (ceMRI) of the affected ankle. ceMRI scoring for synovitis was performed according to the Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI System (RAMRIS). Test characteristics of the PAUSS-ankle scores were evaluated with ceMRI as reference. Associations between the findings on physical examination, PAUSS-ankle, and RAMRIS were investigated. Thirty-two patients with JIA contributed 63 MSUS and 15 ceMRIs of the ankles. The PAUSS-ankle total B-mode score had a moderate correlation with physical examination findings (correlation (r)=0.43, p < 0.001). The PAUSS-ankle B-mode score ≥1 exhibited a sensitivity of 79 % and specificity of 100 %, demonstrating excellent diagnostic accuracy with an area under the curve (AUC)= 0.89 (confidence intervals, CI, 0.78-1.00) while clinical assessment had a sensitivity of 57 % and AUC= 0.71 (CI: 0.58-0.85). The PAUSS-ankle B-mode score had significant strong correlations (r = 0.68-0.90, p < 0.005) with the RAMRIS for the assessment of disease severity for each joint area and the ankle joint as a whole. Our findings demonstrate excellent diagnostic accuracy of the PAUSS-ankle in detecting the presence and severity of ankle synovitis when compared to ceMRI.

Our cross-sectional, non-interventional study aimed to evaluate the prevalence of anemia and its subtypes, as well as their interactions, in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Methods: A total of 227 patients previously diagnosed with T2D were enrolled. These patients were assessed regarding their medical history and the evolution of their diabetes, and were screened for anemia. Results: Anemia was encountered in 32.6% of the 227 hospitalized patients previously diagnosed with T2D enrolled in this study. Its presence was associated with a higher prevalence of complications and comorbidities, such as chronic kidney disease (CKD), retinopathy, and atrial fibrillation. The most common types of anemia observed were those associated with CKD, other chronic conditions, and iron deficiency. A moderate, positive correlation (r = 0.307; p < 0.0001) has been observed between estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and hemoglobin, and a moderate, negative correlation has been observed between age and hemoglobin (r = -0.351; p < 0.0001), with the results also analyzed using multiple regression and ROC curve analysis. Additionally, a weak, positive, yet statistically significant correlation was observed between glycemic values and hemoglobin levels, which requires further research. Conclusions: Anemia is frequently encountered in patients with T2D, especially in those with increased age, decreased eGFR, and additional chronic degenerative complications or other comorbidities; thus, a systematic screening for an early diagnosis and interdisciplinary management is recommended for improved outcomes related to morbidity, mortality, and quality of life.","2024","Journal of clinical medicine"
693,"39429222","The potential for species distribution models to distinguish source populations from sinks.","While species distribution models (SDM) are frequently used to predict species occurrences to help inform conservation management, there is limited evidence evaluating whether habitat suitability can reliably predict intrinsic growth rates or distinguish source populations from sinks. Filling this knowledge gap is critical for conservation science, as applications of SDMs for management purposes ultimately depend on these typically unobserved population or metapopulation dynamics. Using linear regression, we associated previously published population level estimates of intrinsic growth and abundance derived from a Bayesian analysis of mark-recapture data for 17 bird species found in the contiguous United States with SDM habitat suitability estimates fitted here to opportunistic data for these same species. We then used the area under the ROC curve (AUC) to measure how well SDMs can distinguish populations categorized as sources and sinks. We built SDMs using two different approaches, boosted regression trees (BRT) and generalized linear models (GLM), and compared their source/sink predictive performance. Each SDM was built with presence points obtained from eBird (a web-available database) and 10 environmental variables previously selected to model intrinsic growth rates and abundance for these species. We show that SDMs built with opportunistic data are poor predictors of species demography in general; both BRT and GLM explained very little spatial variation of intrinsic growth rate and population abundance (median R2 across 17 species was close to 0.1 for both SDM methods). SDMs, however, estimated higher suitability for source populations as compared to sinks. Out of 13 species which had both source and sink populations, both BRT and GLM had AUC values greater than 0.7 for 7 species when discriminating between sources and sinks. Habitat suitability have the potential to be a useful measure to indicate a population's ability to sustain itself as a source population; however more research on a diverse set of taxa is essential to fully explore this potential. This interpretation of habitat suitability can be particularly useful for conservation practice, and identification of explicit cases of when and how SDMs fail to match population demography can be informative for advancing ecological theory.","2024","The Journal of animal ecology"

Foundational learning begins in graduate training. This study aimed to determine graduate student accuracy at identifying anatomical structures/landmarks during swallow evaluations and to determine if accuracy was predicted by type of imaging, anatomical structure, case type (i.e., normal/abnormal). Researchers recruited first-year graduate speech-language pathology students. Each participant reviewed five static images from lateral radiographic swallow studies and five static images from endoscopic swallow studies across 10 cases. Participants identified key anatomic structures and landmarks by clicking on the structure/landmark within a web-based platform. Two experienced speech-language pathologists reviewed and coded participant responses for accuracy. Sixteen graduate speech-language pathology students participated in a within-subjects design. Overall participant accuracy in identification of structure/landmarks was 69% (range 46%-88%). Binomial logistic regression was performed to study the effects of anatomical structure, case type (i.e., normal/abnormal), and image type on likelihood of participant accuracy in identifying anatomical structures (X 2(4) = 143.65, p < 0.001). Only anatomical structure was statistically significant (X 2(4) = 187.729, p < 0.001). The model explained 23.2% (Nagelkerke's R squared) of the variance in accuracy and correctly classified 78.4% of cases.

Mounting evidence suggests there are extensive transcriptional molecular changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of individuals with MDD. However, it remains unclear whether there are specific genes that are consistently altered and possess diagnostic power. In this study, we conducted a systematic search of PFC datasets of MDD patients from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. We calculated the differential expression of genes (DEGs) and identified robust DEGs using the RRA and MetaDE methods. Furthermore, we validated the consistently altered genes and assessed their diagnostic power through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay experiments in our clinical blood cohort. Additionally, we evaluated the diagnostic power of hub DEGs in independent public blood datasets. We obtained eight PFC datasets, comprising 158 MDD patients and 263 healthy controls, and identified a total of 1468 unique DEGs. Through integrated analysis, we identified 290 robustly altered DEGs. Among these, seven hub DEGs (SLC1A3, PON2, AQP1, EFEMP1, GJA1, CENPD, HSD11B1) were significantly down-regulated at the protein level in our clinical blood cohort. Moreover, these hub DEGs exhibited a negative correlation with the Hamilton Depression Scale score (P < 0.05). Furthermore, these hub DEGs formed a panel with promising diagnostic power in three independent public blood datasets (average AUCs of 0.85) and our clinical blood cohort (AUC of 0.92).

Liquid biopsy based on serum protein biomarkers has demonstrated great potential for early diagnosis but remains limited by the analysis performance of conventional immunoassay technologies, such as chemiluminescence, and biomarkers, such as CA125. To address this challenge and achieve accurate early-stage diagnosis of OC, we developed a digital immunoassay on a SlipChip (DiSC) for quantitative analysis of a potential serum protein biomarker, Spondin-1 (SPON1). The DiSC system achieved a limit of detection (LoD) of 23 fg/μL for digital quantification of SPON1. The DiSC system was utilized to quantify the serum level of SPON1 in 357 clinical serum samples, including 63 from patients with benign ovarian tumors and 294 from patients with malignant ovarian cancer, ranging from stages I to IV. SPON1 concentrations were significantly different in samples from patients with malignant ovarian cancer. Notably, significantly different SPON1 levels were observed in early stages (I and II), in lymph node-negative cases (N0), and before metastasis (M0), suggesting that SPON1 could serve as a sensitive diagnostic biomarker for early-stage OC. The differential diagnostic model based on SPON1 levels quantified using DiSC demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.8187 for early-stage OC, a significant improvement over CA-125 (AUC = 0.6967). For OC of all stages, the AUC was 0.8225, which could be further increased to 0.8750 when combined with CA-125. This showcases the potential of SPON1 as a novel biomarker for sensitive early-stage diagnosis of ovarian cancer and the capability of the DiSC system in discovering low-abundance biomarkers for disease diagnosis.","2024","Talanta"

Patients were divided into press-fit stable or unstable groups according to the intraoperative pull-out test of the implanted cup. Then, they were randomly assigned to the training or test cohort in an 8:2 ratio. We used 3Dslicer software to segment the region of interest (ROI) of the patient's bilateral hip X-ray to extract radiomics features. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was used in our feature selection. Finally, four machine learning models were employed in this study, including support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), logistic regression (LR), and XGBoost (XGB). Decision curve analysis (DCA), and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the models were plotted. The area under the curve (AUC), diagnostic accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated as well. The AUCs of the four models were compared using the DeLong test. Twenty-seven valuable radiomics features were determined by dimensionality reduction and selection. Regarding to the DeLong test, the AUC of the XGB model was significantly different from those of the other three models. (p < 0.05). Among all models, the XGB model exhibited the best performance with an AUC of 0.823 (95 % CI: 0.711-0.919) in the test cohort and showed optimal clinical efficacy according to the DCA.

In previous studies in patients with moderate-to-severe AD, lebrikizumab, administered subcutaneously via a prefilled syringe with a needle safety device (PFS-NSD), demonstrated rapid and durable dose-dependent efficacy. We assessed the pharmacokinetics and safety of lebrikizumab using either a PFS-NSD or an investigational autoinjector. Such devices have been developed to make self-injection easier for patients, thus increasing adherence over long treatment durations. The current study compared the pharmacokinetics and safety of 250 mg lebrikizumab (2 mL of a 125-mg/mL solution) administered subcutaneously at 1 of 3 different injection sites (abdomen, arm, or thigh) in 241 healthy participants using either a PFS-NSD (N = 122) or an investigational autoinjector (N = 119). Statistical analysis demonstrated 2-mL (125 mg/mL) lebrikizumab autoinjector was bioequivalent to 2-mL (125 mg/mL) lebrikizumab PFS-NSD as 90% CIs of the geometric least squares means ratios for lebrikizumab AUC(0-tlast), AUC(0-∞), and Cmax were all completely contained within the prespecified confidence limits of 0.80 and 1.25. Injection-site location did not appear to impact lebrikizumab systemic exposure for either device. Lebrikizumab was well tolerated with no SAEs reported after PFS-NSD or autoinjector administration.

However, previous evidence suggests that exercise at different times of the day in people with type 2 diabetes may have opposing outcomes on glycaemia. Metformin is the most commonly prescribed initial pharmacological intervention in type 2 diabetes, and may alter adaptions to exercise. It is unknown if there is an interaction between metformin and diurnal exercise outcomes. We aimed to investigate glycaemic outcomes of moderate intensity morning vs. evening exercise in people with type 2 diabetes being prescribed metformin monotherapy. In this study, nine males and nine females with type 2 diabetes undergoing metformin monotherapy (age 61 ± 8.2 years, mean ± SD) completed a 16-week crossover trial including 2-week baseline recording, 6 weeks randomly assigned to a morning exercise (07.00-10.00 h) or evening exercise (16.00-19.00 h) and a 2-week wash-out period. Exercise arms consisted of 30 min of walking at 70% of estimated max heart rate every other day. Glucose levels were measured with continuous glucose monitors and activity measured by wrist-worn monitors. Food-intake was recorded by 4-day food diaries during baseline, first and last 2 weeks of each exercise arm. There was no difference in exercise intensity, total caloric intake or total physical activity between morning and evening arms. As primary outcomes, acute (24 h) glucose area under the curve (AUC), was lower (P = 0.02) after acute morning exercise (180.6 ± 68.4 mmol/l) compared to baseline (210.3 ± 76.7 mmol/l); and there were no differences identified for glucose (mmol/l) between baseline, morning and evening exercise at any specific time point when data were analysed with two-way ANOVA. As secondary outcomes, acute glucose AUC was significantly lower (P = 0.01) in participants taking metformin before breakfast (152.5 ± 29.95 mmol/l) compared with participants taking metformin after breakfast (227.2 ± 61.51 mmol/l) only during the morning exercise arm; and during weeks 5-6 of the exercise protocol, glucose AUC was significantly lower (P = 0.04) for participants taking metformin before breakfast (168.8 ± 15.8 mmol/l), rather than after breakfast (224.5 ± 52.0 mmol/l), only during morning exercise. Our data reveal morning moderate exercise acutely lowers glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes being prescribed metformin. This difference appears to be driven by individuals that consumed metformin prior to breakfast rather than after breakfast. This beneficial effect upon glucose levels of combined morning exercise and pre-breakfast metformin persisted through the final 2 weeks of the trial. Our findings suggest that morning moderate intensity exercise combined with pre-breakfast metformin intake may benefit the management of glycaemia in people with type 2 diabetes. KEY POINTS: Morning moderate exercise acutely lowers glucose levels in people with type 2 diabetes being prescribed metformin. This difference appears to be driven by individuals that consumed metformin prior to breakfast rather than after breakfast. Morning exercise combined with pre-breakfast metformin persistently reduced glucose compared to morning exercise combined with post-breakfast metformin through the final week (week 6) of the intervention. Our study suggests it may be possible to make simple changes to the time that people with type 2 diabetes take metformin and perform exercise to improve their blood glucose.","2024","The Journal of physiology"

The gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis is laparoscopy, which is invasive and accompanied by several risks. Currently, there are no effective non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing endometriosis. Here, we investigated whether metabolites whose levels are altered in patients with endometriosis hold potential as diagnostic biomarkers for the disease. This case-control study involved 32 patients with endometriosis and 29 patients with other benign gynecological disease. The diagnosis of all patients was confirmed through postoperative histopathological examination, and the patients were divided into two groups: an endometriosis group (EM) and a control group. Fasting blood was collected and used for non-targeted metabolomic-based detection. The data were processed through principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, and significance analysis of microarrays. A univariate receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of the metabolites. The metabolite profiles of patients with endometriosis were markedly different compared with those of the controls. In addition, several metabolic pathways, including biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, arginine biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism, were altered. Ornithine and medorinone showed better potential as biomarkers for endometriosis diagnosis than CA125. We analyzed the altered metabolic profiles in patients with endometriosis and found ornithine and medorinone as potential non-invasive biomarkers for endometriosis diagnosis, whereas the combined ornithine-medorinone diagnosis is more valuable. These findings may help advance research on non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for endometriosis. Further research with an improved study design and a larger cohort should be performed to confirm the diagnostic potential and clinical application of these biomarkers.","2024","Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)"

However, few studies have comprehensively explored predictors of frailty and built predictive models. Therefore, our aim is to develop and evaluate a predictive model for frailty in middle-aged and elderly patients with colorectal cancer. From July 2023 to February 2024, a total of 502 middle-aged and elderly patients with colorectal cancer participated in this survey. Patients were randomly divided into training and validation groups in a 7:3 ratio. Univariate and multiple logistic regression analysis were employed to identify potential predictors of frailty in these patients. A nomogram was constructed based on the predictive factors, and the model underwent internal validation. In the training cohort, logistic regression revealed that self-perceived health, chronic pain, loneliness, depression, and health-promoting lifestyle were independent predictors of frailty. The Areas Under the Curve (AUC) of the training and validation groups were 0.845 and 0.851, respectively. The calibration curve of the nomogram demonstrated good consistency between predicted and actual probabilities. Decision curve analysis revealed good clinical benefit. This study established a predictive model with satisfactory predictive ability, providing empirical evidence for the early detection and intervention of frailty in middle-aged and elderly patients with colorectal cancer.

The effects of Helicobacter pylori (HP) infection on ESD and the potential benefits of preoperative eradication of HP remain unclear. The study aims to evaluate the impact of HP infection on bleeding and lesion detection during ESD in patients with EGC. We retrospectively analyzed 634 consecutive patients who underwent ESD for EGC at our center between January 2018 and January 2023. Logistic regression was used to assess the impact of HP infection status on intraoperative bleeding and lesion detection rates. We developed a predictive model based on selected indicators and evaluated its performance using the ROC curve. HP-positive patients experienced a higher rate of intraoperative bleeding (28.8%) compared with HP-negative patients (8.9%) (P < 0.001). HP-positive patients also had longer procedure time (median: 58.5 vs. 50.0 min, P < 0.001) and postoperative hospital stays (median: 4.35 vs. 4.07 days, P = 0.036). Multivariate analysis identified HP-positive (OR = 4.84), multiple lesions (OR = 1.81), specimen size > 40 mm (OR = 3.67), and submucosal invasion (OR = 2.27) as independent risk factors for intraoperative bleeding. The predictive model achieved an AUC of 0.807 (95%CI 0.761-0.852), with a sensitivity of 72.1% and specificity of 75.9%. Preoperative HP eradication was associated with an increased rate of lesion detection (OR = 2.82). Eradicating HP before ESD in patients with EGC reduces intraoperative bleeding and improves lesion detection. Preoperative HP eradication is therefore recommended in patients with EGC.","2024","Surgical endoscopy"

Assessment of its prognosis and genetic subtyping hold significant clinical implications. However, existing DLBCL prognostic models are mainly based on transcriptomic profiles, while genetic variation detection is more commonly used in clinical practice. In addition, current clustering-based subtyping methods mostly focus on genes with high mutation frequencies, providing insufficient explanations for the heterogeneity of DLBCL. Here, we proposed VNNSurv (https://bio-web1.nscc-gz.cn/app/VNNSurv), a survival model for DLBCL patients based on a biologically informed visible neural network (VNN). VNNSurv achieved an average C-index of 0.72 on the cross-validation set (HMRN cohort, n = 928), outperforming the baseline methods. The remarkable interpretability of VNNSurv facilitated the identification of the most impactful genes and the underlying pathways through which they act on patient outcomes. When only the 30 highest-impact genes were used as genetic input, the overall performance of VNNSurv improved, and a C-index of 0.70 was achieved on the external TCGA cohort (n = 48). Leveraging these high-impact genes, including 16 genes with low (<5 %) alteration frequencies, we devised a genetic-based prognostic index (GPI) for risk stratification and a subtype identification method. We stratified the patient group according to the International Prognostic Index (IPI) into three risk grades with significant prognostic differences. Furthermore, the defined subtypes exhibited greater prognostic consistency than clustering-based methods. Broadly, VNNSurv is a valuable DLBCL survival model. Its high interpretability has significant value for precision medicine, and its framework is scalable to other diseases.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

In this retrospective analysis, medical records of 99 individuals afflicted with NTM-PD and 285 individuals with PTB in Zhejiang Chinese and Western Medicine Integrated Hospital were examined. Random numbers generated by a computer were utilized to stratify the study cohort, with 80% designated as the training cohort and 20% as the validation cohort. A total of 2153 radiomics features were extracted using Python (Pyradiomics package) to analyse the CT characteristics of the large disease areas. The identification of significant factors was conducted through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The following four supervised learning classifier models were developed: random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression (LR), and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). For assessment and comparison of the predictive performance among these models, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) were employed. The Student's t-test, Levene test, and LASSO algorithm collectively selected 23 optimal features. ROC analysis was then conducted, with the respective AUC values of the XGBoost, LR, SVM, and RF models recorded to be 1, 0.9044, 0.8868, and 0.7982 in the training cohort. In the validation cohort, the respective AUC values of the XGBoost, LR, SVM, and RF models were 0.8358, 0.8085, 0.87739, and 0.7759. The DeLong test results noted the lack of remarkable variation across the models. The CT radiomics features can help distinguish between NTM-PD and PTB. Among the four classifiers, SVM showed a stable performance in effectively identifying these two diseases.","2024","Annals of medicine"

Neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratios (NLRs), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratios (PLRs) and lymphocyte-to-monocyte ratios (LMRs) have been reported to be sensitive measures of inflammatory reaction. This study aims to explore the value of these haematological makers in assessment of APR-negative RA patients. Out of a cohort of 418 consecutive patients with RA, we enrolled 135 patients with normal APR for this study. We performed ultrasound assessments to evaluate synovitis and bone erosion in the affected joints. Synovitis was evaluated by ultrasound grey scale (GS) and power Doppler (PD) with semi-quantitative scoring (0-3). Demographic, clinical and laboratory data were collected from the patients. Disease Activity Score-28 joints (DAS28), NLR, MLR and PLR were calculated. In RA patients with normal APR, PLR exhibited a positive correlation with ultrasound-detected synovitis and bone erosion, whereas NLR, MLR showed no significant correlation with ultrasonography parameters. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for identifying synovitis with a GS grade ≥2 based on a PLR cutoff value of ≥159.6 was 0.7868 (sensitivity: 80.95%, specificity: 74.24%). For synovitis with a PD grade ≥2, the AUC was 0.7690, using a PLR cutoff value of ≥166.1 (sensitivity: 68.0%, specificity: 83.87%). Our findings suggested that PLR might be a reliable and cost-effective marker for identifying moderate-to-severe synovitis in RA patients with normal APR.","2024","Annals of medicine"

Besides, obstructive sleep apnea hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), a driver of atherosclerosis (AS), can exacerbate metabolic disturbances strongly. The aim of this study is to explore the mediating effect of glycolipid metabolism on the association between OSAHS and arterial stiffness in T2DM patients. 154 T2DM patients were involved in this study and were split into two groups: T2DM and T2DM + AS. Logistic regression analysis determined the accurate effects of different factors on the AS of T2DM patients. The capacity of TyG and the indices it derives to predict AS was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Mediation analysis was employed to investigate the mediating effect of TyG and its derived indices on the association between OSAHS and arterial stiffness in T2DM patients. OSAHS, TyG, and its derived indices were independent risk factors for AS in T2DM patients. Stratified by age, the hazardous effects of TyG and its derived indices remained significant in T2DM patients aged ≥ 50 years, but not in those aged < 50 years. In T2DM patients aged ≥ 50 years, the novel indices have a high predictive value for AS, with TyG-BMI exhibiting the largest AUC(AUC:0.788;95% CI:0.647 ∼ 0.928; P < 0.001). The mediation analysis results indicated that in T2DM patients aged ≥ 50 years, TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR acted as potential mediators in the association between OSAHS and AS, with mediation effects of 33.42%, 48.2%, 37.7%, and 40.21%, respectively. However, there was no significant mediating effect observed in the younger patients. TyG and its derived indices are strongly correlated with AS in T2DM patients, of which TyG-BMI has the best predictive performance. Besides, OSAHS partially exerts its atherogenic effect through glucolipid metabolism disorder in the T2DM population aged ≥ 50 years, while it mainly exerts a direct atherogenic effect in patients aged < 50 years.","2024","Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung"

This study evaluates the prognostic utility of the albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) score compared to the traditional Child-Pugh (CP) grading, leveraging real-world evidence from a large-scale, multi-center database. The Liver Cancer IN Korea (LINK) research network, a multi-center initiative, retrospectively collected electronic health records from three academic hospitals in South Korea, encompassing HCC patients diagnosed between 2015 and 2020. Inclusion criteria mandated at least one HCC treatment and excluded patients with other primary cancer diagnoses. The study followed patients until death, the last visit, or June 2021, employing standardized data processing and rule-based algorithms for data consistency. The prognostic efficacy of ALBI scores and CP scores was compared through time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the inverse probability censoring weighting method. From 25,248 newly diagnosed patients, 10,297 were included, with 65.82% having hepatitis B etiology and a mean follow-up of 27.49 months. Patients' classification by modified ALBI (mALBI) grade at diagnosis revealed: grade 1 (48.87%), 2a (20.50%), 2b (24.54%), and 3 (5.17%), with a minimal percentage missing (0.92%). Transarterial therapy (54.07%) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (84.14% as the first-line systemic therapy) were predominant treatments. The ALBI score demonstrated greater prognostic efficacy than the CP score in long-term outcomes, with time-dependent area under the ROC curve analysis showing a score of 0.71 for ALBI versus 0.67 for CP at 60 months. Furthermore, higher mALBI grades were significantly associated with poorer survival outcomes, as indicated by both univariate and multivariate Cox proportional regression model analyses (p < 0.001). The study confirmed the ALBI score's superior prognostic ability over the CP score, especially evident in long-term outcomes, suggesting a shift toward more nuanced liver function assessment tools in real-world clinical practice.","2024","Liver cancer"

This study aimed to determine whether 18F-FDG PET imaging provides incremental prognostic information for predicting major adverse cardiac events (MACEs) compared to clinical risk factors, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score, and coronary artery calcium score (CACS) in patients with suspected UA. In this post hoc analysis of a prospective study, 265 patients suspected with UA (62.3% male, mean age: 65.0±9.4 years) were enrolled. 18F-FDG positivity was defined as focal or focal on diffuse uptake patterns. MACEs included cardiovascular death, acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, rehospitalization for UA, and stroke. Multivariable Cox regression was used to identify predictors of MACEs, and the incremental prognostic value of 18F-FDG PET imaging was assessed using the Concordance Index (C-index), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Over a median follow-up of 25 months, 51 patients (19.2%) experienced MACEs. 18F-FDG positivity (hazard ratio [HR]=3.220, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.630-6.360, P<.001), as well as 18F-FDG standardized uptake ratio (HR=1.330, 95% CI: 1.131-1.564, P=.0006) and Extent (HR=1.045, 95% CI: 1.028-1.062, P<.0001), were independent predictors of MACE. The addition of 18F-FDG PET imaging significantly improved risk stratification beyond clinical factors, the GRACE score, and CACS, with improved C-index (.769 vs .688, P=.045), NRI (.324, P=.020), and IDI (.055, P=.027). 18F-FDG PET myocardial ischemic memory imaging significantly improves prognostic assessment for patients with suspected UA, providing valuable additional risk stratification beyond clinical risk factors, GRACE score, and CACS.","2024","Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology"

However, there can be substantial variability in efficacy, and we lack adequate biomarkers to predict individual response. We thus aimed to identify transcriptomic profiles in nasal respiratory epithelium that predict clinical response to ETI treatment. We obtained nasal epithelial samples from pwCF before ETI initiation and performed a transcriptome-wide analysis of baseline gene expression to predict changes in forced expiratory volume in 1 second (ΔFEV1), year's best FEV1 (ΔybFEV1), and body mass index (ΔBMI). Using the top differentially expressed genes, we generated transcriptomic risk scores (TRSs) and evaluated their predictive performance. The study included 40 pwCF ≥6 years of age (mean, 27.7 [SD, 15.1] years; 40% female). After ETI initiation, FEV1 improved by ≥5% in 22 (61.1%) participants, and ybFEV1 improved by ≥5% in 19 (50%). TRSs were constructed using top overexpressed and underexpressed genes for each outcome. Adding the ΔFEV1 TRS to a model with age, sex, and baseline FEV1 increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) from 0.41 to 0.88, the ΔybFEV1 TRS increased the AUC from 0.51 to 0.88, and the ΔBMI TRS increased the AUC from 0.46 to 0.92. Average accuracy was thus ∼85% in predicting the response to the three outcomes. Results were similar in models further adjusted for F508del zygosity and previous CFTR modulator use. In conclusion, we identified nasal epithelial transcriptomic profiles that help accurately predict changes in FEV1 and BMI with ETI treatment. These novel TRSs could serve as predictive biomarkers for clinical response to modulator treatment in pwCF.","2024","American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology"

Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was performed on all subjects and both static and dynamic ReHo were used to detect local functional connectivity. We then tested the relationship between altered brain regions, disease duration, and clinical scales. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to reveal the potential capability of these indicators to screen CI patients from HCs. CI showed increased dynamic ReHo in the right precuneus and decreased static ReHo in the right cerebellum_6. The dynamic ReHo values of the right precuneus were negatively correlated with the self-rating depression score and the static ReHo values of the right cerebellum_6 were positively correlated with the Montreal Cognitive Assessment-Naming score. In addition, the combination of the two metrics showed a potential capacity to distinguish CI patients from HCs, which was better than a single metric alone. The present study has revealed the altered local functional connectivity under static and temporal dynamic conditions in patients with CI, and found the relationships between these changes, mood-related scales, and cognitive-related scales.

We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE and CINAHL for studies of prognostic risk prediction models for acute post-surgical pain using predetermined criteria. Prediction model performance was evaluated according to discrimination and calibration. Adherence to TRIPOD guidelines was assessed. Risk of bias and applicability was independently assessed by two reviewers using the prediction model risk of bias assessment tool. We included 14 studies reporting on 17 prediction models. The most common predictors identified in final prediction models included age; surgery type; sex or gender; anxiety or fear of surgery; pre-operative pain intensity; pre-operative analgesic use; pain catastrophising; and expected surgical incision size. Discrimination, measured by the area under receiver operating characteristic curves or c-statistic, ranged from 0.61 to 0.83. Calibration was only reported for seven models. The median (IQR [range]) overall adherence rate to TRIPOD items was 62 (53-66 [47-72])%. All prediction models were at high risk of bias.

This was a retrospective study of pediatric patients exposed to a doxorubicin isotoxic equivalent dose of ≥ 225 mg/m2. Transthoracic echocardiograms (TTE) were obtained prior to chemotherapy (T1), during anthracycline therapy (T2), and following completion of therapy (T3). Cardiotoxicity was defined as meeting at least one of the following criteria after anthracycline therapy: a decrease in left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF) by 10% from baseline to a value < 55%, fractional shortening < 28%, or a decrease in GLS by ≥ 15% from baseline. Nineteen of 57 (33%) patients met criteria for cardiotoxicity at T3. Cardiotoxicity was associated with a lower LVEF at T2 (p = 0.0003) and a decrease in GLS by ≥ 15% at T2 compared to baseline (p =  < 0.0001). ROC analysis revealed that the best predictor of cardiotoxicity at T3 was the percent change in GLS at T2 compared to baseline (AUC 0.87). A subgroup analysis revealed that a decrease in GLS by ≥ 15% from baseline at 0-6 months from completion of anthracycline therapy was associated with cardiotoxicity > 1-year post-treatment (p = 0.017).

The aim of this study was to analyze the role of auxiliary general biomarkers in verifying low alkaline phosphatase (ALP) serum activity level as an alert parameter for PNVs in the ALPLgene, which are indicative of HPP. In this retrospective analysis, we examined adult patients with an ALP serum activity level below 21 U/L. The cohort comprised 88 patients with temporary HPE (tHPE group) and 20 patients with persistent HPE who underwent re-examination. Genetic analysis performed on 12 pHPE patients identified PNV in the ALPLgene in 11 cases (ALPL group). Hemoglobin [HB], aspartate aminotransferase [AST], gamma-glutamyl transferase [GGT], calcium, phosphate, thyrotropin [TSH], albumin, total protein, and C-reactive protein [CRP] levels represented basic biomarkers. A comparative analysis between groups employed a Student's t-test, and a Student's t-test with bootstrap sampling (n = 10.000) was performed. Results: The mean HB, ALP, calcium, albumin, and total protein levels were lower in the tHPE group compared with the ALPL group (p < 0.01). AST and CRP were increased in the tHPE group (p < 0.01). The model showed an accuracy of 90% and an AUC of 0.94, which means that it can discern the two groups ~94% of the time. Conclusions: Basic biomarker evaluation effectively supports the interpretation of a decreased ALP serum activity level in the context of suspected HPP.

However, achieving a definitive pathogenic classification remains challenging, with most missense variants still classified as variants of uncertain significance (VUS) and with the availability of many computational tools which may provide conflicting predictions. Here, we aim to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art computational tools in pathogenicity prediction of missense variants in epilepsy-associated genes. This will assist in selecting the most appropriate tool and critically assess their use in clinical setting. We assessed the performance of nine in silico pathogenicity prediction tools for missense variants in epilepsy-associated genes on three carefully curated data sets. The first two data sets comprise missense variants in epilepsy associated genes that have been uploaded to ClinVar in the last year and were, therefore, not part of the training set of any of the nine considered tools. These two data sets are based on two different lists of epilepsy-associated genes and comprise ~700 and ~ 250 missense variants, respectively. The third data set includes ~400 missense variants within epilepsy-associated genes for which the functional effects have been determined experimentally and are therefore used here to infer pathogenicity. These three data sets represent the best available approximation to blind and independent test sets. Among the nine assessed tools, AlphaMissense (area under the curve [AUC]: .93, .88, and .95) and REVEL (AUC: .93, .88, and .93) showed the best classification performance, also outperforming other tools in the number of classified variants. We show which recently developed prediction tools achieve higher performance in epilepsy-associated genes and should be integrated, therefore, into the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics/Association of Molecular Pathology (AGMC/AMP) variant classification process. Periodic reevaluation of genetic test results with newly developed or updated tools should be incorporated into standard clinical practice to improve diagnostic yield and better inform precision medicine.","2024","Epilepsia"

To develop and validate a score to predict fibrostenosis in EoE patients prior to endoscopy. We leveraged a large database of newly diagnosed EoE patients. Fibrostenosis was defined as esophageal stricture, luminal narrowing, or dilation performed during the diagnostic endoscopy. Patients were randomly divided into a development and validation set. We compared features between patients with and without fibrostenosis to inform the initial model and assess predictive ability, as measured by area under curve (AUC). We tested the model in the independent validation set and generated a score to predict low, medium and high fibrostenosis risk. In 655 newly diagnosed EoE patients in the development set, fibrostenosis was associated with age ≥ 18 years (OR 10.64; 95% CI 5.61-20.17), symptoms for ≥ 5 years prior to diagnosis (OR 2.07; 1.32-3.24), dysphagia (OR 3.72; 1.68-8.22), food impaction (OR 1.68; 1.07-2.62), and lack of abdominal pain (OR 0.28; 0.14-0.60). The model predicted fibrostenosis (AUC = 0.841). In the validation set (n = 654), AUC was preserved (0.831). A scoring system was generated, with scores of ≤ 2 being low risk (< 10% chance of stricture), 2.5-4.5 medium risk (10-50% stricture), and 5-6 high risk (> 50%). We developed and validated the PICK-UP-STRICS score to increase suspicion and detection of fibrostenotic disease in EoE using readily available clinical features prior to endoscopy. This score may guide clinical decisions on the need of endoscopic dilation.","2025","Digestive diseases and sciences"

Patients treated with BI 409306 were recruited from two Phase II randomized, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia (NCT03351244) and attenuated psychotic disorders (NCT03230097). A machine-learning model was optimized to predict overall trial adherence using AiCure data collected over three monitoring periods (7/10/14 days), adherence cut-offs (0.6/0.7/0.8) and timepoints (Start/Mid/End). Area under the curve (AUC), false negative rate, and false omission rate averaged across 10 model cross-validations were analyzed. In NCT03351244, post hoc analyses compared time to first relapse in patients observed as adherent versus those predicted adherent by the model. Of 235 patients, 60.4 % demonstrated ≥80 % adherence. At an adherence cut-off of 0.8, the 14-day model performed best (AUC: 0.81 versus 0.79 [10-day], 0.77 [7-day]). Within the 14-day model, 0.6 cut-off was optimal (AUC: 0.87 versus 0.85 [0.7 cut-off], 0.81 [0.8 cut-off]). The Trial-End timepoint yielded the most accurate prediction (AUC: 0.92 versus 0.87 [Start], 0.85 [Mid]). Despite NCT03351244 not meeting the primary endpoint, a reduction in risk of first relapse with BI 409306 versus placebo was observed when analyzed with adherent completers (≥80 % across trial; HR = 0.485) and patients with predicted adherence ≥60 % (HR = 0.510). Adherence data with longer monitoring durations (14 days), lower adherence cut-offs (0.6), and later timepoints (Trial-End) produced most accurate adherence predictions. Accurate adherence prediction provides insights about medication adherence patterns that may help clinicians improve individual adherence.","2025","Schizophrenia research"

Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), among other nonmalignant cells in the TME, promote an immunosuppressive environment, fostering tumor cell survival, proliferation, and resistance. Hence, combining chemotherapy with immunomodulatory agents to transition TAMs to an immunostimulatory phenotype holds immense therapeutic potential. The present study focuses on developing tumor-responsive nanoparticles (NPs) for combined chemo-immunotherapy using resiquimod (RSQ), a TLR 7/8 agonist as an immunomodulator, and paclitaxel (PTX) as chemotherapeutics. A pH-responsive NP known as PHNP, tailored with a star-shaped PLGA conjugated with poly histidine, was engineered to selectively deliver a consistent ratio of PTX and RSQ directly to the tumor site. In vitro studies demonstrate enhanced drug release at pH 6.4, increased penetration in tumor spheroids, and increased cytotoxic efficacy against breast cancer cells. Furthermore, PHNPs activate macrophages for antitumor activity. In vivo studies demonstrated a notable rise in plasma AUC and improved delivery of drugs to the tumor using PHNPs, resulting in enhanced effectiveness against tumor growth in a mouse orthotopic breast cancer model. Notably, PHNP treatment elevated intratumoral ROS and apoptosis levels and inhibited lung metastasis. Overall, this study underscores the potential of the PTX and RSQ combination as a prospective combined chemo-immunotherapeutic modality.","2024","Molecular pharmaceutics"

We utilized baseline 18F-FDG-PET/CT scans from patients newly diagnosed with oropharyngeal or hypopharyngeal cancer. The study cohort comprised 162 patients for training and 32 for validation, all of whom completed definitive chemoradiotherapy or radiotherapy for organ-preservation. Following image augmentation, fused PET and CT images were used to train three distinct DL models. An ensemble voting classifier was then employed to predict local recurrence (LR), neck lymph node relapse (NR), and distant metastases (DM). Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. With a median follow-up of 36 months, the training cohort experienced, LR in 45 (27.8 %), NR in 32 (19.8 %), and DM in 21 (13.0 %) patients.

Right ventricular longitudinal strain (RVLS) is primarily used in evaluating right ventricular (RV) systolic function. This study aimed to investigate the association of the changes in segmental and global RVLS with neonatal PH, hoping to provide a new marker for indicating neonatal PH other than obtaining information on RV function. This was a cross-sectional study with 62 neonates, generally divided into PH and non-PH groups confirmed by echocardiography. For 30 infants later diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), specific analysis was conducted by subdividing them into BPD with and without PH subgroups. Conventional echocardiography markers and the global and segmental RVLS were measured and compared. Their diagnostic performance in evaluating PH was analyzed. Regardless of grouping, the biventricular function of all infants was similar and in normal range. No significant difference was found in global strain parameters, either. In the case of PH, tricuspid regurgitant velocity (TRV), left ventricle systolic eccentricity index (LVsEI), and the basal-to-apical strain ratio (Ratio bas/api) of RV free wall (RVFW) were significantly higher (P < 0.001, P < 0.05, P < 0.05). By contrast, the magnitude of apical segmental strain reduced significantly (P < 0.05) and was significantly lower than that of basal segmental strain in BPD with PH subgroup (P = 0.024). The area under the curve values for Ratio bas/api was highest (0.846), followed by LVsEI (0.746) and apical segmental strain (0.272). As a relatively standardized parameter, Ratio bas/api of RVFW was significantly higher in the case of neonatal PH with normal cardiac function and could be regarded as a new indicator for PH. • It has been challenging work to diagnose neonatal pulmonary hypertension (PH), and conventional echocardiography has been widely applied, though it is not sufficient enough. • RV longitudinal strain (RVLS) is primarily used to assess RV systolic function, and its role in diagnosing PH was rarely considered. • The basal-to-apical strain ratio (Ratio bas/api) of RV free wall increased significantly in all infants with PH regardless of causes. • As a relatively standardized parameter, Ratio bas/api could be regarded as a new indicator for diagnosing PH, apart from conventional echocardiographic parameters.","2024","European journal of pediatrics"

This retrospective study included 416 patients with ESCC who received ICI plus chemotherapy at two independent hospitals between January 2019 and July 2022. Multiparametric CT features were extracted from ESCC lesions and screened using hierarchical clustering and dimensionality reduction algorithms. Logistic regression and machine learning models based on selected features were developed to predict treatment response and validated in separate datasets. ITH was quantified using the score calculated by the best-performing model and visualized through feature clustering and feature contribution heatmaps. A gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was performed to identify the biological pathways underlying the CT-based ITH. The extreme gradient boosting model based on CT-derived ITH had higher discriminative power, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.864 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.774-0.954) and 0.796 (95% CI: 0.698-0.893) in the internal and external validation sets. The CT-based ITH pattern differed significantly between responding and non-responding patients. The GSEA indicated that CT-based ITH was associated with immunity-, keratinization-, and epidermal cell differentiation-related pathways. CT-based ITH is an effective biomarker for identifying patients with ESCC who could benefit from ICI plus chemotherapy.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of radiomic features extracted from ultrasound (US) images combined with machine learning (ML) methods in predicting ALNM to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient prognosis. In this retrospective study, data of 282 early-stage breast cancer patients from two centers were analyzed. We considered clinicopathological characteristics, conventional US features, contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) characteristics, and radiomics features. Radiomics features were extracted from US images, and using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, 12 key features were selected to compute a Radiomics score (Rad-score). A nomogram was developed based on these features, alongside five ML models: Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), Support Vector Machine (SVM), K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Model performance was evaluated using metrics such as the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), negative predictive value (NPV), and positive predictive value (PPV). Both the nomogram and ML models, including the Rad-score combined with histologic type, significantly predicted ALNM. Among all models, the XGBoost model showed the best performance with an AUC of 0.810 and an accuracy of 84.1% in the external test set, surpassing the nomogram and other ML models. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis further provided insights into the influence of individual radiomics features on ALNM prediction.

In this study, PRx is validated in a porcine cranial window model, developed to visualize pial arteriolar autoregulation and its limits. We measured arterial blood pressure, intracranial pressure, pial arteriolar diameter, and red blood cell (RBC) velocity in a closed cranial window piglet model during gradual balloon catheter-induced arterial hypotension (n = 10) or hypertension (n = 10). CA limits were derived through piecewise linear regression of calculated RBC flux vs cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), leading for each arteriole to 1 lower limit of autoregulation (LLA) and 2 upper limits of autoregulation (ULA1 and ULA2). Autoregulation limits were compared with PRx thresholds, and receiver operating curve analysis was performed with and without CPP binning. A linear mixed effects model of PRx was performed. Receiver operating curve analysis indicated an area under the curve (AUC) for LLA prediction by a PRx of 0.65 (95% CI: 0.64-0.67) and 0.77 (95% CI: 0.69-0.86) without and with CPP binning, respectively. The AUC for ULA1 prediction by PRx was 0.69 (95% CI: 0.68-0.69) without and 0.75 (95% CI: 0.68-0.82) with binning. The AUC for ULA2 prediction was 0.55 (95% CI: 0.55-0.58) without and 0.63 (95% CI 0.53-0.72) with binning. The sensitivity and specificity of binned PRx were 65%/90% for LLA, 69%/71% for ULA1, and 59%/74% for ULA2, showing wide interindividual variability. In the linear mixed effects model, pial arteriolar diameter changes were significantly associated with PRx changes ( P = .002), whereas RBC velocity ( P = .28) and RBC flux ( P = .24) were not. We conclude that PRx is predominantly determined by pial arteriolar diameter changes and moderately predicts CA limits. Performance to detect the CA limits varied highly on an individual level. Active therapeutic strategies based on PRx and the associated correlation metrics should incorporate these limitations.","2024","Neurosurgery"

Consecutive patients with suspected HCC who underwent multi-b-value DWI examinations were prospectively collected. Quantitative parameters from vMRE, mono-exponential, intravoxel incoherent motion, and diffusion kurtosis imaging models were obtained. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify independent MVI predictors and build prediction models. A combined MRI_Score was constructed using independent quantitative parameters. A visualized nomogram was built based on significant CR features and MRI_Score. The predictive performance of quantitative parameters and models was evaluated. The study included 103 patients (median age: 56 years; range: 35-70 years; 87 males and 16 females). Diffusion-based shear modulus (μDiff) exhibited a predictive performance for MVI with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.735. The MRI_Score was developed employing true diffusion coefficient (D), mean kurtosis (MK), and μDiff. CR model and MRI_Score achieved AUCs of 0.787 and 0.840, respectively. The combined nomogram based on AFP, corona enhancement, tumor capsule, TTPVI, and MRI_Score significantly improved the predictive performance to an AUC of 0.931 (Delong test p < 0.05). vMRE exhibited great potential for predicting MVI in BCLC stage A HCC. The combined nomogram integrating CR features, vMRE, and quantitative diffusion parameters significantly improved the predictive accuracy and could potentially assist clinicians in identifying appropriate treatment options.","2024","Academic radiology"

Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) is a validated, simple, and non-invasive tool for assessing nutritional status. Despite its potential, no study has explored the association between MUAC and physical frailty in older adults. This study aims to investigate this association and assess whether MUAC can be used as a screening tool in community and primary clinical practice. A cross-sectional study was conducted with 1178 participants aged 71.8 to 86.7 years from the 2019 Korean Frailty and Aging Cohort Study (KFACS). Physical frailty was defined using the Fried frailty phenotype criteria. MUAC was measured as the average circumference of both upper arms without compressing the subcutaneous tissue. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for physical frailty, stratified by sex, were estimated using multiple logistic regression analysis after adjustments. MUAC was lower in physically frail men compared with non-frail men (28.0 ± 2.9 vs. 29.4 ± 2.6 cm, P < 0.001). MUAC was negatively correlated with the Frailty Index (r = -0.155, P < 0.001). Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that MUAC was an independent factor for physical frailty in men (OR  0.986, 95% CI  0.973-1.000, P = 0.049). The optimal MUAC cutoff for identifying physical frailty in men was 28.2 cm (sensitivity 60.7%, specificity 71.4%, AUC  0.672, 95% CI 0.595-0.749, P < 0.001). No significant results were found for women. Low MUAC is significantly associated with physical frailty in older men, suggesting the potential for MUAC to be utilized as a screening tool for physical frailty in community and primary clinical settings.

The purpose of this study was to identify factors independently associated with prolonged tube feeding in adult inpatients who required intubation and mechanical ventilation. Retrospective observational cohort study in a dataset of 1.3 million inpatients. Extubated adults without preventilation dysphagia or tube feeding who underwent instrumental swallowing assessment were included. To characterize factors independently associated with prolonged tube feeding, we compiled a set of potential factors, completed factor selection using a random forest algorithm, and performed logistic regression. In total, 206 of 987 (20.9%) patients had prolonged tube feeding. The regression model produced an area under the curve of 0.79. Factors with the greatest influence on prolonged tube feeding included dysphagia with thickened liquids, dysphagia with soft/solid foods, preadmission weight loss, number of intubations, admission for neurologic disorder, and hospital of admission. Several factors predicted prolonged tube feeding after extubation. The strongest were some, but not all, aspects of swallowing function and clinical practice pattern variability. Clinical decision-making should consider bolus-specific data from instrumental swallowing evaluation rather than binary presence or absence of dysphagia.","2024","Journal of intensive care medicine"

We sought to develop the Preoperative Recurrence Score (PRS), a model to estimate the risk of early recurrence after resection based on preoperative radiological characteristics. Data of patients who underwent surgery for PCC were retrospectively collected, and preoperative imaging was reviewed to assess tumor characteristics. A model to assess the risk of early recurrence based on preoperative radiologic characteristics was internally developed and externally validated on two cohorts of patients from two European major hepatobiliary surgery referral centers. A total of 215 patients among three different patient cohorts were included in the study. Tumor size ≥18 mm (HR 2.70, 95 % CI 1.48-4.92, p = 0.001), macroscopic portal vein involvement (HR 2.28, 95%CI 1.19-4.34, p = 0.013), hepatic arteries involvement (HR 2.44, 95%CI 1.26-4.71, p = 0.008), and presence of suspicious lymph nodes (HR 1.98, 95%CI 1.02-3.83, p = 0.043) were significantly associated with recurrence-free survival (RFS). The model showed excellent discrimination both on the internal (AUC 0.83) and external validation cohorts (external 1: AUC 0.84; external 2: AUC 0.70). High PRS was associated with worse RFS among all three cohorts, with a 1-year recurrence probability of 80.1 %, 100.0 %, and 54.2 % in the internal and external validation cohorts 1 and 2, respectively. The PRS is a simple tool that can accurately assess the risk of early recurrence in patients with PCC.

The data of 183 patients with 281 LNs were analyzed. The targeted LNs were negative or equivocal on small FOV CT images. Six deep-learning models were used to classify the LNs on conventional CT images. The performance of all models was compared with pathology reports. Of the 281 LNs, 65.5% had a short diameter of less than 4 mm. Multiple quantitative dual-energy CT parameters significantly differed between benign and malignant LNs. Multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that the best combination of parameters had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.857, with excellent consistency and discrimination, and its diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity were 74.4% and 84.2%, respectively (p < 0.001). The visual geometry group 16 (VGG16) based model achieved the best accuracy (86%) and sensitivity (88%) in differentiating between benign and malignant LNs, with an AUC of 0.89. The VGG16 model based on small FOV CT images showed better diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity than the spectral parameter model. Our study presents a noninvasive and convenient imaging biomarker to predict malignant LNs without suspicious CT features in thyroid cancer patients. Our study presents a deep-learning-based model to predict malignant lymph nodes in thyroid cancer without suspicious features on conventional CT images, which shows better diagnostic accuracy and sensitivity than the regression model based on spectral parameters.

One of the most common and feared complications of esophagectomy is anastomotic leakage (AL). Our work aimed to develop a multimodal machine-learning model combining CT-derived and clinical data for predicting AL following esophagectomy for esophageal cancer. A total of 471 patients were prospectively included (Jan 2010-Dec 2022). Preoperative computed tomography (CT) was used to evaluate celia trunk stenosis and vessel calcification. Clinical variables, including demographics, disease stage, operation details, postoperative CRP, and stage, were combined with CT data to build a model for AL prediction. Data was split into 80%:20% for training and testing, and an XGBoost model was developed with 10-fold cross-validation and early stopping. ROC curves and respective areas under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and F1-scores were calculated. A total of 117 patients (24.8%) exhibited post-operative AL.

The TCGA database's clinical data and transcriptome profiles were employed. Analysis of previous studies identified 10 disulfidptosis-related genes (DRGs). We used these genes to construct a signature that could independently and accurately predict the prognosis of patients with COAD. The Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curve analysis showed that the lower-risk group had a better prognosis. With the help of multivariate Cox regression analysis, the risk score produced from the patient's signature might independently predict the outcomes. Utilizing a nomogram, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and principal component analysis (PCA), the signature's predictive ability was also confirmed. It's interesting to note that immunotherapy, especially PD-1 immune checkpoint suppression, was more likely to benefit low-risk patients. The IC50 levels for certain anticancer agents were lower in the high-risk group. Finally, qRT-PCR analyses in colon cancer cell lines revealed elevated levels of lncRNAs CASC9, ZEB1-AS1, ATP2A1-AS1, SNHG7, AL683813.1, and AP003555.1, and reduced levels of FAM160A1-DT and AC112220.2, compared to normal cell lines.

Currently, there is no reliable prediction model for long-term prognosis in ACLF. This study aimed to develop and validate a prognostic model incorporating inflammation indexes to predict the long-term outcome of patients with hepatitis B virus-related ACLF (HBV-ACLF). A retrospective analysis of clinical data from HBV-ACLF patients (n = 986) treated at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between January 2014 and December 2018 was conducted. Patients were randomly divided into training (n = 690) and validation (n = 296) cohorts. The Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) and Cox regression analyses were used to identify independent risk factors for long-term mortality. The following variables were identified as independent predictors of long-term mortality: age, cirrhosis, hepatic encephalopathy, total bilirubin (TBIL), international normalized ratio (INR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR). A novel nomogram was established by assigning weights to each variable. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.777 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.752-0.802). In the training set, the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting mortality at 1, 3, and 12 months was 0.841 (95% CI: 0.807-0.875), 0.827 (95% CI: 0.796-0.859), and 0.829 (95% CI: 0.798-0.859), respectively.

Over recent years, a multitude of deep learning-based approaches have emerged to tackle this challenging task, leading to significant advancements. However, the 'black-box' nature of deep learning models and the considerable interpatient variability significantly impede their interpretability and generalization, thereby severely hampering their efficacy in real-world clinical applications. To address these issues, our study aims to establish an interpretable and generalizable seizure prediction model that meets the demands of clinical diagnosis. Our method extends self-interpretable prototype learning networks into a novel domain adaptation framework designed specifically for cross-patient seizure prediction. The proposed framework enables patient-level interpretability by tracing the origins of significant prototypes. For instance, it could provide information about the seizure type of the patient to which the prototype belongs. This surpasses the existing sample-level interpretability, which is limited to individual patient samples. To further improve the model's generalization capability, we introduce a contrastive semantic alignment loss constraint to the embedding space, enhancing the robustness of the learned prototypes. We evaluate our proposed model using the Freiburg intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) dataset, which consists of 20 patients and a total of 82 seizures. The experimental results demonstrated a high sensitivity of 79.0%, a low false prediction rate of 0.183, and a high area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value of 0.804, achieving state-of-the-art performance with self-interpretable evidence in contrast to the current cross-patient seizure prediction methods.

In this multicentre retrospective study, we collected data for patients with lung cancer who had a biopsy and multigene next-generation sequencing done at 16 hospitals in China (with no restrictions on age, sex, or histology type), to form a large multicentre dataset comprising paired pathological image and multiple gene mutation information. We also included patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) publicly available dataset. Our developed model is an instance-level and bag-level co-supervised multiple instance learning method with label disambiguation design. We trained and initially tested the DeepGEM model on the internal dataset (patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China), and further evaluated it on the external dataset (patients from the remaining 15 centres) and the public TCGA dataset. Additionally, a dataset of patients from the same medical centre as the internal dataset, but without overlap, was used to evaluate the model's generalisation ability to biopsy samples from lymph node metastases. The primary objective was the performance of the DeepGEM model in predicting gene mutations (area under the curve [AUC] and accuracy) in the four prespecified groups (ie, the hold-out internal test set, multicentre external test set, TCGA set, and lymph node metastases set). Assessable pathological images and multigene testing information were available for 3697 patients who had biopsy and multigene next-generation sequencing done between Jan 1, 2018, and March 31, 2022, at the 16 centres.

Using computed tomography (CT) imaging of 234 stage I-IIIA LUAD patients derived from three public multicenter cohorts, we proposed a rank-based method that utilized the relative rank patterns of quantitative values between radiomic feature pairs within individual patients and established a feature pair signature for LUAD prognosis. We collected a new clinical cohort with 162 LUAD patients for independent validation. A rank-based radiomic signature, consisting of 12 feature pairs, was developed, and it could determine the mortality risk for an individual according to the rank patterns of 12 feature pairs within the patient's CT imaging. The prognostic performance of the rank-based signature was effectively validated in the new clinical cohort (log-rank P = 0.0051, C-index = 0.73), whereas other signatures lost their prognostic ability across centers. The novel proposed radiomic nomogram significantly improved the prognostic performance of clinicopathological factors. The further radiogenomic analyses revealed the underlying biological characteristics (e.g., Stemness, Ferroptosis, 'ECM') reflected by the rank-based radiomic signature. This multicenter study illustrates the accuracy and stability of the rank-based radiomic signature for LUAD prognosis, and demonstrates a unique advantage of clinical individualized application. The biological characteristics underlying the rank-based radiomic signature would accelerate its clinical application.","2024","European journal of radiology"

This retrospective study included 127 patients who underwent primary surgical resection for HCC between October 2019 and November 2021. The patients were subsequently divided into training and validation sets (7:3 ratio). All patients received preoperative routine ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound examination, with postoperative pathological confirmation of HCC. Radiomics features were extracted from maximum section of a two-dimensional ultrasound image. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operation logistic regression algorithm with 10-fold cross-validation was used to establish ultrasonic radiomics features. Logistic regression modelling was used to build models based on clinical and ultrasonic features (model 1, clinical-ultrasonic model), radiomics signature (model 2, ultrasonic radiomics model), and the combination (model 3, clinical-ultrasonic-radiomics model). Then, a nomogram model was established to predict the risk of early recurrence, and the application value of nomogram through internal verification was evaluated. Model 3 showed optimal diagnostic performance in both training set (area under the curve [AUC], 0.907) and validation set (AUC, 0.925), followed by the model 1 in training set (AUC, 0.846) and validation set (AUC, 0.855), both above two models performed better than model 2 in training set (AUC, 0.751) and validation set (AUC, 0.702) (p < 0.05). In the training set and validation set of model 3, the sensitivity were 83.3%, 77.8%, the specificity ware 95.8%, 100.0% and the C-index were 0.791, 0.778. The preoperative clinical-ultrasonic-radiomics model is anticipated to be a reliable tool for predicting the early recurrence of surgical resection of HCC.","2024","Ultrasound in medicine & biology"

Single-omics analyses are far from elucidating the complex mechanisms of lipid metabolic dysfunction in OA. This study identified a shared lipid metabolic signature of OA by integrating metabolomics, single-cell and bulk RNA-seq, as well as metagenomics. Compared to the normal counterparts, cartilagesin OA patients exhibited significant depletion of homeostatic chondrocytes (HomCs) (P = 0.03) and showed lipid metabolic disorders in linoleic acid metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism which was consistent with our findings obtained from plasma metabolomics. Through high-dimensional weighted gene co-expression network analysis (hdWGCNA), weidentified PLA2G2A as a hub gene associated with lipid metabolic disorders in HomCs. And an OA-associated subtype of HomCs, namely HomC1 (marked by PLA2G2A, MT-CO1, MT-CO2, and MT-CO3) was identified, which also exhibited abnormal activation of lipid metabolic pathways. This suggests the involvement of HomC1 in OA progression through the shared lipid metabolism aberrancies, which were further validated via bulk RNA-Seq analysis. Metagenomic profiling identified specific gut microbial species significantly associated with the key lipid metabolism disorders, including Bacteroides uniformis (P < 0.001, R = -0.52), Klebsiella pneumonia (P = 0.003, R = 0.42), Intestinibacter_bartlettii (P = 0.009, R = 0.38), and Streptococcus anginosus (P = 0.009, R = 0.38). By integrating the multi-omics features, a random forest diagnostic model with outstanding performance was developed (AUC = 0.97). In summary, this study deciphered the crucial role of a integrated lipid metabolic signature in OA pathogenesis, and established a regulatory axis of gut microbiota-metabolites-cell-gene, providing new insights into the gut-joint axis and precision therapy for OA.","2024","Journal of molecular biology"

A retrospective cohort study to determine the key factors affecting the surgical treatment on a subset of patients with localized RCC (T1-T2) that underwent surgical treatment at primary investigational center from 2010 to 2017. Primary results were validated on the retrospective dataset of patients treated at high-volume referent center. Validation aimed to test applicability of the predictive model designed during primary analysis. To determine the relationship between the risks of radical or partial nephrectomy, the multivariate predictive modeling method was used. Based on the analysis, for polary and laterally located tumors, the risk of RN was conditioned only by remaining functioning parenchyma volume (RFPV). The average critical value of RFPV for polar lesions was = 58%; for lateral tumors = 67%. For medial location, the risk of RN only depended on the tumor size. Average critical value of the tumor size in the medial location was = 38mm. Based on the ROC curve comparison, there were no statistically significant differences between the predictive models containing 12 and 3 factors (AUCLin_12 and AUCMLP_3; P = 0.12); thus, the reduced amount of the factor indicators from 12 to 3 did not worsen the model predictive qualities. Designed during primary analysis hypothesis was successfully validated in a referent center on the cohort of 300 patients. Predictive model is characterized by high sensitivity (95.2%) and specificity (95.4%) in selecting patients for partial nephrectomy. For the polar and lateral tumor locations, the functioning parenchymal volumes of over 58 and 67% respectively serve as PN indications. However, for the medial lesions, the primary PN indication is a tumor size less than 38 mm.","2024","Urologic oncology"

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed on previously collected HAI assessments from 212 infants (104 females, 108 males) aged from 3.5 to 8.5 months, to select items suitable for screening. The area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and cut-off values were derived for the suggested item combination. The clinical outcome (unilateral CP yes or no) at 24 months or older served as the external criterion. About half of the infants developed unilateral CP. The AUC across the items ranged from 0.63 to 0.80, and from 0.85 to 0.87 for different item combinations. Sensitivity for the selected 6-item set was 91% for 8 points or less and 88% for 7 points or less on the contralesional score of each hand, while specificity was 60% and 73% respectively. The s-HAI, designed from six HAI items, has the potential to be used to screen infants at risk of unilateral CP from 3.5 months of age.

Subgroups were divided according to different gender, age, BMI, and bone mass to compare the differences in parametric variables. One-way ANOVA, independent samples t-test, correlation coefficient analysis, linear regression analysis, and ROC curve analysis were performed. Significant differences were found in FF among different bone mass groups, and between different gender and age groups. While R2* only had a significant difference between different gender groups and males with different ages. BMD was significantly negatively correlated with FF, especially in women, and FF significantly negatively affected BMD after controlling for gender, age, and BMI. There was mildly positive correlation between BMD and R2* in men, and R2* significantly positively influenced BMD controlling for the confounders. In addition, FF was positively correlated with age, whereas R2* was negatively correlated with age in men. FF had high diagnostic efficacy for low bone mass and osteoporosis, while R2* alone was weakly diagnostic. Vertebral FF can be served as a potentially important imaging biomarker for assessing low BMD and osteoporosis, and R2* of males can be utilized as a complementary parameter for evaluating osteoporosis. The IDEAL-IQ sequence has the potential to be used as an accessory examination in the diagnosis of osteoporosis, assessment of treatment efficacy, and prediction of fracture risk.","2024","The British journal of radiology"

Understanding the mechanisms of miRNA is critical for developing effective diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. miRNA-mRNA interactions emerge as the most important mechanism to be understood despite their experimental validation constraints. Accordingly, several computational models have been developed to predict miRNA-mRNA interactions, albeit presenting limited predictive capabilities, poor characterisation of miRNA-mRNA interactions, and low usability. To address these drawbacks, we developed PRIMITI, a PRedictive model for the Identification of novel miRNA-Target mRNA Interactions. PRIMITI is a novel machine learning model that utilises CLIP-seq and expression data to characterise functional target sites in 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) and predict miRNA-target mRNA repression activity. The model was trained using a reliable negative sample selection approach and the robust extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) model, which was coupled with newly introduced features, including sequence and genetic variation information. PRIMITI achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) up to 0.96 for a prediction of functional miRNA-target site binding and 0.96 for a prediction of miRNA-target mRNA repression activity on cross-validation and an independent blind test. Additionally, the model outperformed state-of-the-art methods in recovering miRNA-target repressions in an unseen microarray dataset and in a collection of validated miRNA-mRNA interactions, highlighting its utility for preliminary screening.

The study included 68 SCH patients who received mechanical ventilation for more than 24 h, with 39 cases (57.3%) resulting in successful extubation. The multivariate analysis identified four factors significantly associated with extubation success: patient age under 66 years, an Intracerebral Hemorrhage (ICH) score less than 4 points, the presence of tissue shift, and a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score (excluding language) above 6 points at extubation. By simplifying the prediction model, we obtained the Spontaneous Cerebellar Hemorrhage Extubation Success scoring system (SCHES-SCORE). Within the scoring system, 2 points were allocated for a GCS score (excluding language) above 6 at extubation, 1 point each for age under 66 years and an ICH score below 4, while tissue shift was assigned a negative point. A score of Grade A (SCHES-SCORE = 3-4) was found to correlate with a 92.9% success rate for extubation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.923 (95% CI, 0.863 to 0.983). Notably, successful extubation was significantly linked to reduced durations of mechanical ventilation, intensive care unit (ICU) stay, and total hospital stay. In conclusion, the scoring system developed for assessing extubation outcomes in SCH patients has the potential to enhance the rate of successful extubation and overall patient outcomes.","2024","Cerebellum (London, England)"

We evaluated the quality of studies using the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool and certainty using GRADE. We conducted network meta-analysis and meta-analysis to estimate the odds ratio (OR) and pooled C-statistic, respectively, and 95% confidence intervals (CI) (PROSPERO: CRD42022349764). Of 5,653 records identified, we included 28 studies of 678,837 type 1 or 2 diabetes participants, of which 38,579 (5.7%) had DR. A total of 19, 3, and 7 studies were at high, unclear, and low risk of bias, respectively. Drugs included in models as predictors were: insulin (n = 24), antihypertensives (n = 5), oral antidiabetics (n = 12), lipid-lowering drugs (n = 7), antiplatelets (n = 2). Drug exposure was modelled primarily as a categorical variable (n = 23 studies). Two studies handled drug exposure as time-varying covariates, and one as a time-dependent covariate. Insulin was associated with an increased risk of DR (OR = 2.50; 95% CI: 1.61-3.86). Models that included insulin (n = 9) had a higher pooled C-statistic (C-statistic = 0.84, CI: 0.80-0.88), compared to models (n = 9) that incorporated a combination of drugs alongside insulin (C-statistic = 0.79, CI: 0.74-0.84), as well as models (n = 3) not including insulin (C-statistic = 0.70, CI: 0.64-0.75). Limitations include the high risk of bias and significant heterogeneity in reviewed studies. This is the first review assessing drug exposure handling in DR prediction models. Drug exposure was primarily modelled as a categorical variable, with insulin associated with improved model performance. However, due to suboptimal drug handling, associations between other drugs and model performance may have been overlooked. This review proposes the following for future DR prediction models: (1) evaluation of drug exposure as a variable, (2) use of time-varying methodologies, and (3) consideration of drug regimen details. Improving drug exposure handling could potentially unveil novel variables capable of significantly enhancing the predictive capability of prediction models.","2024","American journal of ophthalmology"

DE value exceeding 1.015 cm had an AUC value of 0.785, noting that DE value had a high specificity (90.2%) for predicting successful weaning, but a lower sensitivity (60%). After merging, the AUC of whole strain and DE was 0.856, and the sensitivity (80%) and specificity (80.4%) were more balanced compared to using DE alone. The findings of this study demonstrate the feasibility of using speckle tracking ultrasound to assess diaphragmatic function in mechanically ventilated patients. The combined utilization of whole strain and DE provides a more precise evaluation of diaphragmatic function in ICU patient, which may improve patient outcome.","2024","Frontiers in medicine"

Patients with confirmed pathological lymphoma subtypes who had undergone ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound examinations were enrolled. Clinical and ultrasound imaging features were retrospectively analysed and compared to the pathological results, which were considered the gold standard for diagnosis. Two diagnostic models were developed: a clinical model (Model-C) using clinical data only, and a combined model (Model-US) integrating ultrasound features into the clinical model. The efficacy of these models in differentiating between indolent and aggressive lymphoma was compared. In total, 236 consecutive patients were enrolled, including 78 patients with indolent lymphomas and 158 patients with aggressive lymphomas. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that the areas under the curves of Model-C and Model-US were 0.78 (95 % confidence interval: 0.72-0.84) and 0.87 (95 % confidence interval: 0.82-0.92), respectively (p < 0.001). Model-US was further evaluated for calibration and is presented as a nomogram. The diagnostic model incorporated clinical and ultrasound characteristics and offered a noninvasive method for assessing lymphoma with good discrimination and calibration.","2024","European journal of radiology"

An Application of Machine Learning to the ROCK Prospective Cohort.","There are limited evidence-based guidelines to predict which osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) lesions will heal with nonoperative treatment. To train a set of classification algorithms to predict nonoperative OCD healing while identifying new clinically meaningful predictors. Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. Patients with OCD of the knee with open physes undergoing nonoperative management were prospectively queried from the Research on OCD of the Knee (ROCK) cohort (https://kneeocd.org) in April 2022. Patients were included if they met the study criteria for nonoperative treatment success or failure. Nonoperative treatment success was defined as complete healing on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and total return to sports participation. Failure was defined as the crossover from nonoperative management to surgery at any point at or beyond the 3-month follow-up. If a patient did not meet one of these criteria, they were not included. Normalized lesion size, lesion location, patient characteristics, and symptoms were used as clinically relevant predictors. A total of 64 patients were included, of whom 24 (37.5%) patients successfully healed with nonoperative management. Multivariate logistic regression revealed that a 1% increase in normalized lesion width was associated with an increase in the likelihood of nonoperative failure (odds ratio [OR], 1.41 [95% CI, 1.17-1.81]; P < .01). By contrast, lesions in the posterior sagittal zone (OR, 0.08 [95% CI, 0.009-0.43]; P < .01) or the medial-most coronal zone (for lesions of the medial femoral) and lateral-most coronal zone (for lesions of the lateral femoral condyle) on MRI (OR, 0.05 [95% CI, 0.004-0.44]; P < .01) were associated with a decrease in the likelihood of nonoperative treatment failure. Support vector machines had a cross-validated area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 and a classification accuracy of 83.3%. Lesion location in the posterior aspect of the condyle on sagittal MRI and lesion location in the medial-most or lateral-most locations on coronal MRI were identified as statistically significant predictors of increased nonoperative treatment success on multivariate analysis.

Understanding the mechanisms driving these network abnormalities is critical for advancing diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. This study adopted a multimodal approach, combining functional connectivity (FC) analysis, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and gene expression profiling to investigate DMN disruptions in mTBI. A primary focus was placed on the middle cingulate cortex (MCC), a region consistently identified with increased connectivity. We explored the structural and molecular changes underlying this phenomenon. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was utilized to assess the diagnostic potential of DTI-derived metrics, while white matter tractography was employed to explore structural connectivity between the MCC and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Our findings revealed significant disruptions in DMN connectivity, with the MCC prominently involved in mTBI pathology. DTI analyses identified pronounced axonal injury in the MCC, characterized by decreased fractional anisotropy (FA) and axial diffusivity (AD), alongside increased isotropy (ISO), indicating compromised white matter integrity and diffuse axonal injury. Gene expression profiling revealed the upregulation of pathways related to synaptic transmission, ion channel regulation, and axonal injury response. ROC analysis demonstrated that ISO serves as a particularly effective biomarker for mTBI, showing high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.871). White matter tractography further confirmed strong structural connectivity between the MCC and the DLPFC, identifying potential therapeutic targets for neuromodulation. This study provides robust evidence that diffuse axonal injury plays a pivotal role in DMN abnormalities observed in mTBI. The integration of FC, DTI, and gene expression profiling offers a comprehensive framework for understanding mTBI's impact on brain networks. Our findings also highlight the DLPFC as a promising target for therapeutic interventions aimed at addressing cognitive and emotional deficits associated with mTBI.","2024","CNS neuroscience & therapeutics"

We aimed to predict the development of severe respiratory failure, defined as the need for high-flow oxygen support, continuous positive airway pressure, or mechanical ventilation, in patients with COVID-19, using machine learning algorithms to identify the most important variables in achieving this prediction. Methods: This retrospective, cross-sectional study included COVID-19 patients with mild respiratory failure (mostly receiving oxygen through a mask or nasal cannula). We used XGBoost, support vector machines, multi-layer perceptron, k-nearest neighbor, random forests, decision trees, logistic regression, and naïve Bayes methods to accurately predict severe respiratory failure in these patients. Results: A total of 320 patients (62.1% male; average age, 54.67 ± 15.82 years) were included in this study. During the follow-ups of these cases, 114 patients (35.6%) required high-level oxygen support, 67 (20.9%) required intensive care unit admission, and 43 (13.4%) died. The machine learning algorithms with the highest accuracy values were XGBoost, support vector machines, k-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and multi-layer perceptron (0.7395, 0.7395, 0.7291, 0.7187, and 0.75, respectively). The method that obtained the highest ROC-AUC value was logistic regression (ROC-AUC = 0.7274). The best predictors of severe respiratory failure were a low lymphocyte count, a high computed tomography score in the right and left upper lung zones, an elevated neutrophil count, a small decrease in CRP levels on the third day of admission, a high Charlson comorbidity index score, and a high serum procalcitonin level. Conclusions: The development of severe respiratory failure in patients with COVID-19 could be successfully predicted using machine learning methods, especially logistic regression, and the best predictors of severe respiratory failure were the lymphocyte count and the degree of upper lung zone involvement.","2024","Journal of clinical medicine"

In this systematic review, we evaluated the efficacy of prediction of LNM by artificial intelligence (AI) models utilizing whole slide image (WSI) in patients with T1 CRC. In accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines, a systematic review was conducted through searches in PubMed (MEDLINE), Embase, and the Cochrane Library for relevant studies published up to December 2023. The inclusion criteria were studies assessing the accuracy of hematoxylin and eosin-stained WSI-based AI models for predicting LNM in patients with T1 CRC. Four studies met the criteria for inclusion in this systematic review. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for these AI models ranged from 0.57 to 0.76. In the three studies in which AI performance was compared directly with current treatment guidelines, AI consistently exhibited a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. At a fixed sensitivity of 100%, specificities ranged from 18.4% to 45.0%.

Here, we investigate whether plasma levels of the novel biomarker brain-derived tau (BD-tau) reflect cerebral infarct volumes and whether BD-tau can improve clinical outcome prediction. The present study included 713 consecutive cases from two different hospital-based cohorts, the Sahlgrenska Academy Study on Ischemic Stroke (SAHLSIS) and SAHLSIS phase 2 (SAHLSIS2). Acute stroke severity was determined by the Scandinavian Stroke Scale converted to the National Institutes of Health stroke scale (NIHSS) in SAHLSIS and by the NIHSS in SAHLSIS2. All participants were assessed for functional outcome 3 months after stroke by the modified Rankin Scale, and 254 participants in SAHLSIS had quantitative neuroimaging available. Plasma BD-tau concentrations and cerebral infarct volumes were highly correlated (ρ 0.72, p < 0.001). BD-tau improved the prognostic accuracy of suffering an unfavorable outcome over age and stroke severity in the whole cohort. However, the gain in predictive power was dependent on stroke severity and infarct location. The largest improvement was observed for mild ischemic strokes (NIHSS <5; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.73 for age + NIHSS versus AUC = 0.84 with addition of BD-tau; DeLong p 0.02), posterior circulation stroke (AUC = 0.75 vs. AUC = 0.84; DeLong p 0.06) and more specifically for infarcts in the brainstem/cerebellum (AUC = 0.74 vs. 0.87; DeLong p 0.009).

Consequently, there's a pressing need for circulating biomarkers in clinical settings. MicroRNAs (miRNAs), being stable in peripheral circulation, hold promise as potential biomarkers for PAS. This study recruited singleton live pregnancies, including cases of invasive PAS, placenta previa (PP), and controls, across three phases. Initially, RNA-seq of peripheral blood identified 6 miRNAs in the screening phase. Subsequently, in the training and validation phases, miR-23a-5p, along with its target genes ASF1B and CHTF8, were validated using qRT-PCR. The diagnostic value of these markers for PAS and adverse outcomes was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves. The results showed miR-23a-5p was down-regulated in PAS, whereas ASF1B and CHTF8 were up-regulated. miR-23a-5p had modest diagnostic efficiency for PAS and adverse outcomes, as the AUC were 0.689 and 0.711 respectively. However, when miR-23a-5p combined with CHTF8, the AUC can improve greatly to 0.869 in PAS diagnosis and 0.856 in prediction of adverse outcomes. We propose the miR-23a-5p plays a role in PAS pathogenesis through regulating cell proliferation, migration, invasion, apoptosis by targeting various genes. This study confirmed its potential value of miR-23a-5p combined with target gene CHTF8 as novel biomarkers for PAS and adverse outcomes.","2024","Placenta"

The objective of this study was to develop a test-free, self-assessable approach to identify sarcopenia by utilizing artificial intelligence techniques and representative real-world data. This multicentre study enrolled 11 661 middle-aged and older adults from a national survey initialized in 2011. Follow-up data from the baseline cohort collected in 2013 (n = 9403) and 2015 (n = 10 356) were used for validation. Sarcopenia was retrospectively diagnosed using the Asian Working Group for Sarcopenia 2019 framework. Baseline age, sex, height, weight and 20 functional capacity (FC)-related binary indices (activities of daily living = 6, instrumental activities of daily living = 5 and other FC indices = 9) were considered as predictors. Multiple machine learning (ML) models were trained and cross-validated using 70% of the baseline data to predict sarcopenia. The remaining 30% of the baseline data, along with two follow-up datasets (n = 9403 and n = 10 356, respectively), were used to assess model performance. The study included 5634 men and 6027 women (median age = 57.0 years). Sarcopenia was identified in 1288 (11.0%) individuals. Among the 20 FC indices, the running/jogging 1 km item showed the highest predictive value for sarcopenia (AUC [95%CI] = 0.633 [0.620-0.647]). From the various ML models assessed, a 24-variable gradient boosting classifier (GBC) model was selected. This GBC model demonstrated favourable performance in predicting sarcopenia in the holdout data (AUC [95%CI] = 0.831 [0.808-0.853], accuracy = 0.889, recall = 0.441, precision = 0.475, F1 score = 0.458, Kappa = 0.396 and Matthews correlation coefficient = 0.396). Further model validation on the temporal scale using two longitudinal datasets also demonstrated good performance (AUC [95%CI]: 0.833 [0.818-0.848] and 0.852 [0.840-0.865], respectively). The model's built-in feature importance ranking and the SHapley Additive exPlanations method revealed that lifting 5 kg and running/jogging 1 km were relatively important variables among the 20 FC items contributing to the model's predictive capacity, respectively. The calibration curve of the model indicated good agreement between predictions and actual observations (Hosmer and Lemeshow p = 0.501, 0.451 and 0.374 for the three test sets, respectively), and decision curve analysis supported its clinical usefulness. The model was implemented as an online web application and exported as a deployable binary file, allowing for flexible, individualized risk assessment. We developed an artificial intelligence model that can assist in the identification of sarcopenia, particularly in settings lacking the necessary resources for a comprehensive diagnosis. These findings offer potential for improving decision-making and facilitating the development of novel management strategies of sarcopenia.","2024","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle"

Metabolomics-based scores were previously developed to predict 5- and 10-year mortality (MetaboHealth) and biological age (MetaboAge). This study aims to investigate the association of MetaboHealth and MetaboAge with 1-year mortality in older patients with solid tumors, and to study their predictive value for mortality in addition to established clinical predictors. This prospective cohort study included patients aged ≥ 70 years with a solid malignant tumor, who underwent blood sampling and a geriatric assessment before treatment initiation. The outcome was all-cause 1-year mortality. Of the 192 patients, the median age was 77 years. With each SD increase of MetaboHealth, patients had a 2.32 times increased risk of mortality (HR 2.32, 95% CI 1.59-3.39). With each year increase in MetaboAge, there was a 4% increased risk of mortality (HR 1.04, 1.01-1.07). MetaboHealth and MetaboAge showed an AUC of 0.66 (0.56-0.75) and 0.60 (0.51-0.68) for mortality prediction accuracy, respectively. The AUC of a predictive model containing age, primary tumor site, distant metastasis, comorbidity, and malnutrition was 0.76 (0.68-0.83). Addition of MetaboHealth increased AUC to 0.80 (0.74-0.87) (p = 0.09) and AUC did not change with MetaboAge (0.76 (0.69-0.83) (p = 0.89)). Higher MetaboHealth and MetaboAge scores were associated with 1-year mortality. The addition of MetaboHealth to established clinical predictors only marginally improved mortality prediction in this cohort with various types of tumors. MetaboHealth may potentially improve identification of older patients vulnerable for adverse events, but numbers were too small for definitive conclusions.

Methods: A total of one hundred patients with AF (mean age: 68 ± 9 years, 50% with paroxysmal AF) were included in this study. Each patient underwent a high-resolution 3D LGE MRI prior to catheter ablation, allowing for detailed imaging of the LA wall. Quantitative analysis of the enhancement was performed using dedicated software designed for volumetric measurements of LA LGE. Recurrence of AF was monitored over a 90-day period following the ablation procedure. The primary outcome was the correlation between the volume of LGE in the LA and the recurrence of AF. Results: Multivariate analysis confirmed that the volume of LA LGE, defined as the volume exceeding 1SD above the mean signal intensity of the LA, was an independent predictor of recurrence [hazard ratio: 1.16 (95%CI: 1.04-1.29, p = 0.0057)]. The area under the curve for recurrence prediction using 3D LGE MRI was 0.74 (95%CI: 0.63-0.86), with an optimal threshold of 11.72 mL, providing a sensitivity of 55% (95%CI: 32-77%) and a specificity of 86% (95%CI: 77-93%).

Multivariable logistic regression evaluated the association between PSMA PET quantified parameters and surgical ISUP GG. Decision-tree analysis was performed to identify discriminative thresholds for all three parameters related to the five ISUP GGs The ROC-derived AUC was used to determine whether the inclusion of PSMA quantified parameters improved the ability of multivariable models to predict ISUP GG ≥ 4. A total of 605 patients were included. Overall, 2%, 37%, 37%, 10% and 13% patients had pathologic ISUP GG1, 2, 3, 4, and 5, respectively. At multivariable analyses, all three parameters SUVmax, PSMAvolume and PSMAtotal were associated with GG ≥ 4 at surgical pathology after accounting for PSA and clinical T stage based on DRE, hospital and radioligand (all p < 0.05). Addition of all three parameters significantly improved the discrimination of clinical models in predicting GG ≥ 4 from 68% (95%CI 63 - 74) to 74% (95%CI 69 - 79) for SUVmax, 72% (95%CI 67 - 76) for PSMAvolume, 74% (70 - 79) for PSMAtotal and 75% (95%CI 71 - 80) when all parameters were included (all p < 0.05).

We used a cohort of women from the UK Biobank Study aged 45 to 69 years, free of CVD at baseline (2006-2010) followed until the end of 2019. We developed Cox proportional hazards models using the risk factors included in 3 contemporary CVD risk calculators: Pooled Cohort Equation - Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, Qrisk2, and PREDICT. We added each of the following female-specific risk factors, individually and all together, to determine if these improved measures of discrimination and calibration for predicting CVD: early menarche (<11 years), endometriosis, excessive, frequent or irregular menstruation, miscarriage, number of miscarriages, number of stillbirths, infertility, preeclampsia or eclampsia, gestational diabetes (without subsequent type 2 diabetes), premature menopause (<40 years), early menopause (<45 years), and natural or surgical early menopause (menopause <45 years or timing of menopause reported as unknown and oophorectomy reported at age <45). In the model of 135 142 women (mean age, 57.5 years; SD, 6.8) using risk factors from Pooled Cohort Equation - Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, CVD incidence was 5.3 per 1000 person-years. The c-indices for the Pooled Cohort Equation - Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, Qrisk2, and PREDICT models were 0.710, 0.713, and 0.718, respectively. Adding each of the female-specific risk factors did not improve the c-index, the net reclassification index, the integrated discrimination index, the slope of the regression line for predicted versus observed events, and the Brier score or plots of calibration. Adding all female-specific risk factors simultaneously increased the c-index for the Pooled Cohort Equation - Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease, Qrisk2, and PREDICT models to 0.712, 0.715, and 0.720, respectively. Although several female-specific factors have been shown to be early indicators of CVD risk, these factors should not be used to reclassify risk in women aged 45 to 69 years when considering whether to commence a blood pressure or lipid-lowering medication.","2024","Circulation.

The mean age of the sample was 46.86 years (±16.97), with a gender distribution of 6,721 males and 5,991 females. The variables included demographic, physical-related variables, and lifestyle variables. This study developed 42 prediction models using six machine learning methods, including logistic regression, Support Vector Machine (SVM), decision tree, random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), and Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM). The relative importance of each variable was evaluated by permutation feature importance. Results: The results illustrated that the LightGBM was the most effective algorithm for predicting recreational activity participation (accuracy: .838, precision: .783, recall: .967, F1-score: .865, AUC: .826). In particular, prediction performance increased when the demographic and lifestyle datasets were used together. Next, as the result of the permutation feature importance based on the top models, education level and moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were found to be essential variables. Conclusion: These findings demonstrated the potential of a data-driven approach utilizing machine learning in a recreational discipline.

Although many detection methods have noticed the importance of local artifacts, there has been a lack of in-depth discussion regarding the selection of locations and their effective utilization. Besides, the traditional image augmentation methods that are widely used have limited improvements for forgery detection tasks and require more specialized augmentation methods specifically designed for forgery detection tasks. In this paper, this study proposes Local Artifacts Amplification for Deepfakes Augmentation, which amplifies the local artifacts on the forged faces. Furthermore, this study incorporates prior knowledge about similar facial features into the model. This means that within the facial regions defined in this work, forged features exhibit similar patterns. By aggregating the results from all facial regions, the study can enhance the overall performance of the model.

A retrospective review included 668 patients with pT3a RCC between 2008 and 2019, randomly divided into training and validation groups (7:3 ratio). Cox regression analysis established the RFS-predicting nomogram in the training group. Nomogram performance was assessed using Harrell's concordance index (C-index), time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve, decision curve analysis, and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. Of the 668 patients with pT3a RCC, 167 patients experienced local recurrence or distant metastasis. Using multivariable Cox regression analysis, tumor size, ISUP grade, necrosis, capsular invasion, pT3a invasion pattern were identified as the significant predictors for RFS to establish the nomogram. The C-index of the nomogram was 0.753 (95% CI, 0.710-0.796) and 0.762 (95% CI, 0.701-0.822) for the training and validating group, respectively. The areas under the 1-year, 3-year and 5-year RFS receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.814, 0.769 and 0.768, respectively. Decision curve analysis showed the optimal application of the model in clinical decision-making. Patients with low risk T3a RCC have better RFS than those with high risk T3a RCC. Tumor size, ISUP grade, necrosis, capsular invasion and T3a invasion patterns were independent risk factors for worse RFS in patients with nonmetastatic pT3a RCC. The current nomogram could effectively predict the RFS of patients with nonmetastatic pT3a RCC.","2024","Clinical genitourinary cancer"

For a number of cancer patients, operative resection with curative intent can end up in early recurrence of the cancer. Surgeons misidentifying visible peritoneal surface metastases is likely a common reason. CASL was developed and tested using staging laparoscopy images recorded from 132 patients with histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma involving the gastrointestinal tract. The data included images depicting 4287 visible peritoneal surface lesions and 3650 image patches of 365 biopsied peritoneal surface lesions. The prototype's diagnostic performance was compared with results from a national survey evaluating 111 oncologic surgeons in a simulated clinical environment. In a simulated environment, surgeons' accuracy in correctly recommending a biopsy for metastases while omitting a biopsy for benign lesions was only 52%. In this environment, the prototype of a deep learning surgical guidance system demonstrated improved performance in identifying peritoneal surface metastases compared to oncologic surgeons with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.69 (oncologic surgeon) versus 0.78 (CASL) versus 0.79 (human-computer combined). A proposed model would have improved the identification of metastases by 5% while reducing the number of unnecessary biopsies by 28% compared with current standard practice. Our findings demonstrate a pathway for an artificial intelligence system for intraoperative identification of peritoneal surface metastases but still require additional development and future validation in a multi-institutional clinical setting.","2024","Annals of surgery"

We determined the incidence rate and predictors of ICH in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (AF). A prospective nationwide registry of patients with AF was conducted from 27 hospitals in Thailand. The adjudicated primary outcome was the development of ICH during follow-up. Multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was performed to identify the independent predictors for ICH. A predictive model for ICH risk was developed and validated by bootstrap, calibration plot, C-statistics, and decision curve analysis using our own data. We studied a total of 3405 patients (mean age 67.8 years; 58.2% male) with an average follow-up duration of 31.8 ± 8.7 months, during which ICH developed in 70 patients (2.06%). The incidence rate of ICH was 0.78 (0.61-0.98) per 100 person-years. Predictors of ICH were chosen from the theory-driven approaches in combination with the results of the univariable analysis. The predictive risk model had a c-index of 0.717 (0.702-0.732) with good calibration, internal validation, and clinical usefulness using decision curve analysis. The probability of ICH at 3 years for an individual patient derived from the prediction model was compared with the probability derived from HAS-BLED score by using the C-statistics. The ICH probability from the COOL-AF model was superior to the HAS-BLED score in the prediction of ICH. The incidence rate of ICH was 0.78 (0.61-0.98) per 100 person-years.

We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and other databases for studies related to DUPAN-2 and its prognostic and diagnostic relevance in PC, covering publications up to August 2024. We used pooled hazard ratios (HRs) to evaluate the prognostic value of DUPAN-2 in PC, the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) to assess diagnostic performance, while pooled odds ratios (ORs) analyzed associations with clinicopathological features. A total of 22 studies involving 4765 patients were included in this meta-analysis, with 11 studies focusing on diagnostic analysis, 10 on prognostic analysis, and 3 on clinicopathological features. The diagnostic meta-analysis revealed a pooled sensitivity of 0.63 (95 % CI: 0.56-0.69), a pooled specificity of 0.98 (95 % CI: 0.95-0.99), and an AUC of 0.83 (95 % CI: 0.79-0.86). Subgroup analysis indicated that a DUPAN-2 threshold at 150 U/mL achieved the highest diagnostic performance. The prognostic meta-analysis demonstrated that elevated DUPAN-2 levels were associated with poorer OS (HR = 1.70, 95 % CI: 1.36-2.14) and PFS (HR = 1.33, 95 % CI: 1.14-1.56).

Serine/threonine kinase (STK11) mutation was shown to be related to low PD-L1 expression and objective response rate (ORR) in nonsmall cell lung cancer (NSCLC), resulting in poor progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Herein, we hypothesized that combining cadonilimab with chemotherapy could enhance antitumor immunity and extend survival in these patients. Consequently, we designed this study to explore the clinical activity and safety of cadonilimab combined with chemotherapy in patients with advanced/metastatic NSCLC harboring STK11 alteration. This single-center, open-label, single-arm phase II trial is conducted at the first affiliated hospital of Guangzhou Medical University. Treatment-naïve advanced/metastatic NSCLC patients harboring STK11 mutation will be enrolled in this study.

790,"39488093","Active learning based on multi-enhanced views for classification of multiple patterns in lung ultrasound images.","There are several main patterns in lung ultrasound (LUS) images, including A-lines, B-lines, consolidation and pleural effusion. LUS images of healthy lungs typically only exhibit A-lines, while other patterns may emerge or coexist in LUS images associated with different lung diseases. The accurate categorization of these primary patterns is pivotal for effective lung disease screening. However, two challenges complicate the classification task: the first is the inherent blurring of feature differences between main patterns due to ultrasound imaging properties; and the second is the potential coexistence of multiple patterns in a single case, with only the most dominant pattern being clinically annotated. To address these challenges, we propose the active learning based on multi-enhanced views (MEVAL) method to achieve more precise pattern classification in LUS. To accentuate feature differences between multiple patterns, we introduce a feature enhancement module by applying vertical linear fitting and k-means clustering. The multi-enhanced views are then employed in parallel with the original images, thus enhancing MEVAL's awareness of feature differences between multiple patterns. To tackle the patterns coexistence issue, we propose an active learning strategy based on confidence sets and misclassified sets. This strategy enables the network to simultaneously recognize multiple patterns by selectively labeling of a small number of images. Our dataset comprises 5075 LUS images, with approximately 4% exhibiting multiple patterns. Experimental results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed method in the classification task, with accuracy of 98.72%, AUC of 0.9989, sensitivity of 98.76%, and specificity of 98.16%, which outperforms than the state-of-the-art deep learning-based methods.

Consequently, this study investigates the feasibility of using arabinogalactan-rich nanomucilage derived from garden cress seeds as an egg replacement in cupcake production. The microwave-assisted process resulted in 23.28 ± 0.34 % yield and it demonstrated a nanoscale particle size of 146.3 ± 2.67 nm. Smooth surfaces with spherical concavities-shaped particles were observed containing carbohydrate and protein-based functional groups. A market survey involving 250 participants indicated a notable interest in egg-free cupcakes, with 75% of respondents determining a willingness to sample them. Cupcakes containing 15% nanomucilage (C3) exhibited comparable sensory acceptability and similar physicochemical properties, along with significantly improved hardness (751.03 ± 1.24 g), resilience (23.98 ± 0.56), and chewiness (513.75 ± 1.37 g) when compared to egg-based cupcakes. In vitro digestibility exhibited a significant reduction in the area under the curve for reducing sugars in C3 (155.68 mg g-1) relative to the control (238.83 mg g-1), suggesting a lower glycemic index.

793,"38861429","Improved Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning for Recommendation.","Collaborative Metric Learning (CML) has recently emerged as a popular method in recommendation systems (RS), closing the gap between metric learning and collaborative filtering. Following the convention of RS, existing practices exploit unique user representation in their model design. This paper focuses on a challenging scenario where a user has multiple categories of interests. Under this setting, the unique user representation might induce preference bias, especially when the item category distribution is imbalanced. To address this issue, we propose a novel method called Diversity-Promoting Collaborative Metric Learning (DPCML), with the hope of considering the commonly ignored minority interest of the user. The key idea behind DPCML is to introduce a set of multiple representations for each user in the system where users' preference toward an item is aggregated by taking the minimum item-user distance among their embedding set. Specifically, we instantiate two effective assignment strategies to explore a proper quantity of vectors for each user. Meanwhile, a Diversity Control Regularization Scheme (DCRS) is developed to accommodate the multi-vector representation strategy better. Theoretically, we show that DPCML could induce a smaller generalization error than traditional CML. Furthermore, we notice that CML-based approaches usually require negative sampling to reduce the heavy computational burden caused by the pairwise objective therein. In this paper, we reveal the fundamental limitation of the widely adopted hard-aware sampling from the One-Way Partial AUC (OPAUC) perspective and then develop an effective sampling alternative for the CML-based paradigm. Finally, comprehensive experiments over a range of benchmark datasets speak to the efficacy of DPCML.","2024","IEEE transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence"

A custom-built microscopic confocal Raman system (MCRS) was used to collect Raman spectra, which were processed by smoothing, denoising, and baseline calibrating to refine raw data. Independent sample t-tests were used to analyze spectral feature peaks among sample types. Significant differences (P < 0.001) were found in multiple Raman spectral characteristic peaks (854 cm-1, 937 cm-1, 1002 cm-1, 1243 cm-1, 1448 cm-1, and 2940 cm-1) between low and high myopia samples, particularly at 2940 cm-1. Differences were also found between low and moderate, and moderate and high myopia samples, although fewer than between low and high myopia samples. The three-classification model, particularly with PLS-KNN training, exhibited superior discriminative performance with accuracy rates of 95%. Similarly, the two-classification model for low and high myopia achieved high accuracy with PLS-KNN (94.4%) compared to PCA-KNN (93.3%). PLS dimensionality reduction slightly outperformed PCA, enhancing classification accuracy. In addition, in both reduction methods, the KNN algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy and performance. The optimal PLS-KNN classification model showed AUC values of 0.99, 0.98, and 1.00 for ROC curves corresponding to low, moderate, and high myopia, respectively.

We aimed to determine the accuracy and predictive validity of the Fluctuating Mental Status Evaluation (FMSE), a novel delirium screening tool developed specifically for neurocritically ill patients. Prospective validation study. Neurocritical care unit at an academic medical center. One hundred thirty-nine neurocritically ill stroke patients (mean age, 63.9 [ sd , 15.9], median National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score 11 [interquartile range, 2-17]). None. Expert raters performed daily Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition-based delirium assessments, while paired FMSE assessments were performed by trained clinicians. We analyzed 717 total noncomatose days of paired assessments, of which 52% ( n = 373) were rated by experts as days with delirium; 53% of subjects were delirious during one or more days. Compared with expert ratings, the overall accuracy of the FMSE was high (area under the curve [AUC], 0.85; 95% CI, 0.82-0.87). FMSE scores greater than or equal to 1 had 86% sensitivity and 74% specificity on a per-assessment basis, while scores greater than or equal to 2 had 70% sensitivity and 88% specificity. Accuracy remained high in patients with aphasia (FMSE ≥ 1: 82% sensitivity, 64% specificity; FMSE ≥ 2: 64% sensitivity, 84% specificity) and those with decreased arousal (FMSE ≥ 1: 87% sensitivity, 77% specificity; FMSE ≥ 2: 71% sensitivity, 90% specificity).

Cohort study; Level of evidence, 3. Arthroscopic rotator cuff repairs for tears with both anteroposterior and mediolateral diameters >1 cm on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging were included and divided into a training set (70%) and an internal validation set (30%). For external validation, rotator cuff repairs performed by 2 different surgeons were included in a test set. Machine learning models and a newly adjusted scoring system were developed using the training set. The performance of the models including the adjusted scoring system and 2 previous scoring systems were compared using the test set. The performance was assessed using metrics such as the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared using the net reclassification improvement based on the adjusted scoring system. A total of 429 patients were included for the training and internal validation set, and 112 patients were included for the test set. An elastic-net logistic regression demonstrated the best performance, with an AUROC of 0.847 and net reclassification improvement of 0.071, compared with the adjusted scoring system in the test set. The AUROC of the adjusted scoring system was 0.786, and the AUROCs of the previous scoring systems were 0.757 and 0.687. The elastic-net logistic regression was transformed into an accessible online model. The performance of the machine learning model, which provides a probability estimation for rotator cuff reparability, is comparable with that of the adjusted scoring system.

We retrospectively included patients with brainstem gliomas aged ≤ 18 years admitted between July 2011 and March 2023. Applying Response Assessment in Pediatric Neuro-Oncology criteria, we categorized patients into PR and non-PR groups. For qualitative analysis, tumor heterogeneity vision was classified into four grades based on T2-weighted images. Quantitative analysis included the relative T2 signal intensity ratio (rT2SR), extra pons volume ratio, and tumor ring-enhancement volume. Radiomic features were extracted from T2-weighted and T1-enhanced images of volumes of interest. Univariate analysis was used to identify independent variables related to PR. Multivariate logistic regression was performed using significant variables (p < 0.05) from univariate analysis. Of 140 patients (training n = 109, and test n = 31), 64 (45.7%) achieved PR. The AUC of the predictive model with extrapontine volume ratio, rT2SRmax-min (rT2SRdif), and grade was 0.89. The AUCs of the T2-weighted and T1WI-enhanced models with radiomic signatures were 0.84 and 0.81, respectively. For the 31 DIPG test sets, the AUCs were 0.91, 0.83, and 0.81, for the models incorporating the quantitative features, radiomic model (T2-weighted images, and T1W1-enhanced images), respectively. Combining T2-weighted quantification with qualitative and extrapontine volume ratios reliably predicted pediatric DIPG radiotherapy response. Combining T2-weighted quantification with qualitative and extrapontine volume ratios can accurately predict diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) radiotherapy response, which may facilitate personalized treatment and prognostic assessment for patients with DIPG.

Furthermore, the authors compared the predictive power of TRISS with the routinely used Injury Severity Score (ISS). The authors performed a retrospective review of their institutional database from June 2016 to June 2023 to identify cases of TBI based on a modified Centers for Disease Control and Prevention framework. Prolonged length of stay (LOS) was defined as a hospital stay falling into the upper quartile of the overall cohort. Discharge to an inpatient rehabilitation facility, acute care hospital, or foster care or death was defined as a nonroutine discharge disposition. Emergency department (ED) transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU) or operating room (OR) was defined as a proxy for severity of injuries. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to explore the association between ISS, TRISS, and high-value care outcomes. The DeLong test was used to assess the differences between the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROCs). This study included 2705 patients with a mean age ± SD of 7.28 ± 5.46 years (63% male). In the overall cohort, 28% experienced prolonged LOS, 7% had a nonroutine discharge disposition from the hospital, and 23% were transferred to the ICU/OR from the ED. In multivariate regression models, both TRISS and ISS were correlated with higher odds of prolonged LOS, nonroutine discharge disposition, and transfer to the ICU/OR from the ED (all p < 0.001). TRISS had a significantly greater AUROC than ISS for nonroutine discharge disposition (0.883 vs 0.849, p < 0.001) and transfer to the ICU/OR (0.898 vs 0.887, p = 0.045), but this result was not significant for prolonged LOS (0.873 vs 0.880, p = 0.140). TRISS and ISS are effective tools for predicting high-value care outcomes in pediatric TBI.

Noninvasive echocardiographic metrics were TAPSE/echo-derived pulmonary artery systolic pressure (PASP) and RVFW-LS/PASP. RVFW-LS correlated with PVRi (r=0.315, P=0.01), though TAPSE did not (r=0.058, P=0.64). PVRi, PASP, and RVAC metrics declined in patients with worse World Health Organization Functional Class (n=108), while TAPSE and RVFW-LS did not. PVRi, PASP, RVFW-LS/PVRi, TAPSE/PVRi, and RVFW-LS/PASP predicted the outcome variable of transplant or death (area under the curve, 0.771 [P<0.001], 0.729 [P=0.004], 0.748 [P=0.002], 0.732 [P=0.009], and 0.714 [P=0.01], respectively), while TAPSE/PASP, RVFW-LS, and TAPSE did not (area under the curve, 0.671, 0.603, and 0.525, respectively). In patients without a history of repaired congenital heart disease (n=88), only RVFW-LS/PASP, PVRi, PASP, and RVFW-LS/PVRi predicted outcomes (area under the curve, 0.738 [P=0.002], 0.729 [P=0.01], 0.729 [P=0.01], and 0.729 [P=0.015], respectively). In the pediatric population, baseline PVRi and echo-estimated PASP were strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes, but TAPSE and RVFW-LS were not. Estimates of RVAC utilizing RVFW-LS were superior to those utilizing TAPSE-however, only marginally additive to PASP and PVRi at predicting the adverse clinical outcome in patients without a history of repaired congenital heart disease.","2024","Circulation.

801,"38550971","Machine learning framework to extract the biomarker potential of plasma IgG N-glycans towards disease risk stratification.","Effective management of chronic diseases and cancer can greatly benefit from disease-specific biomarkers that enable informative screening and timely diagnosis. IgG N-glycans found in human plasma have the potential to be minimally invasive disease-specific biomarkers for all stages of disease development due to their plasticity in response to various genetic and environmental stimuli. Data analysis and machine learning (ML) approaches can assist in harnessing the potential of IgG glycomics towards biomarker discovery and the development of reliable predictive tools for disease screening. This study proposes an ML-based N-glycomic analysis framework that can be employed to build, optimise, and evaluate multiple ML pipelines to stratify patients based on disease risk in an interpretable manner. To design and test this framework, a published colorectal cancer (CRC) dataset from the Study of Colorectal Cancer in Scotland (SOCCS) cohort (1999-2006) was used. In particular, among the different pipelines tested, an XGBoost-based ML pipeline, which was tuned using multi-objective optimisation, calibrated using an inductive Venn-Abers predictor (IVAP), and evaluated via a nested cross-validation (NCV) scheme, achieved a mean area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.771 when classifying between age-, and sex-matched healthy controls and CRC patients. This performance suggests the potential of using the relative abundance of IgG N-glycans to define populations at elevated CRC risk who merit investigation or surveillance. Finally, the IgG N-glycans that highly impact CRC classification decisions were identified using a global model-agnostic interpretability technique, namely Accumulated Local Effects (ALE). We envision that open-source computational frameworks, such as the one presented herein, will be useful in supporting the translation of glycan-based biomarkers into clinical applications.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

This prospective observational study (March - November 2022) included children aged 1-12 years with sepsis admitted to the PICU. RRI and urine neutrophil gelatinase associated lipocalin (NGAL) were measured within 12 h of admission. Children were followed up for 3 days. AKI (new and persistent) was defined as any child with KDIGO stage 2 or 3 AKI on day 3. We enrolled 90 children but included 79 in final analysis. Two thirds (n = 53, 67%) had septic shock. Median (IQR) age was 6.2 years (4.1-9.2). RRI decreased with increasing age. Twenty-six (33%) children had AKI on day 3. Mean (SD) RRI was higher in the AKI group [0.72 (0.08) vs. 0.65 (0.07), p < 0.001].The area under ROC curve for RRI to detect AKI among the 1-4 year old group was 0.75 (95% CI:0.51, 0.98; p = 0.05) and among the 5-12 year old group was 0.76 (0.62, 0.89; p = 0.001).

CineECG is a novel ECG modality proposed for the spatial visualization and quantification of myocardial depolarization and repolarization sequences. The present study aimed to evaluate CineECG-derived parameters in different pacing modes and to test their associations with acute hemodynamic responses in CRT patients. CineECG was used to construct the average electrical path within the cardiac anatomy from the 12-lead ECG. CineECG and LV dP/dt max were tested in 15 patients with nonischemic dilated cardiomyopathy and left bundle branch block (QRS: 170 ± 17 ms; LVEF: 26 ± 5.5%) under pacing protocols with different LV lead localizations. The CineECG-derived path directions were computed for the QRS and ST-T intervals for the anteroposterior (Xh), interventricular (Yh), and apicobasal (Zh) axes. In a multivariate linear regression analysis with adjustment for the pacing protocol type, the ST-T path direction Yh was independently associated with the increase in dP/dt max during CRT, [regression coefficient 639.4 (95% confidence interval: 187.9-1090.9), p = 0.006].

The success of this task often depends on a large amount of data annotated by medical experts, which is time-consuming and may not always be feasible in the biomedical field. The lack of interpretability has greatly hindered the application of deep learning in the medical field. Currently, deep stable learning, including causal inference, make deep learning models more predictive and interpretable. In this study, to distinguish malignant tumors in Breast Imaging-Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) category 3-4A breast lesions, we propose BD-StableNet, a deep stable learning model for the automatic detection of lesion areas. In this retrospective study, we collected 3103 breast ultrasound images (1418 benign and 1685 malignant lesions) from 493 patients (361 benign and 132 malignant lesion patients) for model training and testing. Compared with other mainstream deep learning models, BD-StableNet has better prediction performance (accuracy = 0.952, area under the curve = 0.982, precision = 0.970, recall = 0.941,F1-score = 0.955 and specificity = 0.965). The lesion area prediction and class activation map results both verify that our proposed model is highly interpretable. The results indicate that BD-StableNet significantly enhances diagnostic accuracy and interpretability, offering a promising noninvasive approach for the diagnosis of BI-RADS category 3-4A breast lesions. Clinically, the use of BD-StableNet could reduce unnecessary biopsies, improve diagnostic efficiency, and ultimately enhance patient outcomes by providing more precise and reliable assessments of breast lesions.","2024","Physics in medicine and biology"

In our clinical acellular EVLP protocol, real-time LW was measured in 117 EVLP cases from June 2019 to June 2022. The estimated LW gain at each time point was calculated using a scale placed under the organ chamber. The lungs were classified into 4 categories based on LW adjusted for height and compared between suitable and unsuitable cases. The relationship between estimated LW gain and primary graft dysfunction was also investigated. The estimated LW gain during the EVLP significantly correlated with the LW gain (post-EVLP LW and pre-EVLP LW) measured on the back table (R2 = 0.61, p < 0.01). In the adjusted LW categories 2 to 4, the estimated LW gain at 0-1 hour after EVLP was significantly higher in unsuitable cases than in suitable cases. The area under the curve for the estimated LW gain was ≥0.80. Primary graft dysfunction grades 0 to 1 had a significantly lower estimated LW gain at 60 minutes than grades 2 to 3 (-43 vs 1 g, p < 0.01).

Peer-reviewed published studies were included if they met the following criteria: adults (≥ 18 years) living with HIV; reporting at least one PK parameter or plasma concentration of any ARV approved by the US FDA before 2005 and still used in the clinic: lamivudine (3TC), emtricitabine (FTC), tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF), abacavir (ABC), zidovudine (ZDV), efavirenz (EFV), nevirapine (NVP), atazanavir (ATV), lopinavir (LPV), ritonavir (RTV), tipranavir (TPV), and fosamprenavir (FPV); PK parameters stratified per age group as young (aged 18-49 years) or older (age ≥ 50 years) adults; and manuscripts published in English, Portuguese, or Spanish. All studies were evaluated for risk of bias. The review protocol was registered in the PROSPERO database (registration no. CRD42023463092). Among 106 studies included, only 22 evaluated the PK of participants aged 50 years or older and only 5 studies compared the PK between young and older adults for ATV, RTV, EFV, and 3TC. Our analysis revealed an increase in minimal concentration (Cmin) values for LPV, RTV, and ATV in older adults. While increased values of the area under the curve (AUC) and maximum concentration (Cmax) were observed in older adults using ATV, 3TC, and FTC, no differences in PK were apparent between young and older adults for ABC and EFV, with no estimation possible for ZDV. Exposure to 3TC, TDF, FTC, ATV, LPV, and RTV increases with age, while exposure to ABC and EFV appears to be unaffected.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of DNAm for MCI and AD, both individually and in combination with well-established AD biosignatures. A total of 1,891 blood samples from Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) studies were used to identify potential candidate DNAm biomarkers. Multimodal clinical data from 635 samples (normal control (NC), n = 193; MCI, n = 352; AD, n = 90) in the TADPOLE dataset were utilized to construct eight different classification models using a graph convolutional network, a machine learning framework. After feature selection, 17 DNAm sites were selected for subsequent analysis. Remarkable differences in DNAm levels were observed at the screened DNAm loci in all three cohorts. Adopting DNAm features into multimodal models significantly improved the classification performance for three dichotomous subtasks (NC vs. non-NC, MCI vs. non-MCI, and AD vs. non-AD), especially when combined with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) features for NC (area under the curve (AUC): 0.8534) and MCI classification (AUC: 0.7675). A weak correlation between DNAm and both magnetic resonance imaging and CSF features in the NC and MCI cohorts suggests good complementarity between modalities (correlation coefficient ≤0.2).

While models like the Model-for-End-Stage-Liver-Disease (MELD) predict 90-day mortality on the waiting list, they do not predict post-LT survival accurately. There is a need for predictive models that can forecast post-LT survival beyond the immediate period after transplantation. This study introduces new temporal variation features for predicting post-LT survival during the waiting list period. Cox Proportional-Hazards regression (CoxPH), Random Survival Forest (RSF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB) models are utilized, along with patient demographics and waiting list duration. Data from 716 LT patients from the University of Minnesota CTSI (2011-2021) are used to develop, evaluate, and compare post-LT survival prediction models. The temporal variation features, particularly when combined with the RSF model, proved most effective in predicting post-LT survival, with a C-index of 0.71 and an IBS of 0.151. This outperformed the predictive capability of the most recent MELD score, which had a C-index of <0.51 in the same cohort. Incorporating temporal variation features with the RSF model enhances long-term post-LT survival predictions. These insights can assist clinicians and patients in making more informed decisions about organ allocation and understanding the utility of LT, ultimately leading to improved patient outcomes.","2024","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

Automated brain segmentation techniques were utilized to obtain the standardized volume of each brain structure (the ratio of the absolute volume of brain structure to the whole brain volume). The standardized volumes of each brain structure in the two groups were statistically compared, and the volume data of brain areas with significant differences were combined with ML methods to diagnose and predict ASD patients. Compared with the TD group, the volumes of the right lateral orbitofrontal cortex, right medial orbitofrontal cortex, right pars opercularis, right pars triangularis, left hippocampus, bilateral parahippocampal gyrus, left fusiform gyrus, right superior temporal gyrus, bilateral insula, bilateral inferior parietal cortex, right precuneus cortex, bilateral putamen, left pallidum, and right thalamus were significantly increased in the ASD group (P< 0.05).

To date, it has been recommended that DASA:YV scores are interpreted in a linear manner, with high scores indicating a greater level of risk and therefore need more assertive and immediate intervention. This study re-analyses an existing data set using contemporary robust data analytic procedures to examine the predictive validity of the DASA:YV, and to determine appropriate risk bands. Mixed effect logistic regression models were used to determine whether the DASA:YV predicted aggression when the observations are correlated. Two approaches were employed to identify and test novel DASA:YV risk bands, where (1) three risk bands as previously generated for the adult DASA were used as a starting point to consider recategorising the DASA:YV into three risk bands, and (2) using a decision tree analysis method known as Chi-square automated interaction detection to produce risk bands. There was no statistically significant difference between a four and three category of risk band. AUC values were 0.85 for the four- and three-category options. A three-category approach is recommended for the DASA:YV. The new risk bands may assist nursing staff by providing more accurate categorisation of risk state.

Three sepsis-related datasets (E-MTAB-4421 and E-MTAB-4451 as training sets and GSE185263 as a validation set) were collected, and differentially expressed m7G-related genes were analyzed between survivors and non-survivors. Lethality-related m7G signature genes were then screened using machine learning methods, followed by the construction of a survival recognition model. Additionally, differences in immune cell distribution were determined and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different subtypes were analyzed. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to select important modules and related hub genes. In total, 10 differentially expressed m7G-related genes were identified between the survivors and non-survivors, and after further analysis, EIF4G3, EIF4E3, NSUN2, NUDT4, and GEMIN5 were identified as the optimal lethality-related m7G genes. A survival status diagnostic model was then constructed with a combined AUC of 0.678. Fifteen types of immune cells were significantly different between survivors and non-survivors. Sepsis samples were classified into two subtypes, with 22 types of immune cells showing significant differences. Subsequently, 1707 DEGs were identified between the two subtypes, which were significantly enriched in 91 GO terms and 16 KEGG pathways. Finally, the green module with |correlation| > 0.3 was found to be closely related to the subtypes and survival status; further, the top10 hub genes were obtained.

This study leverages multimodal data from substance-naïve youth enrolled in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study® (n=11,694). Early initiation was defined as consuming a full standard drink containing alcohol prior to age 16. Propensity scores were used to match alcohol initiators (n=348) with demographically similar non-initiators at a 1:2 ratio (n=696). Independent logistic regressions were conducted for each domain followed by additive, hierarchical models. The model of contextual factors (pseudo-R2=0.086, AUC=0.67) outperformed inhibition control (pseudo-R2=0.021, AUC=0.58) and reward sensitivity measures (pseudo-R2=0.020, AUC=0.59). The hierarchical model containing all measures (pseudo-R2=0.106, AUC=0.69) did not significantly improve the model of contextual factors alone (p>0.05). Examples of significant predictors (p<0.05) include externalizing behaviors, number of substances known, and non-religious alcohol sipping. Contextual risk factors were the strongest predictors of early alcohol use; however, more work is needed to understand the causal nature of this relationship. Measures of inhibition control and reward sensitivity were not adequate in distinguishing initiators from non-initiators.

Exclusion of confounding biological variables (male factor infertility and maternal age ≥35 years) improved AUC up to 14%, primarily due to increased specificity. AI score correlated with size of the zona pellucida and perivitelline space, and ooplasm appearance. AI score also correlated with blastocyst expansion grade and morphological quality. The sum of AI scores from oocytes in group culture images predicted the formation of two or more usable blastocysts (AUC 0.77).

In phase 2, upon administering CD-CAT.v2 on 210 patients, 22 items were removed having low correlation values (R < 0.4) with SDE. Finally, a 13-item tool (CD-CAT.v3; α = 0.84) was obtained with high criterion validity with SDE ( r = 0.806, P < 0.001), moderate convergent validity with celiac disease adherence test ( r = 0.602, P = 0.007), and moderate to weak correlation with urine gluten immunogenic peptides ( r = 0.46, P = 0.001) and IgA anti-tTG Ab ( r = 0.39, P = 0.008), respectively. The final 13-item tool also strongly correlated with SDE ( r = 0.78, P < 0.001) in an independent validation cohort of 70 patients with CeD. Principal component analysis identified 3 relevant subscales with a cumulative variance of 62%. The sensitivity and specificity of CD-CAT.v3 were 80% and 91%, respectively, with an area under curve of 0.905 with SDE. The obtained cutoff score of <19 from the receiver operating characteristic curve was further categorized as 13 = excellent, 14-18 = very good, 19-28 = average, and >28 = poor adherence to GFD. CD-CAT is a new and rapid tool for monitoring dietary adherence to GFD with high sensitivity and specificity, which can be administered by both physicians and dietitians.","2024","The American journal of gastroenterology"
818,"39656118","The QIBA Profile for Dynamic Susceptibility Contrast MRI Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers for Assessing Gliomas.","The dynamic susceptibility contrast (DSC) MRI measures of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV) play a central role in monitoring therapeutic response and disease progression in patients with gliomas. Previous investigations have demonstrated promise of using rCBV in classifying tumor grade, elucidating tumor viability after therapy, and differentiating pseudoprogression and pseudoresponse. However, the quantification and reproducibility of rCBV measurements across patients, devices, and software remain a critical barrier to routine or clinical trial use of longitudinal DSC MRI in patients with gliomas. To address this limitation, the RSNA DSC MRI Biomarker Committee of the Quantitative Imaging Biomarkers Alliance developed a Profile that defines statistics-based claims for the precision of longitudinal measurements. Although rCBV is the clinical marker of interest, the Profile focused on the reproducibility of the measured quantitative imaging biomarker, which is the area under the contrast agent concentration-time curve (AUC) normalized by the mean value of normal-appearing contralateral white matter tissue (tissue-normalized AUC values). Based on previous reports of within-subject coefficient of variation (wCV) in the tissue-normalized AUC values for enhancing gliomas (wCV = 0.31), an increase of 182% or more with respect to the baseline tissue-normalized AUC value indicates that an increase has occurred with 95% confidence. In contrast, a decrease of 64% or more with respect to baseline suggests that a decrease has occurred with 95% confidence. Similarly, an increase of 399% or more in the tissue-normalized AUC values in normal brain gray matter tissue (wCV = 0.40) suggests that an increase has occurred with 95% confidence, whereas a decrease of 80% or more with respect to baseline suggests that a decrease has occurred with 95% confidence. This article provides the rationale for these claims and the compliance activities needed to achieve these claims. Potential updates to incorporate new data based on advances in technology and clinical care in the Profile are also discussed.","2024","Radiology"

PE prediction using routinely collected data has the advantage of being widely applicable, particularly in low-resource settings. Early intervention for high-risk women might reduce PE incidence and related complications. We aimed to replicate our machine learning (ML) published work predicting another maternal condition (gestational diabetes) to (1) predict PE using routine health data, (2) identify the optimal ML model, and (3) compare it with logistic regression approach. Data were from a large health service network with 48,250 singleton pregnancies between January 2016 and June 2021. Supervised ML models were employed. Maternal clinical and medical characteristics were the feature variables (predictors), and a 70/30 data split was used for training and testing the model. Predictive performance was assessed using area under the curve (AUC) and calibration plots. Shapley value analysis assessed the contribution of feature variables. The random forest approach provided excellent discrimination with an AUC of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.82-0.86) and highest prediction accuracy (0.79); however, the calibration curve (slope of 1.21, 95% CI 1.13-1.30) was acceptable only for a threshold of 0.3 or less. The next best approach was extreme gradient boosting, which provided an AUC of 0.77 (95% CI: 0.76-0.79) and well-calibrated (slope of 0.93, 95% CI 0.85-1.01). Logistic regression provided good discrimination performance with an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.74-0.76) and perfect calibration. Nulliparous, pre-pregnancy body mass index, previous pregnancy with prior PE, maternal age, family history of hypertension, and pre-existing hypertension and diabetes were the top-ranked features in Shapley value analysis. Two ML models created the highest-performing prediction using routinely collected data to identify women at high risk of PE, with acceptable discrimination. However, to confirm this result and also examine model generalisability, external validation studies are needed in other settings, utilising standardised prognostic factors.","2024","International journal of medical informatics"

However, previous efforts have been limited to populations living in predominantly higher income, developed countries. This study aimed to extend the reach of precision MHC systems by developing and testing a feasible and readily implementable algorithm for identifying patients at risk of nonresponse to routinely delivered psychotherapy in Chile, a developing country in Latin America. Data were derived from a community-based, randomized trial that tested the effects of progress feedback on naturalistically delivered psychotherapy outcome. Patients were 547 adults who were consecutively admitted to an outpatient clinic in Santiago, Chile. Treatment response was defined using norms for reliable improvement on the Outcome Questionnaire-30. Based on 10 sociodemographic and seven clinical predictors, we trained elastic net and random forest algorithms on a randomly selected training set (70%; n = 384). The best performing algorithm was tested on a hold-out sample (30%; n = 163). Reliable improvement was achieved in 42% of the cases. A random forest algorithm demonstrated moderate performance in the hold-out sample (area under the curve = .74, Brier score = .21), correctly identifying 73% of the patients who did not respond. This study developed a predictive algorithm that demonstrated moderate accuracy in identifying patients at risk of nonresponse to naturalistic psychotherapy in Chile, using routinely assessed and easy-to-collect sociodemographic and clinical information. Using such tools may represent one step toward reducing the multilayered outcome disparities faced by individuals receiving MHC in socioeconomically disadvantaged contexts.

(1) Face and content validity, and visual and haptic fidelity; (2) Construct validity; (3) Predictive and discriminative utility of quantitative performance thresholds. Participants performed unilateral lumbar decompressions on high-fidelity spinal simulators that replicate the bony and soft tissue anatomy along with physiological processes such as bleeding and CSF leaks. Operating times, measured from first surgical action to either self-perceived satisfactory decompression or the end of allocated time, were recorded. The performance was also assessed independently by 2 blinded spinal subspecialist neurosurgeons using OSATS, a validated surgical assessment tool that utilizes 5-point scales on a variety of technical domains to grade the overall technical proficiency. Validity and fidelity were assessed by expert neurosurgeons using quantitative questionnaires. Construct validity was assessed by ordinal regression of simulation performance against real-world surgical grade and portfolio. Thresholds of expert status by simulation performance was established, and their predictive and discriminative utility assessed by crossvalidation accuracy and AUC-ROC. Operating time and expert assessments of simulation performance (OSATS) were strong and significant prdictors of surrogate markers of real-world surgical ability. The thresholds for expert status were operating time of 15 minutes and modified OSATS score of 15/20. These thresholds predicted expert status with 84.2% and 71.4% accuracy respectively. Strong discriminative ability was demonstrated by AUC-ROC of 0.95 and 0.83 respectively. All expert surgeons agreed that RealSpine simulators demonstrate high face validity, and high visual and haptic fidelity, with overall scores showing statistically significant agreement on these items (all scores at least 4/5, p<.0001). There was less consensus on content validity, but with still significant overall agreement (average score: 3.75/5, p=.023). Real-world surgical ability and experience can be accurately predicted by defining objective quantitative thresholds on high-fidelity simulations. The thresholds established here, along with other data presented in this paper, may inform objectives and standards to be established in a spinal surgical training curriculum.","2024","The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society"

Furthermore, we investigated the optimal cutoff values for preoperative radiographic parameters, thereby validating the appropriate inclusion criteria for prearthritic/kinematic unicompartmental knee arthroplasty (prearthritic-UKA). We retrospectively analyzed 123 patients who underwent medial UKA. We measured the HKA on VSR, termed sHKA. The aHKA was calculated by subtracting the lateral distal femoral angle from the medial proximal tibial angle. Prearthritic-UKA was defined as a postoperative HKA angle within 3° of the aHKA. We divided the patients into the prearthritic-UKA and non-prearthritic-UKA groups. To assess whether the aHKA serves as a surrogate for VSR, Spearman's rank correlations were performed among the radiographic parameters. These radiographic parameters calculated the proper criteria for prearthritic-UKA using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and logistic regression analysis. Overall, 59 patients were classified into the prearthritic-UKA group. The aHKA was larger than the sHKA and exhibited no significant correlation with the sHKA. ROC analysis revealed that the cutoff values of aHKA for detecting overcorrected UKA (i.e., postoperative HKA - aHKA >3°) was -5.0°. Similarly, the cutoff values for detecting undercorrected UKA (i.e., postoperative HKA - aHKA <-3°) were -3°. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the aHKA was significantly associated with prearthritic-UKA. The aHKA was not identified as a surrogate for the sHKA. Comprehensive preoperative radiographic assessment, including both aHKA and VSR, is crucial for optimizing UKA outcomes and minimizing risks of misalignment.","2024","The Knee"

This international initiative consisted of four phases: (1) item generation, (2) item reduction, (3) criteria development, and (4) validation of the AxJSpA criteria by an independent team of experts in an internationally representative validation cohort. These criteria are intended to be used on youth with a physician diagnosis of juvenile SpA and for whom axial disease is suspected. Item generation consisted of a systematic literature review and a free-listing exercise using input from international physicians, which collectively resulted in 108 items. After the item reduction exercise and expert panel input, 37 items remained for further consideration. The final AxJSpA criteria domains included the following: imaging of active inflammation, imaging of structural lesions, pain chronicity, pain pattern, pain location, stiffness, and genetics. The most heavily weighted domains were active inflammation and structural lesions on imaging. Imaging typical of sacroiliitis was deemed necessary, but not sufficient, to classify a youth with AxJSpA. The threshold for classification of AxJSpA was a score of ≥55 (out of 100). When tested in the validation data set, the final criteria had a specificity of 97.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 91.4%-99.7%), sensitivity of 64.3% (95% CI 54.9%-73.1%), and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% CI 0.76%-0.86%). The new AxJSpA classification criteria require an entry criterion and a physician diagnosis of juvenile SpA and include seven weighted domains.

This study aimed to investigate the potential of ultrasound-based radiomics and clinical characteristics in non-invasively distinguishing between low tumor burden (1-2 positive nodes) and high tumor burden (more than 2 positive nodes) in patients with node-positive breast cancer. A total of 215 patients with node-positive breast cancer, who underwent preoperative ultrasound examinations, were enrolled in this study. Among these patients, 144 cases were allocated to the training set, 37 cases to the validation set, and 34 cases to the testing set. Postoperative histopathology was used to determine the status of ALN tumor burden. The region of interest for breast cancer was delineated on the ultrasound image. Nine models were developed to predict high ALN tumor burden, employing a combination of three feature screening methods and three machine learning classifiers. Ultimately, the optimal model was selected and tested on both the validation and testing sets. In addition, clinical characteristics were screened to develop a clinical model. Furthermore, Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) values were utilized to provide explanations for the machine learning model. During the validation and testing sets, the models demonstrated area under the curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.577 to 0.733 and 0.583 to 0.719, and accuracies ranging from 64.9% to 75.7% and 64.7% to 70.6%, respectively. Ultimately, the Boruta_XGB model, comprising five radiomics features, was selected as the final model. The AUC values of this model for distinguishing low from high tumor burden were 0.828, 0.715, and 0.719 in the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively, demonstrating its superiority over the clinical model.

The study aims to validate the CT criteria for PLC injury externally. Three level 1 trauma centers enrolled 614 consecutive patients with acute thoracolumbar fractures (T1-L5) who received CT and MRI. Three reviewers from each center assessed CT for facet joint malalignment, horizontal laminar fracture, spinous process fracture, and interspinous widening and MRI for disrupted PLC, defined as black stripe discontinuity. The primary outcome is the diagnostic accuracy of CT criteria (0, 1, ≥2 findings) in detecting disrupted PLC on MRI using all CT readings. A subgroup analysis was performed for each participating center and reviewer. The inter-reader agreement on PLC status on MRI and CT criteria was assessed using Fleiss Kappa (k). The positive predictive value for PLC injury was 0 findings 3%, single positive CT 43%, and ≥2 CT findings in 94%. The accuracy measures were consistent across various centers and reviewers. The area under the curve for ≥1 CT finding in detecting PLC injury ranged from 90% to 97%, indicating excellent discrimination for all centers. The inter-reader k on PLC status by MRI and overall CT findings was substantial (k > 0.60). This study externally validates the previously proposed CT criteria for PLC injury. A total of ≥2 positive CT findings or 0 CT findings can be used as criteria for a disrupted PLC (B-type injury) or intact PLC (A-type injuries), respectively, without added MRI. A single CT finding implies indeterminate PLC status and the need for further MRI assessment. The CT criteria will potentially guide MRI indications and treatment decisions for neurologically intact thoracolumbar burst fractures.","2024","Neurosurgery"

This study integrates patient-specific information to develop learning-based models to predict the incidence of AF following NSCLC chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and evaluates these models using institutional and external datasets. Institutional and external patient cohorts consisted of 321 and 187 NSCLC datasets who received definitive CRT, including 17 and 6 AF incidences, respectively. The network input had 159 features with clinical, dosimetry, and diagnostic. The class imbalance was mitigated by synthetic minority oversampling technique. To handle various types of input features, machine learning-based model adopted an intervention technique that chose one feature with the largest weight at each dosimetry sub-group in feature selection process, while deep learning-based model employed a hybrid architecture assigning different types of networks to corresponding input paths. Performance was assessed by area under the curve (AUC). The key features were investigated for the machine and deep learning-based models. The hybrid deep learning model outperformed the machine learning-based algorithm in internal validation (AUC: 0.817 vs. 0.801) and produced more consistent performance in external validation (AUC: 0.806 vs. 0.776). Importantly, maximum dose to heart and sinoatrial node (SAN) were found to be the key features for both learning-based models in external and internal validations.

Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have emerged as a crucial treatment option for patients with advanced NSCLC. However, only a subset of patients experience clinical benefit from ICIs. Therefore, identifying biomarkers that can predict response to ICIs is imperative for optimising patient selection. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) images of NSCLC patients were obtained from the local cohort (n = 106) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) (n = 899). We developed an ICI-related pathological prognostic signature (ir-PPS) based on H&E stained histopathology images to predict prognosis in NSCLC patients treated with ICIs using deep learning. To accomplish this, we employed a modified ResNet model (ResNet18-PG), a widely-used deep learning architecture well-known for its effectiveness in handling complex image recognition tasks. Our modifications include a progressive growing strategy to improve the stability of model training and the use of the AdamW optimiser, which enhances the optimisation process by adjusting the learning rate based on training dynamics. The deep learning model, ResNet18-PG, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.918 and a recall of 0.995 on the local cohort. The ir-PPS effectively risk-stratified NSCLC patients. Patients in the low-risk group (n = 40) had significantly improved progression-free survival (PFS) after ICI treatment compared to those in the high-risk group (n = 66, log-rank P = 0.004, hazard ratio (HR) = 3.65, 95%CI: 1.75-7.60). The ir-PPS demonstrated good discriminatory power for predicting 6-month PFS (AUC = 0.750), 12-month PFS (AUC = 0.677), and 18-month PFS (AUC = 0.662). The low-risk group exhibited increased expression of immune checkpoint molecules, cytotoxicity-related genes, an elevated abundance of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes, and enhanced activity in immune stimulatory pathways. The ir-PPS signature derived from H&E images using deep learning could predict ICIs prognosis in NSCLC patients. The ir-PPS provides a novel imaging biomarker that may help select optimal candidates for ICIs therapy in NSCLC.","2024","British journal of cancer"

This study aimed to validate surgical skill rating and error annotations in suturing gestures to inform the development and evaluation of AI models. SAR-RARP50 open data set was blindly, independently annotated at the gesture level in Robotic-Assisted Radical Prostatectomy (RARP) suturing.

Participants self-reported clinical and social risk factors during first trimester initiation of app use and completed voluntary depression screenings in each trimester. Several machine learning algorithms were applied to self-reported data, including a novel algorithm for causal discovery. Training and test datasets were built from a randomized 80/20 data split. Models were evaluated on their predictive accuracy and their simplicity (i.e., fewest variables required for prediction). Among participants, 78% identified as white with an average age of 30 [IQR 26-34]; 61% had income ≥ $50,000; 70% had a college degree or higher; and 49% were nulliparous. All models accurately predicted first time moderate-severe depression using first trimester baseline data (AUC 0.74-0.89, sensitivity 0.35-0.81, specificity 0.78-0.95).

A training set based on small RNA sequencing technology was performed to identify piRNAs in endomyocardial tissue (n = 8) and serum samples (n = 40) from patients following heart transplantation. A validation set of the potential piRNAs identified in the training study was conducted in an independent larger cohort for the detection of acute cellular rejection (ACR, n = 105) and antibody-mediated rejection (AMR, n = 61). We identified 20,292 piRNAs in endomyocardial tissue and 24,602 piRNAs in serum samples from patients following heart transplantation. We identified 7 piRNAs with a coincident expression profile in both types of samples and potential capacity for the noninvasive detection of cardiac rejection. Validation in a large independent cohort demonstrated that a panel of these piRNAs showed excellent performance for detecting grade ≥2R ACR (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] = 0.819; p < 0.0001) and grade 1R ACR (AUC = 0.721; p = 0.001).

It occurs in complex and crowded environments, where amino acids (AAs) are vital components. We have found that AAs render the net interaction between proteins more repulsive. Here, we find that some AAs efficiently suppress LLPS in test tubes (in vitro). We then screen all the proteinogenic AAs and find that three specific AAs, including proline, glutamine, and glycine, significantly suppressed the formation of stress granules (SGs) in U2OS and HeLa cell lines (in vivo) irrespective of stress types. We also observe the effect in primary fibroblast cells, a viable cell model for neurodegenerative disorders. Kinetic studies by live-cell microscopy show that the presence of AAs not only slows down the formation but also decreases the saturating number and prevents the coalescence of SGs. We finally use sedimentation-diffusion equilibrium analytical ultracentrifuge (SE-AUC) to demonstrate that the suppression effects of AAs on LLPS may be due to their modulation in protein-protein and RNA-RNA interactions. Overall, this study reveals an underappreciated role of cellular AAs, which may find biomedical applications, especially in treating SG-associated diseases.","2024","Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America"

This study aimed to investigate the effect of a dose of insoluble fibers that meets dietary recommendations on postprandial hyperglycemia in T2DM patients. This is a randomized crossover clinical trial. Nineteen T2DM men randomly ate a balanced breakfast either without (Control) or with prior consumption of insoluble fibers (5.8 g) in the form of 15 g of raw wheat bran (RWB). Glycemia was measured at fasting and 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, and 120 min postprandially. Markers of taste intensity and palatability were assessed after breakfast intake. The glucose peak rise of 87 mg/dL and the incremental area under the curve (AUC) elicited by the breakfast were decreased by RWB (15.80 % and 23.14 %, respectively). Time-to-glucose-peak did not differ between groups. The addition of the RWB to the meal decreased its level of creaminess and tasty and increased the sourness and bitterness. The postprandial hyperglycemia in T2DM patients in response to complex carbohydrates was decreased by prior intake of a recommended dose of raw insoluble fibers. This antihyperglycemic effect is in accordance with the acarbose-like property of raw insoluble fibres, but not of heated ones (e.g., bread and pasta), to inhibit the activities of the carbohydrate-digesting enzymes alpha-glucosidase/alpha-amylase.

Multivariate analysis revealed significantly higher short- and long-term postdischarge mortality for patients with high age SI (HR: 5.44 (2.73-10.85), 5.34(3.18-8.96)), high age MSI (HR: 4.17(1.78-9.79), 5.75(3.20-10.31)) compared to counterparts with low indices. DCA observed comparable clinical usefulness for predicting short-term postdischarge mortality. Furthermore, age SI and age MSI were not significantly associated with postdischarge prognosis for patients who received fibrinolysis. Age SI and age MSI were valuable instruments to identify high postdischarge mortality with comparable predictive ability compared with the classic scores, especially for events within 30 days after hospitalization.","2024","Annals of medicine"

Differences in the uptake of primary and metastatic foci on PET among the groups were analyzed. A total of 42 patients were enrolled: 14 in each group. In primary foci, the mean PSMA uptake in the DA group was lower than that in the AA group (14.2 ± 9.6 vs. 27.1 ± 14.3, P = 0.009) and greater than that in the BP group (14.2 ± 9.6 vs. 4.7 ± 1.3, P = 0.003). The AUCs of the DA-AA ROC curve and DA-BP ROC curve were 0.781 and 0.872, respectively. The median PSMA uptake of metastatic lymph nodes in the DA group was lower than that in the AA group (5.6 vs. 14.2, P = 0.033), with no significant difference in metastatic bone lesions (9.5 vs 19.1, P = 0.485). No significant difference was found in the FDG uptake of primary and metastatic foci between the DA and AA groups (P > 0.05). Prostatic DA has greater PSMA uptake than BP diseases, but lower uptake in both primary foci and metastatic lymph nodes than AA on PSMA PET/CT, aiding in the differential diagnosis of DA, AA and BP diseases. Clinicians should combine traditional imaging with PSMA PET/CT to avoid underestimating the clinical stage of DA patients.","2024","Urologic oncology"

A prospective, single-center cohort study. A tertiary hospital setting. A total of 185 patients with acute ischemic stroke, capable of walking 10 m with or without a gait aid by day 7 postadmission. From these patients, 10,804 pairs of consecutive footfalls were included for analysis. Not applicable. The dependent variable was a 3-month poor functional outcome, defined as modified Rankin scale score ≥2. For independent variables, 65 clinical variables including demographics, anthropometrics, comorbidities, laboratory data, questionnaires, and drug history were included. Gait function was evaluated using a pressure-sensitive mat. Time-series COP data were parameterized into spatial and temporal variables and analyzed with logistic regression and 2 ML models (light gradient-boosting machine and multilayer perceptron [MLP]). We derived GAIT-AI output scores from the best-performing model analyzed COP data and constructed multivariable logistic regression models using clinical variables and the GAIT scores. Among the included patients, 70 (37.8%) experienced unfavorable outcomes. The MLP model demonstrated the highest predictive performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.799. Multivariable logistic regression identified age, initial National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, and initial Fall Efficacy Scale-International as associated factors with unfavorable outcomes. The combined multivariable logistic regression incorporating COP-derived output scores improved the AUROC to 0.812. Gait function, assessed through COP analysis, serves as a significant predictor of functional outcome in patients with acute ischemic stroke. ML-based COP analysis, when combined with clinical data, enhances the prediction of poor functional outcomes.","2024","Archives of physical medicine and rehabilitation"

The goal of this study was to identify differentially expressed genes in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and examine their potential role in tumorigenesis and metastasis. The transcriptomic profiles of PDAC and non-tumorous tissue samples were derived from the gene expression omnibus (GEO), which is a public repository. The GEO2R tool was used to further derive differentially expressed genes from those profiles. In this study, a total of 68 genes were derived from upregulated PDAC genes in three or more transcriptomic profiles and were considered PDAC gene sets. The identified PDAC gene sets were examined in the molecular signatures database (MSigDB) for ontological investigation, which revealed that these genes were involved in the extracellular matrix and associated with the cell adhesion process in PDAC tumorigenesis. The gene set enrichment analysis showed greater enrichment scores for the gene sets. Moreover, the identified gene sets were examined for protein-protein interaction using the STRING database. Based on functional k-means clustering, the following three functional cluster groups were identified in this study: extracellular matrix/cell adhesion, metabolic, and mucus secretion-related protein groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve revealed greater specificity and sensitivity for these cluster genes in predicting PDAC tumorigenesis and metastases. In addition, the expression of the cluster genes affects the overall survival rate of PDAC patients. Using the cancer genome atlas (TCGA) database, the associations between expression levels and clinicopathological features were validated. Overall, the genes identified in this study appear to be critical in PDAC development and can serve as potential diagnostic and prognostic targets for pancreatic cancer treatment.","2024","Cancers"

These changes can impact mare fertility and maternal and neonatal health. This is the first comparison of body condition, regional adiposity, insulin and glucose dynamics, lipid metabolism, and cytokine production between lactating and non-lactating mares before, during pregnancy, and early postpartum. Twelve pregnancies from 9 broodmares, five nonlactating (NL) and seven lactating (L), were used. Evaluations were performed on the day of ovulation, at 55, 110, 165, 220, 275, and 330 days of gestation (D55, D110, D165, D220, D275, D330) and 21 days postpartum (21pp). Mares in the L group had lower basal insulin and glucose at the beginning of pregnancy, smaller area under the curve of insulin and glucose, and greater insulin sensitivity and glucose tolerance. Resistin was higher in D110 and D165 than in D0, D275, 330 and 21pp, while leptin was higher in D55, and in D110, at D110 it was equal to D0, D220, and D275, but higher than at D330 and D21pp. As for the groups, L presented lower body condition score (BCS), crest neck score (CNS), rump fat thickness (RUM), basal insulin, glucose area under the curve (AUCg), MIRG and higher RISQI, adiponectin and tumor necrosis factor (TNFα). There was no effect over time in non-esterified fatty acids (NEFA) concentrations between the L mares; in the NL, D275 presented higher concentrations than those of D0, D55, and D110, which in turn were equal to the other time points; there were higher concentrations in NL mares than L in samples D165 and D275. In conclusion, a different metabolic profile during pregnancy was detected, and NL mares were closer to the metabolic threshold for the occurrence of metabolic syndrome during pregnancy. Understanding the impacts of these differences on mare's health and their offspring's future is fundamental as most of our recipient mares for embryo transfer are non-lactating. Therefore, we suggest that further studies be performed to evaluate lactation's influence on mares' metabolic parameters.","2024","Theriogenology"

Patients were categorized by PADUA score (low-, moderate-, high-complexity) and MAP score (low-, intermediate-, high-grade). Evaluated outcomes included operative time (OT), warm ischemia time (WIT), estimated blood loss (EBL), drainage duration, postoperative length of stay, and absolute change in estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) at three months post-surgery, along with intra- and postoperative complications. RAPN outperformed LPN in the low-complexity group by lowering WIT (P = 0.022) and absolute eGFR change (P = 0.011). For moderate-complexity group, RAPN reduced WIT (P = 0.021), absolute eGFR change (P = 0.027), and postoperative length of stay (P = 0.008). In the high-complexity group, RAPN reduced OT (P = 0.015), WIT (P = 0.023), EBL (P = 0.036), absolute eGFR change (P = 0.024), and postoperative length of stay (P = 0.019). Drainage duration showed no significant differences across groups (P = 0.442, P = 0.327, P = 0.260). RAPN incurred significantly higher total costs than LPN across groups (P < 0.001). ROC analysis suggested PADUA and MAP scores as reliable predictors of postoperative complications in RAPN (AUC = 0.880,0.828) and LPN (AUC = 0.757,0.702). RAPN provides significant advantages over LPN in managing complex renal tumors (PADUA score ≥ 10), significantly in reducing OT, WIT, EBL, and absolute eGFR change at three months post-surgery, while minimizing postoperative stay.

Whether the prehospital Pandemic Respiratory Infection Emergency System Triage (PRIEST) score can accurately predict the short-term prognosis of them remains unknown. Accordingly, we aimed to assess the performance of prehospital PRIEST in predicting the 30-day mortality of patients. This retrospective study evaluated the accuracy of five physiological parameters scores commonly used in prehospital disposal for mortality prediction using receiver operating characteristic curves and decision curve analysis. Cox proportional hazard regression analysis was conducted to evaluate independent predictors associated with the 30-day mortality. A total of 231 patients were included in this study, among which 23 cases (10.0%) died within 30 days after admission. Compared with survivor patients, non-survivor patients had greater numbers of comorbidities, signs and symptoms, complications, and physiological parameters scores and required greater prehospital care (p < 0.05). When the PRIEST score was >12, the sensitivity was 91.3%, and the specificity was 77.4%. We found that the area under the curve of the PRIEST score (0.887, p < 0.05) for mortality prediction was greater than that of the quick Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (0.724), CRB-65 (0.780), Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (0.809), and National Early Warning Score 2 (0.838). Moreover, prehospital PRIEST scores were positively correlated with numbers of comorbidities and numbers of prehospital treatment measures. The 30-day survival rate of patients with PRIEST scores ≤12 (98.8%) significantly exceeded that of patients with PRIEST scores >12 (69.1%) (p < 0.001). Prehospital PRIEST scores >12 (HR = 7.409) was one of the independent predictors of the 30-day mortality. The PRIEST can accurately, quickly, and conveniently predict the 30-day mortality of COVID-19 patients with pneumonia in the prehospital phase and can guide their initial risk stratification and treatment.","2024","Annals of medicine"

This retrospective study included patients who underwent CE-CT before pancreatectomy. ECV map was created by subtracting unenhanced from equilibrium-phase images. We assessed the relationship between pancreatic ECV, the histopathological grade of fibrosis at the pancreatic resection margin, and the occurrence of POPF. Among the 107 patients included, 66 underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) and 41 underwent distal pancreatectomy (DP). The median ECV at the pancreatic resection margin was 22.5 %. Pancreatic ECV significantly correlated with the histopathological grade of pancreatic fibrosis (ρ = 0.689; p < 0.001).

Potential key genes were obtained by intersecting DEGs with M2 macrophage-related module genes (M2MRGs), and finally the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Rats were exposed to hypoxia condition (10 % O2) for 4 weeks to induce PH. Subsequently, potential key genes with AUC>0.7 were analyzed by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and Western blot using normoxia and hypoxia rat lungs. We knocked down EPHA3 in Raw264.7 cells and detected the protein expression of M2 macrophage markers including arginase 1 (ARG1) and interleukin 10 (IL-10), phospho-protein kinase B (P-Akt), and protein kinase B (Akt) to explore the downstream pathways of EPHA3. Seven potential hub genes were detected by intersecting M2MRGs and DEGs. Six genes with AUC values above 0.7 were used for further exploration. The expression of EPHA3 mRNA and protein was significantly more upregulated in rats with hypoxia than in rats with normoxia.

This study aimed to identify genes associated with multiple PCD pathways in dendritic cells within the thyroid tissue of patients with HT. The single-cell RNA-sequencing dataset HRA001684 was obtained from the National Genomics Data Center (NGDC) to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) scores for PCD-related genes. Additionally, mRNA sequencing datasets GSE138198 and HRA001684 were sourced from the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) and NGDC, respectively. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified by comparing normal and HT groups in GSE138198 and HRA001684. The intersection of these DEGs with PCD-related genes led to the identification of 17 PCD-related DEGs(PCDDEGs). AUC scores revealed that DCs in HT exhibited significantly elevated levels of necroptosis, ferroptosis, pyroptosis, autophagy, and PANoptosis, expressing six key PCDDEGs: TNFAIP3, CYBB, PTPN6, STAT1, TGFB1, and NLRP3. These genes displayed an AUC>0.8 for HT in the GSE29315, GSE138198, and HRA001684 datasets, confirming their diagnostic accuracy. Moreover, their expression was positively correlated with the serum levels of thyroid peroxidase and thyroglobulin antibodies, while the expression of all PCDDEGs was negatively correlated with the abundance of thyroid follicular epithelial cells. qRT-PCR, WB, IHC, and IF experiments further confirmed the differences in PCDDEGs gene and protein levels in HT patients. These findings highlight the crucial role of DCs in mediating PCD within the thyroid tissues of HT patients.

However, there remains inconsistent results in terms of risk factors, and a prediction model for the accurate prediction of long COVID is still lacking. Cross-sectional study. In this retrospective study, a community population from the Futian District of Shenzhen, Guangdong Province, China, were included. Data were collected from September to December 2023 using an electronic questionnaire. Logistic regression analyses were used to identify predictors of long COVID. Pre-infection and post-infection prediction models (with/without post-infection characteristics) were developed, and the C-index was used to evaluate accuracy. In total, 420 patients infected COVID-19 were included. The prevalence of long COVID was 32.9 %. The most common symptoms of long COVID were weakness/fatigue, persistent cough and cognitive dysfunction. Independent predictors of long COVID included in the pre-infection model were age, long-term medication, and psychological problems such as stress and doing things without enthusiasm/interest before COVID-19 infection (C-index: 0.721). Independent predictors included in the post-infection model were age, inability to concentrate before COVID-19 infection, and symptoms of weakness/fatigue, abnormal smell/taste, diarrhoea, eye conjunctivitis and headache/dizziness during the acute-phase (C-index: 0.857). Age, psychological problems before COVID-19 infection and acute-phase symptoms were important risk factors of long COVID. Results from the pre-infection model provide guidance for non-infected individuals on how to prevent long COVID. Results from the post-infection model can be used to accurately predict individuals who are at high risk of long COVID and help design treatment plans for patients in the acute phase.","2024","Public health"

A predictive model integrating fat features and clinical factors was developed to guide individualized treatment. A retrospective analysis of 203 NMIBC patients from two medical centers was conducted. Abdominal CT images were analyzed using 3D Slicer software. Spearman correlation, logistic regression, and the Lasso algorithm were employed for data analysis. Predictive efficacy was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and decision curve analysis (DCA). Calibration was evaluated using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. Significant differences in abdominal fat characteristics were found between the recurrence and nonrecurrence groups. All fat features positively correlated with body mass index (BMI), with bilateral perirenal fat thickness (PrFT) showing superior predictive performance. Multivariate logistic regression identified independent predictors of early recurrence, including tumor number, early perfusion chemotherapy, left and right PrFT, and visceral fat area (VFA) at umbilical and renal hilum levels. The Lasso-based model achieved an AUC of 0.904, outperforming existing models. Abdominal fat characteristics, especially bilateral PrFT, strongly correlate with early recurrence in NMIBC. The Lasso-based model, integrating fat and clinical factors, offers superior predictive efficacy and could improve individualized treatment strategies.","2024","Clinical genitourinary cancer"

The aim of this study is to investigate if high-frequency ultrasound (US) can classify bone readiness in humans, using micro-CT as a reference standard to obtain bone mineral density (BMD) and bone volume fraction (BVTV) of healed sockets receiving ARP in humans. A total of 27 bone cores were harvested during the implant surgery from 24 patients who received prior extraction with ARP. US images were taken immediately before the implant surgery at a site co-registered with the tissue biopsy collection location, made possible with a specially designed guide, and then classified into 3 tiers using B-mode image criteria (1) favorable, (2) questionable, and (3) unfavorable. Bone mineral density (hydroxyapatite) and BVTV were obtained from micro-CT as the gold standard. Hydroxyapatite and BVTV were evaluated within the projected US slice plane and thresholded to favorable (>2200 mg/cm3; >0.45 mm3/mm3), questionable (1500-2200 mg/cm3; 0.4-0.45 mm3/mm3), and unfavorable (<1500 mg/cm3; <0.4 mm3/mm3). The present US B-mode classification inversely scales with BMD. Regression analysis showed a significant relation between US classification and BMD as well as BVTV. T-test analysis demonstrated a significant correlation between US reader scores and the gold standard. When comparing Tier 1 with the combination of Tier 2 and 3, US achieved a significant group differentiation relative to mean BMD (p = 0.004, true positive 66.7%, false positive 0%, true negative 100%, false negative 33.3%, specificity 100%, sensitivity 66.7%, receiver operating characteristics area under the curve 0.86). Similar results were found between US-derived tiers and BVTV.

Investigating blood-based protein biomarkers aims to simplify the diagnostic process and identify disease-associated changes before they can be seen by using imaging techniques. In this study, plasma and frozen whole blood cell pellets from NSCLC patients and healthy controls were processed using both classical and novel techniques to produce a unique set of four sample types from a single blood draw. These samples were analyzed using 12 immunoassays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to collectively screen 3974 proteins. Analysis of all fractions produced a set of 522 differentially expressed proteins, with conventional blood analysis (proteomic analysis of plasma) accounting for only 7 of the total. Boosted regression tree analysis of the differentially expressed proteins produced a panel of 13 proteins that were able to discriminate between controls and NSCLC patients, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.864 for the set. Our rapid and reproducible (<10% CV for technical replicates) blood preparation and analysis methods enabled the production of high-quality data from only 30 μL of complex samples that typically require significant fractionation prior to proteomic analysis.

We examined 303 patients who underwent esophagoscopy from January 2019 to December 2022 at a leading hospital in Anhui, known for its expertise in otorhinolaryngology-head and neck surgery. The patients were split into a modeling group and a validation group in a 7:3 ratio. Logistic regression analysis was employed to determine the risk factors for esophageal injury after undergoing esophagoscopy in patients with EFB. Based on these factors, a nomogram risk prediction model was developed and assessed using a goodness of fit test. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the type of foreign body, failure of gastroscopic retrieval, duration of lodgment, lodgment site, and presence of combined cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases were significant (p < 0.05) independent risk factors for esophageal injury following esophagoscopy for EFB. The area under the ROC curve for the training set was 0.850, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness of fit test resulted in a p value of 0.908. For the validation set, the area under the ROC curve was 0.848, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test gave a p value of 0.665. The calibration curve showed a close alignment between the predicted and observed values. The type of foreign body, duration of lodgment, lodgment site, previous failure of gastroscopic retrieval, and history of combined cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases are significant risk factors for esophageal injury following EFB esophagoscopy.

UHPLC-MS/MS analysis of untargeted serum samples for metabolic profiles. Multiple linear regression and Spearman's rank correlation analysis were used to determine associations between metabolites and clinical parameters. The sensitivity and specificity of the screened metabolites were also examined, along with their area under the curve. The metabolic signatures of patients with CAP infected by bacteria, viruses, and fungi were markedly different from those of controls. The abundances of 45, 56, and 79 metabolites were significantly unbalanced. Among these differential metabolites, 11, 13, and 29 were unique to the B-CAP, V-CAP, and F-CAP groups, respectively. Bacterial infections were the only known causes of disturbances in the pentose and glucuronate and aldarate and ascorbate metabolism interconversions metabolic pathway.

To address this need, we developed a deep learning (DL)-based end-to-end workflow for GBM overall survival (OS) prediction using pre-resection basic structural multiparametric magnetic resonance images (Bas-mpMRI) with a multi-institutional public dataset and evaluated it with an independent dataset of patients on a prospective institutional clinical trial. The proposed end-to-end workflow includes a skull-stripping model, a GBM sub-region segmentation model and an ensemble learning-based OS prediction model. The segmentation model utilizes skull-stripped Bas-mpMRIs to segment three GBM sub-regions. The segmented GBM is fed into the contrastive learning-based OS prediction model to classify the patients into different survival groups. Our datasets include both a multi-institutional public dataset from Medical Image Computing and Computer Assisted Intervention (MICCAI) Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) challenge 2020 with 235 patients, and an institutional dataset from a 5-fraction SRS clinical trial with 19 GBM patients. Each data entry consists of pre-operative Bas-mpMRIs, survival days and patient ages. Basic clinical characteristics are also available for SRS clinical trial data. The multi-institutional public dataset was used for workflow establishing (90% of data) and initial validation (10% of data). The validated workflow was then evaluated on the institutional clinical trial data. Our proposed OS prediction workflow achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.86 on the public dataset and 0.72 on the institutional clinical trial dataset to classify patients into 2 OS classes as long-survivors (>12 months) and short-survivors (<12 months), despite the large variation in Bas-mpMRI protocols. In addition, as part of the intermediate results, the proposed workflow can also provide detailed GBM sub-regions auto-segmentation with a whole tumor Dice score of 0.91. Our study demonstrates the feasibility of employing this DL-based end-to-end workflow to predict the OS of patients with GBM using only the pre-resection Bas-mpMRIs.

This study aimed to profile social detachment among older people in Taiwan using the SDQO and explore its use in distinguishing groups with varying levels of social engagement. A telephone-based survey was conducted, collecting demographic data and responses to the SDQO and Brief Symptom Rating Scale-5 (BSRS-5). Cluster analysis based on SDQO dimension scores was performed to identify groupings. Regression analyses examined the association between social engagement clusters, demographic variables, and BSRS-5 scores. A receiver operating characteristic curve was established and the area under the curve was calculated to identify the cutoff for distinguishing individuals with high and low social engagement. In a representative sample of 2549 individuals aged 55 and above in Taiwan, cluster analysis identified two groups based on social engagement levels as measured by the SDQO. The low social engagement cluster, indicating higher social detachment, was more likely to consist of older individuals (≥ 75 years), those without children, and those with lower education levels (≤ 9 years). After adjusting for demographics, the low social engagement cluster was associated with higher BSRS-5 scores. The optimal SDQO cutoff for identifying low social engagement was 27/28. The SDQO can identify socially detached older people, who are more likely to experience increased psychological distress. Screening older individuals with demographic risk factors using the SDQO could help identify those most vulnerable to adverse health outcomes related to social detachment.","2024","International journal of geriatric psychiatry"

However, there are few reports on exosom-based markers for predicting the progression and adjuvant therapy response rate among patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC). The signatures differentially expressed in exosomes from tumor and normal tissues from ccRCC patients were correspondingly deregulated in ccRCC tissues. We adopted a two-step strategy, including Lasso and bootstrapping, to construct a novel risk stratification system termed the TDERS (Tumor-Derived Exosome-Related Risk Score). During the testing and validation phases, we leveraged multiple external datasets containing over 2000 RCC cases from eight cohorts and one inhouse cohort to evaluate the accuracy of the TDERS. In addition, enrichment analysis, immune infiltration signatures, mutation landscape and therapy sensitivity between the high and low TDERS groups were compared. Finally, the impact of TDERS on the tumor microenvironment (TME) was also analysed in our single-cell datasets. TDERS consisted of 12 mRNAs deregulated in both exosomes and tissues from patients with ccRCC. TDERS achieved satisfactory performance in both prognosis and immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) response across all ccRCC cohorts and other pathological types, since the average area under the curve (AUC) to predict 5-year overall survival (OS) was larger than 0.8 across the four cohorts. Patients in the TDERS high group were resistant to ICIs, while mercaptopurine might function as a promising agent for those patients. Patients with a high TDERS were characterized by coagulation and hypoxia, which induced hampered tumor antigen presentation and relative resistance to ICIs. In addition, single cells from 12 advanced samples validated this phenomenon since the interaction between dendritic cells and macrophages was limited. Finally, PLOD2, which is highly expressed in fibro- and epi‑tissue, could be a potential therapeutic target for ccRCC patients since inhibiting PLOD2 altered the malignant phenotype of ccRCC in vitro. As a novel, non-invasive, and repeatable monitoring tool, the TDERS could work as a robust risk stratification system for patients with ccRCC and precisely inform treatment decisions about ICI therapy.","2024","Journal of the National Cancer Center"

All revision surgeries for knee and hip arthroplasty between 2017 and 2020 were included. With regard to microbiological diagnostic, conventional culture of periprosthetic biopsies and sonication of explant material were performed. In addition, histology and non-specific inflammatory markers (CRP, leukocytes) were recorded. A total of 78 patients with PJI and 62 aseptic controls were included. From both microbiological methods (conventional culture / sonication), Staphyloccus (S.) epidermidis and S. aureus were detected most frequently. However, compared to the conventional microbiology, a higher sensitivity was calculated for sonication, albeit with a lower specificity in relation to a PJI. In two logistic regression models for the significance of all diagnostic parameters in PJI, the AUC was 0.92 and 0.96 with histology in particular making the decisive contribution in both models (p < 0. 001, both models). Since histology showed the highest accuracy in the current study, its importance in the PJI criteria should be reevaluated.

The major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (MACCEs), and anastomotic restenosis, both of which are critical factors leading to poor prognosis of ICAS patients after EC-IC bypass, were mainly recorded and analyzed. Kaplan-Meier survival curve and Log-rank tests were sequentially conducted. Cox regression model was used to investigate the association between the TyG index and MACCEs & anastomotic stenosis. C-statistics, continuous net reclassification improvement (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) evaluated the incremental predictive value of the TyG index. A higher incidence of MACCEs and anastomotic stenosis was found in higher-tertile TyG index group. The TyG index was significantly associated with an increased risk of MACCEs and anastomotic stenosis, independent of confounding factors, with a value of HR (1.30, 95%CI 1.10-1.51, p < 0.001) and (1.27, 95%CI 1.16-1.40, p < 0.001) respectively.

The radiomics score (Radscore) was calculated using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression, combined with selected clinical predictors, to develop a nomogram and four machine learning (ML) models: logistic regression, random forest, support vector machine, and extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost). Discrimination, calibration and clinical usefulness of the nomogram and ML models were assessed. The nomogram and ML models were integrated with Radscore and clinical predictors. The nomogram demonstrated favorable discriminatory ability in the training set with an AUC of 0.80, which was confirmed in the validation set (AUC=0.76). Among the ML models, the XGBoost model achieved the highest AUC (training set=0.89 and validation set=0.85), surpassing that of the nomogram. The XGBoost model exhibited good clinical usefulness. Both the nomogram and ML models constructed by non-contrast head CT image-based Radscore integrated with clinical predictors can predict early hematoma expansion of hypertensive intracerebral hemorrhage, and the XGBoost model had the highest prediction performance and best clinical usefulness.","2024","Academic radiology"

Later, the authors updated the PIV score calculated only in the absence of one or both absolute criteria of nonresectability (mesenteric retraction and miliary carcinomatosis of the small bowel) (updated PIV model). The aim was to demonstrate the noninferiority of ultrasound to other imaging methods (contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT) and whole-body diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (WB-DWI)/MRI) in predicting nonresectable tumor (defined as residual disease >1 cm) using the updated PIV model in patients with tubo-ovarian cancer. The agreement between imaging and intraoperative findings as a reference was also calculated. This was a European prospective multicenter observational study. We included patients with suspected tubo-ovarian carcinoma who underwent preoperative staging and prediction of nonresectability at ultrasound, CT, WB-DWI/MRI, and surgical exploration. Ultrasound and CT were mandatory index tests, while WB-DWI/MRI was an optional test (non-available in all centers). The predictors of nonresectability were suspicious mesenteric retraction and/or miliary carcinomatosis of the small bowel or if absent, a PIV >8 (updated PIV model). The PIV score ranges from 0 to 12 according to the presence of disease in 6 predefined intra-abdominal sites (great omentum, liver surface, lesser omentum/stomach/spleen, parietal peritoneum, diaphragms, bowel serosa/mesentery). The reference standard was surgical outcome, in terms of residual disease >1 cm, assessed by laparoscopy and/or laparotomy. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to assess the performance of the methods in predicting nonresectability was reported. Concordance between index tests at the detection of disease at 6 predefined sites and intraoperative exploration as reference standard was also calculated using Cohen's kappa. The study was between 2018 and 2022 in 5 European gynecological oncology centers. Data from 242 patients having both mandatory index tests (ultrasound and CT) were analyzed. 145/242 (59.9%) patients had no macroscopic residual tumor after surgery (R0) (5/145 laparoscopy and 140/145 laparotomy) and 17/242 (7.0%) had residual tumor ≤1 cm (R1) (laparotomy). In 80/242 patients (33.1%), the residual tumor was>1 cm (R2), 30 of them underwent laparotomy and maximum surgery was carried out, and 50/80 underwent laparoscopy only, because cytoreduction was not feasible in all of them. After excluding 18/242 (7.4%) patients operated on but not eligible for extensive surgery, the predictive performance of 3 imaging methods was analyzed in 167 women. The AUCs of all methods in discriminating between resectable and nonresectable tumor was 0.80 for ultrasound, 0.76 for CT, 0.71 for WB-DWI/MRI, and 0.90 for surgical exploration. Ultrasound had the highest agreement (Cohen's kappa ranging from 0.59 to 0.79) than CT and WB-DWI/MRI to assess all parameters included in the updated PIV model. Ultrasound showed noninferiority to CT and to WB-DWI/MRI in discriminating between resectable and nonresectable tumor using the updated PIV model. Ultrasound had the best agreement between imaging and intraoperative findings in the assessment of parameters included in the updated PIV model. Ultrasound is an acceptable method to assess abdominal disease and predict nonresectability in patients with tubo-ovarian cancer in the hands of specially trained ultrasound examiners.","2024","American journal of obstetrics and gynecology"

Its diagnosis is challenging, relying on clinical symptoms and invasive procedures. Delays can cause severe physical disability, including hand, foot, and eye impairments. Herein, we describe the development of a magneto-immunoassay based on an electrochemical disposable microfluidic device for the serological diagnosis of leprosy. The assay makes use of magnetic particles (MPs) modified with Mycobacterium leprae mimotope as a probe to capture and separate target-specific antibodies from serum samples. The antibody anti-M. leprae was detected using the anti-human antibody IgG conjugated with horseradish peroxidase enzyme as an electrochemical maker. The magneto-immunoassay was applied in serum samples from healthy subjects and patients diagnosed with leprosy classified as paucibacillary (PB) and multibacillary (MB). The results showed that the method could differentiate between negative and positive patients (AUC = 0.990) with high clinical sensitivity (91.2%) and specificity (100.0%). In addition, the assay showed the capability to differentiate between paucibacillary and multibacillary with sensitivities of 88.9% and 93.7%, respectively, indicating that the device can be used to guide the treatment of positive cases. Thus, magneto-immunoassay based on the use of a disposable microfluidic device demonstrated to be a valuable tool for the early diagnosis of leprosy which can help the public health system to reduce disability cases and even control and eliminate the disease by interrupting the chain of transmission.","2025","Biosensors & bioelectronics"

Clinical parameters and genomic data were extracted from 310 HGG patients in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database and 27 patients in the Repository of Molecular Brain Neoplasia Data (REMBRANDT) database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression, as well as Kaplan-Meier analysis, were performed for prognosis analysis. The correlation between immune cell Infiltration with CDK6 was assessed using spearman correlation analysis. Radiomic features were extracted from contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (CE-MRI) in the Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA) database (n = 82) and REMBRANDT database (n = 27). Logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) were employed to establish the radiomics model for predicting CDK6 expression. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were utilized to assess the predictive performance of the radiomics model. Generate radiomic scores (RS) based on the LR model. An RS-based nomogram was constructed to predict the prognosis of HGG. CDK6 was significantly overexpressed in HGG tissues and was related to lower overall survival. A significant elevation in infiltrating M0 macrophages was observed in the CDK6 high group (P < 0.001). The LR radiomics model for the prediction of CDK6 expression levels (AUC=0.810 in the training cohort, AUC = 0.784 after cross-validation, AUC=0.750 in the testing cohort) was established utilizing three radiomic features. The predictive efficiencies of the RS-based nomogram, as measured by AUC, were 0.769 for 1-year, 0.815 for 3-year, and 0.780 for 5-year, respectively. The expression level of CDK6 can impact the prognosis of patients with HGG. The expression level of HGG can be noninvasively prognosticated utilizing a radiomics model.","2024","Academic radiology"

873,"39647641","Cardiac Elastography With External Vibration for Quantification of Diastolic Myocardial Stiffness.","Heart failure is an increasing global health problem. Approximately 50% of patients with heart failure have heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) and concomitant diastolic dysfunction (DD), in part caused by increased myocardial stiffness not detectable by standard echocardiography. While elastography can map tissue stiffness, cardiac applications are currently limited, especially in patients with a higher body mass index. Therefore, we developed cardiac time-harmonic elastography (THE) to detect abnormal diastolic myocardial stiffness associated with DD. Cardiac THE was developed using standard medical ultrasound and continuous external vibration for regionally resolved mapping of diastolic shear wave speed as a proxy for myocardial stiffness. The method was prospectively applied to 54 healthy controls (26 women), 10 patients with moderate left ventricular hypertrophy (mLVH; 5 women), and 45 patients with wild-type transthyretin amyloidosis (wTTR; 4 women), 20 of whom were treated with tafamidis. Ten healthy participants were reinvestigated after 2 to 6 months to analyze test-retest reproducibility by intraclass correlation coefficients. Myocardial shear wave speed was measured with good reproducibility (intraclass correlation coefficient = 0.82) and showed higher values in wTTR (3.0 ± 0.7 m/sec) than in mLVH (2.1 ± 0.6 m/sec) and healthy controls (1.8 ± 0.3 m/sec, all P < .05). Area under the curve values were 0.991 and 0.737 for discriminating wTTR and mLVH from healthy controls, respectively. Shear wave speed was reduced in patients after tafamidis treatment (2.6 ± 0.6 m/sec, P = .04), suggesting the potential value of THE for therapy monitoring. Shear wave speed was quantified in the septum, posterior wall, and an automatically masked region (here stated for the septal region). Cardiac THE detects abnormal myocardial stiffness in patients with DD with high penetration depth, independent of body mass index and region selection. Based on standard ultrasound components, cardiac THE is cost-effective and has the potential to become a point-of-care method for stiffness-sensitive echocardiography.","2024","Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography"

The results showed that the probe (participants' name) elicited a more negative N200, and a more positive recognition P300 than irrelevants among guilty participants. Additionally, feedback following the probe elicited a larger feedback P300 than feedback following irrelevants. Further, we found that three indicators, including the conflict-monitoring N200, recognition P300, and feedback P300, could significantly discriminate between guilty and innocent participants, whereas the FRN could not. Combining them is highly effective in discriminating between guilty and innocent participants (AUC = 0.91).

Multivariable logistic regression with backward stepwise selection was used to develop the models. Discrimination was assessed using the ROC curve C-statistic, and internal validation was assessed using bootstrapping techniques. We conducted temporal external validation using data from all singleton deliveries at CUMH during 2020. Out of 6,077 women, 5,809 (95.6%) with complete data were included in the analyses. A total of 612 infants (10.54%) were admitted to the neonatal care unit for > 24 hours.

This multicentre, prospective, double-blind study was conducted across four German urological centres from 2019 to 2024. We evaluated the diagnostic performance of Uromonitor compared to urine cytology in a cohort of patients with UCB and in healthy controls within a real-world setting. Sensitivity, specificity, positive-predictive value (PPV), negative-predictive value (NPV), and accuracy of the tests were measured, in addition to multivariate analyses to assess the ability of individual proto-oncogene mutations in detecting UCB. The biometric sample size was designed to achieve a 10% difference in sensitivity. Patients with UCB comprised 63.7% (339/532) of the study group. Uromonitor showed a sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, accuracy, and an area-under-the-curve of 49.3%, 93.3%, 92.8%, 51.1%, 65.2%, and 0.713%, respectively. These metrics did not demonstrate statistical superiority over urine cytology in terms of sensitivity (44.6%; P = 0.316). Moreover, the comparison of additional test parameters, as well as the comparison within various sensitivity analyses, yielded no significant disparity between the two urinary tests. Multivariate logistic regression underscored the significant predictive value of a positive Uromonitor for detecting UCB (odds ratio [OR] 9.03; P < 0.001). Furthermore, mutations in TERT and FGFR-3 were independently associated with high odds of UCB detection (OR 13.30 and 7.04, respectively), while KRAS mutations did not exhibit predictive capability. Despite its innovative approach, Uromonitor fell short of confirming the superior results anticipated from previous studies in this real-world setting. The search for an optimal urine-based biomarker for detecting and monitoring UCB remains ongoing.

The aim of this study was to investigate the use of respiratory signal analysis to assess severity of BOAS in dogs. Hundred and seventeen client-owned dogs of brachycephalic and non-brachycephalic breeds were enrolled. Respiratory sounds were recorded using an electronic stethoscope before and after a 3-minute exercise test (ET). Dogs were assigned a BOAS severity grade (BOAS 0-3) using a validated respiratory functional grading scheme. Signal analysis techniques were used to identify seven sound variables. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to investigate associations between variables and BOAS severity and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to assess the diagnostic efficacy of each sound variable. For each sound variable, there was a significant association with BOAS grade. An increase in BOAS grade resulted in greater sound magnitude in the frequency spectrum (0-1000 Hz), and in a greater contribution of lower frequencies (170-260 Hz). The variable ""Peak 1"" had the best performance in predicting BOAS negative (BOAS 0 +1) versus BOAS positive dogs (BOAS 2 + 3) before the ET; area under the curve (AUC) = 76.6 % (95 % confidence interval 67.4-85.8 %), whereas the variable ""Valley 1"" had the highest predictive value after the ET; AUC = 87.8 % (95 % confidence interval 81.4-94.3 %).

Between 2014 and 2020, a retrospective observational cohort study of hospital admissions cases aged <18 years with injury-related ICD-10 codes, using the German hospital database (GHD), was conducted. The maximum abbreviated injury scale and ISS were calculated using the International Classification of Diseases-Abbreviated Injury Scale (ICD-AIS) map provided by the Association for the Advancement of Automotive Medicine, adjusted to the German modification of the ICD-10 classification. The survival risk ratio was used to calculate the single-worst ICD-derived injury (single International Classification of Disease Injury Severity Score [ICISS]) and a multiplicative ICISS. Logistic regressions were conducted for each of the four above-mentioned scores (predictors) to predict in-hospital mortality (outcome) in the selected trauma population and within four clinically relevant subgroups using discrimination and calibration. 1,720,802 were trauma patients, and ICD-AIS mapping was possible in 1,328,377 cases. Cases with mapping failure (n = 392,425; 22.8%) were younger and had a higher mortality rate were excluded from the performance analysis. ICISS-derived scores had a better discrimination and calibration than ICD-AIS based scores in the overall cohort and all four subgroups (area under the curve [AUC] ranges between 0.985 and 0.998 vs 0.886 and- 0.972, respectively). Empirically derived measures of injury severity were superior to ICD-AIS mapped scores in the GHD to predict mortality in pediatric trauma patients. Given the high percentage of mapping failure and high mortality among cases with single-coded injury, the single ICISS may be the most suitable measure of injury severity in this group of patients.","2025","Journal of clinical epidemiology"

Physician-diagnosed current asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) via methacholine challenge tests were evaluated at age seven. We estimated PM exposure with a diameter <10 μm (PM10) during pregnancy using land-use regression models. We performed genome-wide methylation profiling in the placenta of 40 samples in the COCOA study and analyzed the gene expression levels. High PM10 exposure during pregnancy increased the risk of developing current asthma and BHR in the COCOA study (aOR 2.36, 95% CI 1.06-5.22; aOR 2.14, 95% CI 1.40-3.27, respectively) and current asthma in the PSKC (aOR 2.62, 95% CI 1.35-5.09).

The methylation and expression levels of eight genes (PAX6, REST, OLIG2, GLI1, ZBTB7A, NOTCH4, NOTCH1, and NOTCH3) in these pathways correlated with clinical parameters. This may effectively predict PM-related asthma through a prediction model using degrees of gene-based or CpG-based methylation (AUC = 0.96 and 0.93, respectively).

Methods: Supervised automated machine learning in the Auto-Classifier model of the IBM SPSS Modeler package was used to predict microvascular complications in a training data set of 348 long-term T2D patients with complications using 24 independent variables as predictors and complications as targets. Three automated model scenarios were tested: Full All-Variable Model; Univariate-Selected Model, and Backward Stepwise Logistic Regression Model. An independent cohort of 338 newly diagnosed T2D patients with no complications was used for the model validation. Results: Long-term T2D patients with complications (duration = ~14.5 years) were significantly older (mean age = 56.3 ± 10.9 years) than the newly diagnosed patients without complications (duration = ~2.5 years; mean age = 48.9 ± 9.6 years). The Bayesian Network was the most reliable algorithm for predicting microvascular complications in all three scenarios with an area under the curve (AUC) of 77-87%, accuracy of 68-75%, sensitivity of 86-95%, and specificity of 53-75%. Among newly diagnosed T2D patients, 22.5% were predicted positive and 49.1% negative across all models. Logistic regression applied to the 16 significant predictors between the two sub-groups showed that BMI, HDL, adjusted for age at diagnosis of T2D, age at visit, and urine albumin explained >90% of the variation in microvascular measures.

This study utilized questionnaire data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) collected in 2011, 2013, and 2015. A latent class growth model (LCGM) was established using CLDs as the baseline sample. This model stratified the patients based on the extent of the decline in Δpeak expiratory flow (ΔPEF), which served as the target variable. Independent variables included age, gender, smoking status, body mass index, education level, and comorbidities. A random forest model was developed using Python, and the importance of the feature was visualized through the SHAP method. The predictive performance of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, calibration curve analysis, and decision curve analysis. After screening, a total of 553 patients with CLDs were included in the study. The random forest model pinpointed grip strength, age, education level, gender, and asthma as the top five risk factors for pulmonary function decline.

A multimodal identity perception method based on deep learning.","Post-discharge follow-up stands as a critical component of post-diagnosis management, and the constraints of healthcare resources impede comprehensive manual follow-up. However, patients are less cooperative with AI follow-up calls or may even hang up once AI voice robots are perceived. To improve the effectiveness of follow-up, alternative measures should be taken when patients perceive AI voice robots. Therefore, identifying how patients perceive AI voice robots is crucial. This study aims to construct a multimodal identity perception model based on deep learning to identify how patients perceive AI voice robots. Our dataset includes 2030 response audio recordings and corresponding texts from patients. We conduct comparative experiments and perform an ablation study. The proposed model employs a transfer learning approach, utilizing BERT and TextCNN for text feature extraction, AST and LSTM for audio feature extraction, and self-attention for feature fusion. Our model demonstrates superior performance against existing baselines, with a precision of 86.67%, an AUC of 84%, and an accuracy of 94.38%. Additionally, a generalization experiment was conducted using 144 patients' response audio recordings and corresponding text data from other departments in the hospital, confirming the model's robustness and effectiveness. Our multimodal identity perception model can identify how patients perceive AI voice robots effectively. Identifying how patients perceive AI not only helps to optimize the follow-up process and improve patient cooperation, but also provides support for the evaluation and optimization of AI voice robots.","2024","Journal of biomedical informatics"

In adults presenting at the ED with UTI suspicion, biomarker performance was compared with that of routine diagnostics (urine dipstick, automated urinalysis). Patients with a urine catheter, leukopenia, or neither (standard) were analyzed separately. A UTI was clinically diagnosed in 91 of 196 episodes (46.4%) (standard: 29/67 [43.2%]; catheter: 46/73 [63.0%]; leukopenia: 17/60 [28.3%]; four patients had both). Procalcitonin did not discriminate between UTI and no UTI. Urinary biomarker levels were elevated in UTI episodes (median, µg/mmol creatinine: NGAL, 7.8 vs 46.3; IL-8, 6.1 vs 76.6; calprotectin, 23.9 vs 265.4); the three subgroups also had higher levels. Biomarker cut-off values (90% sensitivity) showed low specificity (range 20.8-64.9%) and moderate accuracy (58.6-75.4%). The biomarkers performed similarly to routine diagnostics, except for patients with leukopenia, who exhibited nonsignificantly higher area under the curve values. All urinary biomarkers correlated positively with urine leukocyte count. Plasma procalcitonin could not accurately diagnose UTI. Urine IL-8, NGAL, and calprotectin showed no additional value relative to routine diagnostics, except a minor improvement in patients with leukopenia. These urine biomarkers seem to predominantly reflect leukocyturia.","2024","International journal of infectious diseases : IJID : official publication of the International Society for Infectious Diseases"

We considered OA as a non-inflammatory comparator. We utilized primary care records from the Clinical Practice Research Datalink (CPRD) Aurum database to identify individuals with each condition and calculated 10-year cardiovascular risk using each prediction tool. The discrimination and calibration of each tool was assessed for each disease. The time-dependent area under the curve (AUC) for QRISK3 was 0.752 for RA (95% CI 0.734-0.777), 0.794 for AS (95% CI 0.764-0.812), 0.764 for PsA (95% CI 0.741-0.791), 0.815 for psoriasis (95% CI 0.789-0.835) and 0.698 for OA (95% CI 0.670-0.717), indicating reasonably good predictive performance. The AUCs for the FRS were similar, and slightly lower for the RRS. The FRS was reasonably well calibrated for each condition but underpredicted risk for patients with RA. The RRS tended to underpredict CVD risk, while QRISK3 overpredicted CVD risk, especially for the most high-risk individuals. CVD risk for individuals with RA, AS and psoriatic disease was generally less accurately predicted using each of the three CVD risk prediction tools than the reported accuracies in the original publications. Individuals with OA also had less accurate predictions, suggesting inflammation is not the sole reason for underperformance.

Relevant studies identified from Medline via PubMed, Scopus, Embase, and Cochrane Library databases were retrieved to answer the following PECO question: ""In systemically healthy individuals, are there any differences in salivary protein expression profiles assessed in proteomics studies between patients with periodontitis and periodontally healthy or gingivitis subjects?"" Moreover, diagnostic utility of the identified markers was sought via a targeted literature search and further quantitative assessment.

The number of identified discriminant salivary proteins ranged from 2 to 4161. However, it was possible to identify proteins that were consistently over- or under-expressed in periodontitis patients in at least 3 studies. Among these, complement C3, profilin-1, SA100A8, and fibrinogen were consistently reported as increased in periodontitis, while cystatin-SN and leukocyte elastase inhibitor were more elevated in periodontally healthy controls. Only 4 studies reported diagnostic accuracy measures, with SA100A8 showing an area under the curve of 0.71 (95% CI: 0.66-0.75) in meta-analysis. Untargeted proteomics techniques identified some key biological molecules which were consistently reported to be over- or under-expressed in periodontitis.

We retrospectively reviewed 27 patients with fp-AML and 63 with hm-ccRCC. Demographic data and conventional CT features of the lesions were recorded (including sex, age, symptoms, lesion location, shape, boundary, unenhanced CT attenuation and so on). Whole tumor regions of interest were drawn on all slices to obtain histogram parameters (including minimum, maximum, mean, percentile, standard deviation, variance, coefficient of variation, skewness, kurtosis, and entropy) by two radiologists. Chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U test, or independent samples t-test were used to compare demographic data, CT features, and histogram parameters. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to screen for independent predictors distinguishing fp-AML from hm-ccRCC. Receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed to evaluate the diagnostic performances of the models. Age, sex, tumor boundary, unenhanced CT attenuation, maximum tumor diameter, and tumor volume significantly differed between patients with fp-AML and those with hm-ccRCC (P < 0.05). The minimum, mean, first percentile (Perc.01), Perc.05, Perc.10, Perc.25, Perc.50, Perc.75, Perc.90, Perc.95, and Perc.99 of the Fp-AML group were higher than those of the hm-ccRCC group (P < 0.05).

DECT of 813 patient blood samples from 465 women and 348 men was conducted using a standardized scan protocol. Electron density relative to water (ρ or rho), effective atomic number (Zeff), and CT attenuation (Hounsfield unit) were measured. Positive correlation with the Hb/Hct was shown for ρ (r-values 0.37-0.49) and attenuation (r-values 0.59-0.83) while no correlation was observed for Zeff (r-values -0.04 to 0.08). Significant differences in attenuation and ρ values were detected for blood samples with and without anemia in both genders (p value < 0.001) with area under the curve ranging from 0.7 to 0.95. Depending on the respective CT parameters, various cutoff values for CT-based anemia detection could be determined. In summary, our study investigated the correlation between DECT measurements and Hb/Hct levels, emphasizing novel aspects of ρ and Zeff values. Assuming that quantitative changes in the number of hemoglobin proteins might alter the mean Zeff values, the results of our study show that there is no measurable correlation on the atomic level using DECT. We established a positive in vitro correlation between Hb/Hct values and ρ. Nevertheless, attenuation emerged as the most strongly correlated parameter with identifiable cutoff values, highlighting its preference for CT-based anemia detection. By scanning multiple blood samples with dual-energy CT scans and comparing the measurements with standard laboratory blood tests, we were able to underscore the potential of CT-based anemia detection and its advantages in clinical practice. Prior in vivo studies have found a correlation between aortic blood pool and measured hemoglobin and hematocrit. Hemoglobin and hematocrit correlated with electron density relative to water and attenuation but not Zeff. Dual-energy CT has the potential for additional clinical benefits, such as CT-based anemia detection.","2024","European radiology"

This complication is characterized by the formation of ulcers that are difficult to heal on the skin of the foot. Ulcers can negatively affect patients' quality of life, and improperly treated lesions can result in amputation and even death. Traditionally, the severity and type of foot ulcers are determined by doctors through visual observations and on the basis of their clinical experience; however, this subjective evaluation can lead to misjudgments. In addition, quantitative methods have been developed for classifying and scoring are therefore time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we propose a reconstruction residual network with a fused spatial-channel attention mechanism (FARRNet) for automatically classifying DFUs. The use of pseudo-labeling and Data augmentation as a pre-processing technique can overcome problems caused by data imbalance and small sample size. The developed model's attention was enhanced using a spatial channel attention (SPCA) module that incorporates spatial and channel attention mechanisms. A reconstruction mechanism was incorporated into the developed residual network to improve its feature extraction ability for achieving better classification. The performance of the proposed model was compared with that of state-of-the-art models and those in the DFUC Grand Challenge. When applied to the DFUC Grand Challenge, the proposed method outperforms other state-of-the-art schemes in terms of accuracy, as evaluated using 5-fold cross-validation and the following metrics: macro-average F1-score, AUC, Recall, and Precision. FARRNet achieved the F1-score of 60.81%, AUC of 87.37%, Recall of 61.04%, and Precision of 61.56%. Therefore, the proposed model is more suitable for use in medical diagnosis environments with embedded devices and limited computing resources.

In the prevalent Siamese-based paradigm, the features extracted by the Siamese-like networks are often insufficient to model the tracked targets and distractor objects, thereby hindering them from being robust and discriminative simultaneously. While most Siamese trackers focus on designing robust correlation operations, we propose a novel single-branch tracking framework inspired by the transformer. Unlike the Siamese-like feature extraction, our tracker deeply embeds cross-image feature correlation in multiple layers of the feature network. By extensively matching the features of the two images through multiple layers, it can suppress non-target features, resulting in target-aware feature extraction. The output features can be directly used to predict target locations without additional correlation steps. Thus, we reformulate the two-branch Siamese tracking as a conceptually simple, fully transformer-based Single-Branch Tracking pipeline, dubbed SBT. After conducting an in-depth analysis of the SBT baseline, we summarize many effective design principles and propose an improved tracker dubbed SuperSBT. SuperSBT adopts a hierarchical architecture with a local modeling layer to enhance shallow-level features. A unified relation modeling is proposed to remove complex handcrafted layer pattern designs. SuperSBT is further improved by masked image modeling pre-training, integrating temporal modeling, and equipping with dedicated prediction heads. Thus, SuperSBT outperforms the SBT baseline by 4.7%,3.0%, and 4.5% AUC scores in LaSOT, TrackingNet, and GOT-10K. Notably, SuperSBT greatly raises the speed of SBT from 37 FPS to 81 FPS.

We studied 171 patients with chronic HF with worsening congestion symptoms and inadequate response to standard therapies, requiring intravenous diuretic treatment. The primary outcome was a composite of all-cause mortality or HF hospitalization. We assessed the association and the incremental value of GS, as compared to other clinical confounders, with the primary outcome. The mean age was 76±11 years, 66 % were male, median BNP was 481 pg/ml, and median ejection fraction was 40 %. Over a median follow-up of 11.3 months, 71 events occurred. Lower GS was significantly associated with a higher risk of events (HR of 4.03, 95 % CI 2.25-7.21), along with neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio, BNP, QRS duration, natremia, and previous myocardial infarction. When added to the MAGGIC risk score and the other significant confounders identified, GS significantly enhanced the model risk prediction (Harrell's C-index 0.75 vs 0.71, p < 0.001).

Yet, the connection between SMD and intra-abdominal infection in individuals who have suffered abdominal injuries is still unclear. The purpose of this research is to examine how well SMD can predict intra-abdominal infection in patients who have suffered abdominal trauma. Participants with abdominal injuries were included in this research from January 2015 to April 2023. Based on the sex-specific cut off values of SMD, the entire population was split into two categories. Prognostic factors were identified through logistic regression analysis. ROC was used to assess the predictive accuracy of SMD and its combinations with other biomarkers for clinical outcomes. A total of 220 patients were ultimately included in the study. Patients in the group with low SMD exhibited a higher incidence of intra-abdominal infection, longer hospital stays, and increased hospital costs. In patients with abdominal trauma, low SMD was identified as a significant independent predictor of intra-abdominal infection (OR 2.397; 95 % CI 1.117-5.141, p = 0.025). Low SMD had a higher area under the curve (AUC) in ROC analysis compared to TRF, NRS2002 score, and APACHEII score for predicting intra-abdominal infection (AUC 0.70, 95 % CI 0.61-0.78, p = 0.002). Moreover, low SMD showed associations with clinical outcomes such as hospital stay length and costs (p < 0.01).

Adult (≥18 years) medical OHCA patients attended by EAAA between 01/02/2015 and 01/02/2024, who had arterial IBP measurement during chest compressions were included. The initial, minimum, maximum, average (mean) and Δ (maximum-initial) were calculated for systolic (SBP), diastolic (DBP) and mean arterial (MAP) components of IBP. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curves tested the association between IBP variables and ROSC. During the study period, 4363 OHCA patients were attended and 80 met inclusion criteria. Thirty-four patients (42.5 %) achieved ROSC and 4 (5.0 %) survived to discharge. The maximum, average and Δ DBP; and maximum and average MAP were positively associated with ROSC. Maximum DBP had an AUC of 0.83 (95 % CI 0.74-0.92) with an optimal cut-off of 35 mmHg (sensitivity 94.1 %; specificity 58.7 %) for predicting ROSC. The odds ratio for ROSC was 1.05 (95 % CI 1.03-1.08) for every 1 mmHg increase in maximum DBP. This study supports the use of arterial DBP as an important haemodynamic parameter for goal-directed resuscitation in adult OHCA. Maximising DBP may increase the chances of ROSC. These data suggest that a DBP threshold of 35 mmHg is optimal for identifying patients who may achieve ROSC with continued resuscitation.","2024","Resuscitation"

Performance was evaluated on the remaining 30% using area under the ROC curve (AUC) and Cohen's Kappa (κ). Two alternative JEM were proposed using only job titles or adding healthcare establishment size and type (public/private) to define occupational groups. All methods offered similar discriminatory power (AUC). We selected the group-based frequency method as it was the most understandable and easiest to implement. Of the 24 included exposures, 15 demonstrated satisfactory performance, with nine showing good discriminatory power and fair-to-moderate agreement, such as physical effort at work (AUC=0.861, κ=0.556), ionizing radiation exposure (AUC=0.865, κ=0.457), carrying heavy loads (AUC=0.840, κ=0.402), shift work (AUC=0.807, κ=0.383), and formaldehyde exposure (AUC=0.847, κ=0.289). The remaining nine exposures mainly showed poor-to-moderate discriminatory power and poor agreement. Compared to JEM Soignances, the job title-only JEM performed poorly, while the one incorporating healthcare establishment size and type showed similar results. JEM Soignances provides good internal performance and validity.

The advanced neoplasias showed 95 % specificity for worrisome gene mutations, with the highest diagnostic accuracy observed for NGS mutations, achieving an AUC of 0.777 in the ROC curve analysis compared to 0.631 for CEA. Patients with worrisome gene mutations were offered surgical treatment. NGS results contributed to the decision to operate in 11 out of 23 cases. In 71 % of all cases, NGS supported the diagnosis, with 3 % false positives and 12 % false negatives. NGS analysis of pancreatic cyst fluid demonstrates high specificity and may serve as an additional diagnostic tool to CEA. Combining cystic fluid CEA and NGS increases the accuracy in determining whether a lesion is mucinous and NGS showed a higher diagnostic accuracy in advanced lesions compared to CEA. While the absence of alarming NGS findings should not preclude surgical treatment, patients with alarming mutations should be considered for surgery.","2024","Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

This study evaluated the diagnostic potential of a broad range of biomarkers of tissue damage and inflammation in unstimulated plasma in children. We analyzed 17 biomarkers in 15 non-M. tuberculosis (MTB)-infected controls and 33 children with TB infection (LTBI, n = 8; probable TB, n = 19; confirmed TB, n = 6). Biomarker concentrations were measured using a Luminex magnetic bead-based platform and multiplex sandwich immunoassays. Concentrations, correlations and diagnostic accuracy assessments were conducted among patient groups. Confirmed TB cases had significantly higher concentrations of IFN-γ and IL-2 and higher IFN-γ/MCP-1 and IL-2/MCP-1 ratios compared to LTBI and non-MTB-infected children. Among children with confirmed TB, there was a strong correlation between IFN-γ and IL-10 (r = 0.95; p < 0.001) and a significant correlation between IL-2 and IL-1ra (r = 0.92), IL-21 (r = 0.91), MCP-3 (r = 0.84), and MMP-1 (r = 0.85). The IFN-γ/MCP-1 ratio was the most accurate biomarker combination for differentiating between MTB-infected and non-MTB-infected children (AUC, 0.82; sensitivity, 87.9%; specificity, 66.6%; p < 0.001) and between active TB and non-MTB-infected children (AUC 0.82; sensitivity 88.0%; specificity 60.0%; p < 0.001). None of the biomarkers investigated were able to discriminate between LTBI and active TB. Our data suggest that combining the analyses of multiple biomarkers in plasma has the potential to enhance diagnosis of TB in children and, thus, warrants additional investigation. In particular, the diagnostic potential of IFN-γ/MCP-1 ratios should be further explored in larger pediatric cohorts.","2024","Journal of microbiology, immunology, and infection = Wei mian yu gan ran za zhi"

However, data regarding the in-vivo effect of PEF energy on erythrocytes during AF ablation procedures are scarce. This study aimed to quantify the impact of PEF energy on erythrocyte damage during AF ablation by assessing specific hemolytic biomarkers. A total of 60 patients (age: 68 years, males: 72%, serum creatinine: 91 µmol/L) with AF underwent catheter ablation of AF using PEF energy delivered by a multipolar pentaspline Farawave catheter (Farapulse, Boston Scientific, Inc.). Ablation beyond pulmonary vein isolation was performed at the operator's discretion. Peripheral venous blood was sampled for assessing the plasma levels of free hemoglobin (fHb), direct (conjugated) bilirubin, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and creatinine before, immediately after the ablation, and on the next day. Following the PEF ablation with duration of [median (interquartile range)] 75 (58, 95) min, with 74 (52, 92) applications and PVI only in 27% of patients, fHb, LDH, and direct bilirubin significantly increased, from 40 (18, 65) to 493 (327, 848) mg/L, from 3.1 (2.6, 3.6) to 6.8 (5.0, 7.9) µkat/L, and from 12 (9, 17) to 28 (16, 44) µmol/L, respectively (all p < .0001). A strong linear correlation was found between the peak fHb and the number of PEF applications (R = 0.81, p < .001). The major hemolysis (defined as fHb >500 mg/L) was predicted by the number of PEF applications with the corresponding area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.934. The optimum cut-off value of >74 PEF applications predicted the major hemolysis with 89% sensitivity and 87% specificity. Catheter ablation of AF using PEF energy delivered from a pentaspline catheter is associated with significant intravascular hemolysis. More than 74 PEF applications frequently resulted in major hemolysis. However, the critical amount of PEF energy that may cause kidney injury in susceptible patients remains to be investigated.","2024","Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology"

In our study, as a proof of concept, we developed and internally validated a fracture risk calculator using only information in the EHR. Fracture risk calculators, such as the Fracture Risk Assessment Tool, or FRAX, typically lie outside the clinician workflow. Conversely, the electronic health record (EHR) is at the center of the clinical workflow, and many variables in the EHR could predict fractures without having to verbally ascertain FRAX risk factors. We sought to evaluate the utility of EHR variables to predict fractures and, as a proof of concept, to create an EHR-based fracture risk model. Routine clinical data from 24,189 subjects presenting to primary care from 2010 to 2018 was utilized. Major osteoporotic fractures (MOFs) were captured by physician diagnosis codes. Data was split into training (n = 18,141) and test sets (n = 6048). We fit Cox regression models for candidate risk factors in the training set, and then created a global model using a backward stepwise approach. We then applied the model to the test set and compared the discrimination and calibration to FRAX. We found variables related to vital signs, utilization, diagnoses, medications, and laboratory values to be associated with incident MOF. Our final model included 19 variables, including age, BMI, Parkinson's disease, chronic kidney disease, and albumin levels. When applied to the test set, we found the discrimination (AUC 0.73 vs. 0.70, p = 0.08) and calibration were comparable to FRAX. Routinely collected data in EHR systems can generate adequate fracture predictions without the need to verbally ascertain fracture risk factors. In the future, this could allow for automated fracture prediction at the point of care to improve osteoporosis screening and treatment rates.","2024","Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA"

The objective is to investigate the clinical value of CEUS in differentiating between GM and IDC. We retrospectively enrolled 39 GM patients and 64 IDC patients between January 2020 and June 2023. All diagnoses were confirmed via core needle biopsy or surgical pathology. The characteristics of both conventional US and CEUS in these patients were analysed to distinguish GM from IDC. Based on CEUS features, GM lesions most commonly presented as hypoechoic areas (43.6%), followed by pseudocysts (28.2%), hypoechoic nodules (15.4%), and honeycomb cysts (12.8%). The diffuse enhancement pattern was an independent characteristic for distinguishing GM from IDC, with the ROC analysis revealing an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.794. US is the preferred initial examination for GM, and both its conventional and CEUS features can enhance diagnostic accuracy and guide clinical treatment. CEUS demonstrates high differential diagnostic value in distinguishing GM from IDC. This study categorizes GM manifestations on CEUS into four types, each corresponding to different pathological stages of GM. We identified that the diffuse enhancement pattern on CEUS is a distinctive characteristic associated with GM, aiding in its differentiation from IDC.","2024","The British journal of radiology"

We included sick inborn neonates admitted at a level III neonatal intensive care unit. Neonates with congenital anomalies and who died within 72 h of life were excluded. AKI was defined and categorized as per KDIGO guidelines. Two hundred and seventy-six neonates were enrolled over 1 year, of which 115 (42%) had AKI. The incidence of AKI was highest n = 27/38 (71%) among extremely preterm (< 28 weeks) infants. On Cox regression analysis, sepsis, invasive ventilation, acidosis, and perinatal asphyxia were significantly associated with AKI with a hazard ratio (95% CI) of 4 (1.21-13.42), 2.3 (1.32-4.03), 1.9 (1.13-3.36), and 1.5 (1.04-2.31), respectively. The risk prediction model, using the 4 predictors mentioned above, had good diagnostic accuracy (area under the curve, 83.6%) with a sensitivity and specificity of 77% and 80%, respectively. Infants with AKI have significantly higher mortality, compared to those who did not have AKI n = 45/115 (39%) vs. n = 5/161 (3%), p < 0.01.

Various factors have been implicated as predictors for maturation, including vein diameter and access type. Vein distensibility, which refers to the ability of the vein to dilate in response to changes in blood flow and pressure, has been proposed as a potential predictor for maturation, but its utility remains poorly studied. This is a single-institution retrospective study of AVFs performed under regional anesthesia. Vein distensibility was defined as the absolute and relative difference in target vein diameter (TVD) between the preoperative ultrasound vein mapping performed with tourniquet and a repeat ultrasound examination after a regional block before AVF creation and without a tourniquet. Forty-six patients underwent first-time AVF surgery with distensibility recorded in a prospectively maintained database. The mean initial preoperative TVD was 2.7 mm, and after the block 3.4 mm. The unassisted maturation rate for the entire cohort was 76%. In patients with an absolute change of TVD of <0.5 mm (Δ<0.5), the unassisted maturation rate was 63% (12/19), even though 95% of the group had a preoperative TVD of >3 mm. In those with ≥0.5 mm, the unassisted maturation rate was 85% (23/27; P = .08), even though the preoperative vein map TVD was 2.3 mm and 75% had a vein map TVD of <3 mm. For radiocephalic AVFs (n = 26), the unassisted maturation rate was 75% for Δ<0.5 vs 94% for Δ≥0.5 (P = .16), despite a preoperative vein map TVD of >3 mm in 92% vs 75%, respectively. The receiver operatring characteristic area under the curve for unassisted maturation with a Δ≥0.5 mm was 0.68 (P = .26). Quality in dialysis access surgery requires optimizing the unassisted maturation rate. A physiological measure that accounts for the dynamic process of maturation may be more informative than anatomic measurements alone. The results shown here demonstrate that vein distensibility may be a better predictor than absolute vein diameter on standard vein mapping ultrasound examinations.","2024","Journal of vascular surgery"

Although single-item scales are convenient, their diagnostic accuracy remain unclear, and the variability across studies may affect generalizability. This systematic review and meta-analysis evaluates the diagnostic value of single-item fatigue detection scales. We systematically searched CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Embase, and PubMed. Meta-analyses were conducted to calculate pooled sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios, predictive values, and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR). We also calculated the area under a hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristic curve. Subgroup analyses were performed to address heterogeneity. All analyses were done R (version 4.3.1). The study registered in PROSPERO (CRD42023457658). Eleven studies involving 3509 participants were included. Pooled results revealed a sensitivity of 0.89 (95 % CI: 0.82-0.93), specificity of 0.72 (95 % CI: 0.63-0.80), DOR of 19.95 (95 % CI: 10.47-38.04), and an AUC of 0.90 (95 % CI: 0.89-0.91). Moderate to high heterogeneity was observed, influenced by variations in cancer types, study designs, and gold standard references. Single-item fatigue scales demonstrate commendable diagnostic accuracy, comparable to multidimensional scales. Despite study variability, they are effective for routine clinical use to detect and manage fatigue in cancer patients. Future research should focus on standardizing assessment criteria and optimizing the balance between simplicity and diagnostic precision.","2024","Critical reviews in oncology/hematology"

While Sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) has been implicated in the mitigation of POCD, its potential as a predictive biomarker for POCD remains unclear. Patients undergoing CPB cardiac surgery were evaluated for POCD using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. Based on the assessment results, patients were divided into two groups, with further stratification by key factors. The correlation between these risk factors and POCD incidence was analyzed. Odds ratios were calculated for six risk factors, and the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive power of early postoperative serum SIRT1 levels for POCD. Six risk factors-including age, education level, CPB duration, aortic occlusion duration, anesthesia duration, and early postoperative serum SIRT1-were strongly associated with POCD incidence. Patients with POCD had decreased early postoperative serum SIRT1 levels. SIRT1 was found to be a significant predictor of POCD, with high sensitivity and specificity. Additionally, neuron-specific enolase and S100β levels were elevated in POCD patients and negatively correlated with early postoperative serum SIRT1 levels. Early postoperative serum SIRT1 serves as an effective biomarker for predicting POCD, offering both high sensitivity and specificity, and could be used to anticipate the onset of clinical POCD.","2024","The Journal of surgical research"

A total of 114 eligible patients were included, 28 (24.6%) of whom developed a renal flare. Activity index (AI) at biopsy 2 was significantly associated with LN flare (P < .0001). If AI > 1, the OR for LN flare was 23.1 (95%CI, 5.1-103.8, P < .001). For patients with partial clinical remission compared with those with complete clinical remission, the OR for LN flare was 3.0 (95%CI: 1.1-8.3, P = .029). Multivariate analysis showed that anti-dsDNA positivity, presence of cellular/fibrocellular crescent, and endocapillary hypercellularity at biopsy 2 were independent risk factors for LN flare. When residual active histologic lesions were added to clinical variables, the area under the curve of the prediction model for LN flare significantly increased and the misclassification rate significantly decreased. Renal flare in LN patients with clinical remission is strongly associated with the residual active histologic lesions.","2024","Clinical kidney journal"

However, the impact of the cuproptosis-related gene (CRG) dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (DLD) on breast cancer (BC) prognosis remains underexplored. We employed real-time quantitative PCR and multiplexed immunostaining techniques to quantify DLD expression in both BC and the adjacent non-cancerous tissues. Immunofluorescence analysis was employed to assess the influence of DLD on immune cells and immunological checkpoints in the BC microenvironment. DLD knockdown experiments were conducted in BC cell lines MDA-MB-468 and SK-BR-3, with knockdown efficiency validated via western blot. Subsequently, we performed the cell counting kit-8 (CCK-8) assay, clone formation assay, Transwell migration assay, and invasion assay. To construct a prognostic model, we employed a Lasso-Cox regression analysis of immune-related genes associated with DLD. Additionally, we established a competing endogenous RNA network based on CRGs to evaluate potential regulatory pathways. Compared to the adjacent tissues, BC tissues exhibited markedly elevated DLD expression levels. In vitro experiments demonstrated that DLD knockdown effectively inhibited BC cell migration, invasion, and proliferation. DLD exhibited positive correlations with CD68+ macrophages and PD-L1 in the tumor, as well as with macrophages and CD4+ T cells in the stroma. Tumor regions with high DLD expression were enriched in PD-L1 and macrophages, while stromal regions with high DLD expression contained CD4+ T cells and macrophages. The AUC values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival in TCGA-BRCA training set were 0.67, 0.66, and 0.66, respectively. A nomogram with a C-index of 0.715 indicated that risk score, tumor stage, and age could serve as independent prognostic factors for BC. Our findings underscore the significant predictive significance of DLD in BC and its influence on the tumor microenvironment. DLD represents a promising diagnostic and prognostic marker for BC, offering novel avenues for the identification of therapeutic targets and the enhancement of immunotherapy in BC.","2024","Computational and structural biotechnology journal"

The intraprostatic lesion's volume of interest (VOI) was semi-automatically sketched using a threshold of 40 % maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), namely 40%SUVmax-VOI, and seminal vesicle glands were manually contoured, namely SV-VOI. Models were built using a variety of machine learning methods such as logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was calculated for different models, and the prediction performances of radiomics models were compared against the radiologists' assessment. Kaplan-Meier analysis was utilized to assess the effectiveness of selected radiomics features to determine the progression-free survival (PFS) probability. The training set had 112 patients and the test set had 28 patients. The highest AUC for the PET radiomics model of 40%SUVmax-VOI and the PET radiomics model of SV-VOI were 0.85 and 0.96 in the test set, respectively. The PET radiomics model of SV-VOI had a significantly higher AUC compared to the radiologists' assessment (P < 0.05). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that PET radiomics features were associated with PFS in patients with PCa. Radiomics models developed by preoperative [18F]-PSMA-1007 PET were proven useful in predicting SVI, and PSMA PET radiomics features were correlated with PFS, suggesting that the PSMA PET radiomics might be an accurate tool for PCa characterization.","2024","Computers in biology and medicine"

The Kaplan-Meier method was utilized to estimate the cure rate at one year. Moreover, the Cox regression model was used to assess the association of antioxidant factors with the prognosis of patients with HZ neuralgia. Lastly, ROC curves were generated to predict the effect of albumin (ALB), uric acid (UA), and combined ALB-UA (Co ALB-UA) on the patient's prognosis. A total of 225 patients were included in this study: 138 women and 87 men, with the median age of 62 years. The cure rate at one year was significantly higher in the ALB, UA, total bilirubin level (TBL), and homocysteine (HCY) groups than in the low value group (83.1%vs 41.6%, 73.7% vs 55.0%, 70.4% vs 52.1%, 71.3% vs 57.3% respectively, P < 0.05). The multifactorial Cox regression model indicated that the preoperative Numeric Rating Scale pain score (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.630; 95% CI, 0.437-0.907; P < 0.05), ALB (HR = 3.221; 95% CI, 2.212-4.690; P < 0.05), and UA (HR = 1.691; 95% CI, 1.182-2.419; P < 0.05) were identified as independent protective factors for a complete cure. An ROC curve analysis showed that the area under the curve of ALB, TBL, UA, HCY, and Co ALB-UA was 0.731 (95% CI, 0.658-0.805), 0.597 (95% CI, 0.518-0.675), 0.704 (95% CI, 0.633-0.774), 0.587 (95% CI, 0.508-0.666), and 0.777 (95% CI, 0.716-0.837) respectively. Additionally, the Co ALB-UA was more important than the individual antioxidant factors in evaluating a prognosis. Major limitations of this study are its nonrandomized, single-center, and retrospective design. ALB and UA are independent risk factors and reflect the prognosis of patients with HZ neuralgia. Furthermore, their combined application may improve prediction accuracy.","2024","Pain physician"

We hypothesized that prediction models using data obtained during pregnancy can accurately predict the future development of metabolic syndrome. This study aimed to develop machine learning models to predict the development of metabolic syndrome using factors ascertained in nulliparous pregnant individuals. This was a secondary analysis of a prospective cohort study (Nulliparous Pregnancy Outcomes Study: Monitoring Mothers-to-Be Heart Health Study [nuMoM2b-HHS]). Data were collected from October 2010 to October 2020, and analyzed from July 2023 to October 2023. Participants had in-person visits 2 to 7 years after their first delivery. The primary outcome was metabolic syndrome, defined by the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria, which was measured within 2 to 7 years after delivery. A total of 127 variables that were obtained during pregnancy were evaluated. The data set was randomly split into a training set (70%) and a test set (30%). We developed a random forest model and a lasso regression model using variables obtained during pregnancy. We compared the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for both models. Using the model with the better area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, we developed models that included fewer variables based on SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values and compared them with the original model. The final model chosen would have fewer variables and noninferior areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve. A total of 4225 individuals met the inclusion criteria; the mean (standard deviation) age was 27.0 (5.6) years. Of these, 754 (17.8%) developed metabolic syndrome. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the random forest model was 0.878 (95% confidence interval, 0.846-0.909), which was higher than the 0.850 of the lasso model (95% confidence interval, 0.811-0.888; P<.001). Therefore, random forest models using fewer variables were developed. The random forest model with the top 3 variables (high-density lipoprotein, insulin, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) was chosen as the final model because it had the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.867 (95% confidence interval, 0.839-0.895), which was not inferior to the original model (P=.08). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the final model in the test set was 0.847 (95% confidence interval, 0.821-0.873). An online application of the final model was developed (https://kawakita.shinyapps.io/metabolic/). We developed a model that can accurately predict the development of metabolic syndrome in 2 to 7 years after delivery.","2024","American journal of obstetrics and gynecology"

This study aimed to develop a prediction model for new-onset AF in patients with Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) receiving RT alone or as a part of their multi-modal treatment. Patients with stage I-IV NSCLC treated with curative-intent conventional photon RT were included. The baseline electrocardiogram (ECG) was compared with follow-up ECGs to identify the occurrence of new-onset AF. A wide range of potential clinical predictors and dose-volume measures on the whole heart and six automatically contoured cardiac substructures, including chambers and conduction nodes, were considered for statistical modeling. Internal validation with optimism-correction was performed. A nomogram was made. 374 patients (mean age 69 ± 10 years, 57 % male) were included. At baseline, 9.1 % of patients had AF, and 42 (11.2 %) patients developed new-onset AF.

However, identifying treatment-sensitive patients at the early phase of therapy remains a problem, hampering disease management and raising the possibility of disease progression during treatment. In this retrospective analysis, we collected 2-deoxy-2-[F-18] fluoro-d-glucose (18F-FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)/computed tomography (CT) images of primary tumor sites and axillary areas and reciprocal clinical pathological data from 121 patients who underwent neoadjuvant treatment and surgery in our center. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate features associated with pathological complete response (pCR). An 18F-FDG PET/CT-based prediction model was trained, and the performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC). The maximum standard uptake values (SUVmax) of 18F-FDG PET/CT were a powerful indicator of tumor status. The SUVmax values of axillary areas were closely related to metastatic lymph node counts (R = 0.62). Moreover, the early SUVmax reduction rates (between baseline and second cycle of neoadjuvant treatment) were statistically different between pCR and non-pCR patients. The early SUVmax reduction rates-based model showed great ability to predict pCR (AUC = 0.89), with all molecular subtypes (HR+HER2-, HR+HER2+, HR-HER2+, and HR-HER2-) considered. Our research proved that the SUVmax reduction rate of 18F-FDG PET/CT contributed to the early prediction of pCR, providing rationales for utilizing PET/CT in NAT in the future.","2024","The oncologist"

An intraoperative liquid biopsy (ILB) based on tumor cell mobilization could help to detect R1 resection intraoperatively. To evaluate the potential role of the intraoperative circulating tumor cells (CTCs) and cluster mobilization on the R0/R1 detection. Sixty-three patients with resectable PDAC of the head of the pancreas were prospective enrolled under the CETUPANC trial. Open pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD) was done in all patients. Intraoperative CTCs and clusters were determined during PD. The overall rate of R1 resection was 34.9% (22/63 patients). Multivariate analysis showed that factors associated with R1 resection (AUC=0.920) were the presence of undifferentiated G3 tumor (P=0.017), microscopic vascular invasion (P=0.016), and the intraoperative increase of both free CTCs and clusters in portal vein determination from the beginning to the end of the surgery (P=0.002 and P=0.005, respectively). A specific logistic regression model, including delta end to baseline CTCs and cluster mobilization to achieve a combined cut-off to detect R1 detection was calculated (AUC=0.799). The obtained R1-index based on ILB had 84% of sensitivity and 68% of specificity to detect R1 resection. The ILB based on the intraoperative mobilization of CTCs and clusters from the beginning to the end of the PD was a predictive factor to detect R1 resection in patients with PDAC.","2024","International journal of surgery (London, England)"

Following a mixed-longitudinal approach, physical, physiological, psychological, skill-, health-, age-, and position-related parameters were collected from 409 male players (980 datapoints) from the U12 to U19 age groups. Supervised machine learning classifiers were used to predict the selection status regarding the next age group. The XGBoost models (ROC-AUC: 0.69, F1-Score: 0.84) revealed that physical and physiological (linear sprint, change-of-direction sprint, countermovement jump, aerobic speed reserve) as well as skill-related parameters (soccer-specific skill) were most important for being selected or de-selected regarding the next age group across the entire sample and all age groups. The majority of psychological parameters (motive structure, motive attention, motive competition, cognitive flexibility) were of medium importance. No clear pattern was observed for the health-, age-, and position-related parameters. Our study provides insights into key parameters for talent selection thereby contributing to an overall talent management strategy in highly trained youth soccer players.

This study included 530 singleton mothers with E-GDM who underwent a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in the first trimester at Keio University Hospital between January 2013 and December 2021. E-GDM can be classified according to its management into only diet therapy until delivery (Diet E-GDM), insulin therapy started before 24 gestational weeks (EarlyIns E-GDM), and insulin therapy started after 24 gestational weeks (LateIns E-GDM). We analyzed the risk factors for EarlyIns E-GDM. Patients with EarlyIns E-GDM had a significantly higher maternal age at delivery, pre-pregnancy BMI, first trimester hemoglobin A1c, 1 h plasma glucose levels (1 h-PG), and 2 h-PG, as well as a more pronounced initial increase and subsequent decrease, compared with those in the Diet E-GDM group. However, the Apgar scores at both 1 and 5 min were significantly lower in patients with EarlyIns E-GDM than in those with Diet E-GDM. The number of abnormal values in the OGTT showed the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for predicting EarlyIns E-GDM (0.83, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.86), followed by the 1 h-PG value (AUC: 0.81, 95% CI: 0.77-0.85). The initial increase showed the third largest AUC (0.78, 95% CI: 0.74-0.82).

We retrospectively collected 150 patients with AIS who underwent pre-treatment CT perfusion (CTP) evaluation and subsequent EVT from April 2018 to April 2022. Three-phases (peak arterial phase, peak venous phase, late venous phase) CTA was reconstructed from CTP raw data, and VO was evaluated on three-phases CTA, respectively. Favorable VO was regarded as a cortical vein opacification score of 3-6, and unfavorable VO as a score of 0-2. Good outcome was defined as modified Rankin Scale score of 0-2 at 90 days after EVT. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to explore the predictors of good outcome. Prognostic value was assessed and compared using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and Delong test. We found that good outcome was achieved in 85 (56.7%) patients. Among the mCTA-derived VO profiles, only favorable peak venous phase VO was found to be independently associated with good outcome (P < 0.001). After integrating favorable peak venous phase VO with lower post-treatment National Institute of Health Stroke Scale score at 24 hours, successful recanalization and favorable hypoperfusion intensity ratio, the predictive ability for a good outcome was significantly improved than before (area under the ROC curve; 0.947 vs 0.881; P = 0.002).

Courses are associated with a risk of renal injury, delayed elimination, and increased systemic toxicity. Recently hypoalbuminemia has been recognized as yet another risk factor. To examine the impact of serum albumin we reviewed 325 HDMTX 5 g/m2 courses in a cohort of 51 children treated on the NOPHO ALL 2008 protocol, dividing the courses into four groups with different levels of baseline albumin (A < 25 g/L, B 25-29 g/L, C 30-34 g/L and D ≥ 35 g/L). Hypoalbuminemia was present in 51% of the courses, mostly in the early phases of chemotherapy while asparaginase therapy is ongoing, and especially if given less than 2 weeks after a dose (78%). Hypoalbuminemia had a significant impact on the end-of-infusion serum MTX, depending on the degree of hypoalbuminemia: MTX > 150 µM was seen in 37%, 32%, 20% and 8% in groups A to D. Serum albumin < 30 g/L was significantly associated with low MTX clearance < 10 L/h/1.73m2 (78% vs. 36%) and high AUC ≥ 1000 µM*h (44% vs. 31%). The frequency of rising creatinine or prolonged elimination was not increased, but the risk of stomatitis was significantly higher (42% vs. 19%). Low serum albumin is caused by concurrent asparaginase therapy and has a clinically significant impact on MTX disposition. Guidelines for administering HDMTX may need adjustment if serum albumin < 30 g/L, and, if possible, HDMTX courses should not be scheduled soon after asparaginase doses.","2024","Cancer chemotherapy and pharmacology"

Data from a retrospective study conducted between July 2018 and July 2021 were collected and analysed. Patients were categorized into three groups via hierarchical clustering based on the course of facial erythema: early remission, low remission and persistent residual. LightGBM, a supervised gradient boosting decision tree algorithm, was employed to discern group differences and construct a prediction model. The model incorporated patient demographic and clinical profiles, including pre- and post-treatment examinations. The model's performance was evaluated using accuracy and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The binary classification model demonstrated an accuracy of 89.10% and an AUC of 0.862 when distinguishing between early remission and persistent residual patients. The eight prominent factors associated with facial erythema severity included age, sex, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), immunoglobulin E (IgE), eosinophil count, white blood cell count, Alnus allergy and cedar allergy. This study has two main significances: first, three clusters were identified through unsupervised learning; second, a classification model was constructed that proved more accurate than random prediction.

However, it remains largely unknown what the specific role and clinical significance of MCM3 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) are. We integrated high-throughput data from PAAD worldwide to analyse the expression level of MCM3 mRNA. We used immunohistochemistry to analyse MCM3 protein expression levels in 145 cases in the PAAD group and 29 cases in the non-PAAD group. We also mainly analysed the necessity of MCM3 for PAAD growth based on CRISPR screen data. In addition, we used enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction networks to explore the molecular mechanism of MCM3 in PAAD. We also analysed the correlation between MCM3 expression, components of the immune microenvironment in PAAD tissue and clinical prognosis. In PAAD, we observed for the first time that MCM3 was significantly highly expressed at both the mRNA (SMD = 0.67, 95% CI: 0.38 ∼ 0.96) and the protein level (p < 0.05). The mRNA (AUC = 0.78, 95% CI: 0.74 ∼ 0.81; sensitivity = 0.66, 95% CI: 0.55 ∼ 0.76; specificity = 0.76, 95% CI: 0.67 ∼ 0.84) and protein (AUC = 0.929) expression levels of MCM3 had a good ability to distinguish between PAAD and non-PAAD tissue. There was heterogeneity reflected by the differential expression of MCM3 protein in PAAD cells. MCM3 played an essential role in PAAD growth, through abnormal DNA replication, p53 signalling and cell cycle checkpoints. PAAD with high MCM3 expression was sensitive to c-75, brivanib, flavopiridol and VNLG/124 drugs, with stable molecular docking models. MCM3 is likely to be a critical element in promoting the initiation and growth of PAAD. Flavopiridol may exert its anti-PAAD effect through the interaction between MCM3, classic CDK1 targets in the cell cycle checkpoint and p53 pathway as well as related molecules in other pathways.","2024","Annals of medicine"

Analytical predictive models were developed using Random Forest from the dataset of telomere-associated variables (TAV). Receiver Operating Characteristic curves were used to characterize model performance. From 233 patients undergoing lung cancer diagnosis, 106 patients aged 55-75 with lung cancer or lung cancer and COPD were selected. A control group (N = 453) included individuals of similar age with COPD or healthy. Telomere analysis showed that patients in the cancer cohort had a higher proportion of short telomeres compared to the control cohort. A TAV-based predictive model assuming a prevalence of 5 % of lung cancer among screened subjects showed an AUC of 0.98 %, a positive predictive value of 0.60 (95 % CI, 0.49-0.70) and a negative predictive value of 0.99 (95 % CI, 0.98-0.99) for prediction of lung cancer. The results of this study suggest that TAV analysis in peripheral lymphocytes can be considered a useful diagnostic tool during screening for lung cancer in high-risk patients. TAV-based models could improve the predictive power of current initial diagnostic pathways, but further work is needed to integrate them into routine clinical evaluation.

Effective timely detection may improve the outcome of SI-AKI. Kidney-derived cell-free DNA (cfDNA) may provide new insight into understanding and identifying SI-AKI. Plasma cfDNA from 82 healthy individuals, 7 patients with sepsis non-acute kidney injury (SN-AKI), and 9 patients with SI-AKI was subjected to genomic methylation sequencing. We deconstructed the relative contribution of cfDNA from different cell types based on cell-specific methylation markers and focused on exploring the association between kidney-derived cfDNA and SI-AKI.Based on the deconvolution of the cfDNA methylome: SI-AKI patients displayed the elevated cfDNA concentrations with an increased contribution of kidney epithelial cells (kidney-Ep) DNA; kidney-Ep derived cfDNA achieved high accuracy in distinguishing SI-AKI from SN-AKI (AUC = 0.92, 95% CI 0.7801-1); the higher kidney-ep cfDNA concentrations tended to correlate with more advanced stages of SI-AKI; strikingly, SN-AKI patients with potential kidney damage unmet by SI-AKI criteria showed higher levels of kidney-Ep derived cfDNA than healthy individuals. The autonomous screening of kidney-Ep (n = 24) and kidney endothelial (kidney-Endo, n = 12) specific methylation markers indicated the unique identity of kidney-Ep/kidney-Endo compared with other cell types, and its targeted assessment reproduced the main findings of the deconvolution of the cfDNA methylome. Our study first demonstrates that kidney-Ep- and kidney-Endo-specific methylation markers can serve as a novel marker for SI-AKI emergence, supporting further exploration of the utility of kidney-specific cfDNA methylation markers in the study of SI-AKI.","2024","Epigenetics"

This study conducted a retrospective analysis using latent growth mixture models to identify heterogeneous trajectories within a clinical population, subsequently developing machine learning models to predict clinical outcomes based on baseline characteristics and symptom measures. The study analyzed approximately 15,000 clients aged 18-89 in a real-world clinical setting, treated for up to 180-days between 2015 and 2020. Three distinct groups were identified: Low-Low (stable low scores), High-Low (improving scores), and High-High (stable high scores), representing 56%, 18%, and 26% of the cohort, respectively. Significant differences were observed in baseline factors and outcome assessments across these groups. The machine learning model demonstrated balanced accuracies of 0.67-0.93, and ROC-AUC values between 0.87 and 0.97 in predicting group membership from baseline data. Key predictors included baseline PHQ-9 scores, sex, age, and PTSD diagnosis. Prospective application of the model accurately categorized new client data, aligning predictions with observed outcomes. The study highlights the potential of machine learning in clinical settings to predict client outcomes, offering valuable insights based on initial data, potentially enhancing treatment personalization and efficacy. Further research should explore the impact of individual treatment modalities to validate the model's clinical utility.","2025","Journal of psychiatric research"

This retrospective study enrolled LARC patients who underwent preoperative rectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Based on histologic assessment, the patients were divided into a pathological complete response (pCR) group or a non-pCR group. APTw histogram features, apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), and clinical parameters were analyzed. Mann-Whitney U-test, Spearman rank correlation, and univariate and multivariate logistic regression were used for statistical analysis. The predictive performances of different models were evaluated by the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). One-hundred forty-five patients were included (mean age, 61.6 years ± 11.8 [SD]; 87 men). pCR patients exhibited lower pre-treatment ADC value, higher pre-treatment APTw-10%, APTw-90%, minimum, maximum, median, mean, range, and root mean square (RMS) of the primary tumor compared to non-pCR patients (all p < 0.05). APTw-10%, APTw-90%, maximum, mean, median, minimum, range, and RMS showed negative correlations with the tumor regression grade (TRG) category (r ranged between -0.457 and -0.173; all p < 0.005). Skewness, kurtosis, and entropy exhibited positive correlations with the TRG category (r = 0.278, 0.319, and 0.324, respectively; all p < 0.05). The combined model had a higher AUC of 0.930, with 93.9% sensitivity and 83.9% specificity. Histogram analysis of pre-treatment APTw may hold promise as a novel approach for predicting the response of LARC patients to nCRT. Question Predicting response to nCRT is crucial for early stratified management of LARC patients; however, current radiological studies remain inconclusive. Finding LARC patients with pCR is correlated with higher pre-treatment APTw intensity-related and lower shape-related histogram features.

To develop and validate a fusion model on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI for identifying highly aggressive HCC. Retrospective. 341 patients (M/F = 294/47) with surgically resected HCC, divided into a training cohort (n = 177), temporal validation cohort (n = 77), and multiscanner validation cohort (n = 87). 3T, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI with T1-weighted volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination gradient-echo sequences, especially arterial phase (AP) and hepatobiliary phase (HBP, 80-100 min). Clinical factors and diagnosis assessment based on radiologic morphology characteristics associated with highly aggressive HCCs were evaluated. The radiomics signatures were extracted from AP and HBP. Multivariable logistic regression was performed to construct clinical-radiologic morphology (CR) model and clinical-radiologic morphology-radiomics (CRR) model. A nomogram based on the optimal model was established. Early recurrence-free survival (RFS) was evaluated in actual groups and risk groups calculated by the nomogram. The performance was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis, calibration curves analysis, and decision curves. Early RFS was evaluated by using Kaplan-Meier analysis. A P value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The CRR model incorporating corona enhancement, cloud-like hyperintensity on HBP, and radiomics signatures showed the highest diagnostic performance. The area under the curves (AUCs) of CRR were significantly higher than those of the CR model (AUC = 0.883 vs. 0.815, respectively, for the training cohort), 0.874 vs. 0.769 for temporal validation, and 0.892 vs. 0.792 for multiscanner validation. In both actual and risk groups, highly and low aggressive HCCs showed statistically significant differences in early recurrence. The clinical-radiologic morphology-radiomics model on gadobenate dimeglumine-enhanced MRI has potential to identify highly aggressive HCCs and non-invasively obtain prognostic information. 4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.","2024","Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI"

However, existing methods to predict an individual's sleep-loss phenotype are not scalable or involve effort-dependent neurobehavioural tests. To overcome these limitations, we sought to predict an individual's level of resilience or vulnerability to sleep loss using electroencephalographic (EEG) features obtained from routine night sleep. To this end, we retrospectively analysed five studies in which 96 healthy young adults (41 women) completed a laboratory baseline-sleep phase followed by a sleep-loss challenge. After classifying subjects into sleep-loss phenotypic groups, we extracted two EEG features from the first sleep cycle (median duration: 1.6 h), slow-wave activity (SWA) power and SWA rise rate, from four channels during the baseline nights. Using these data, we developed two sets of logistic regression classifiers (resilient versus not-resilient and vulnerable versus not-vulnerable) to predict the probability of sleep-loss resilience or vulnerability, respectively, and evaluated model performance using test datasets not used in model development. Consistently, the most predictive features came from the left cerebral hemisphere. For the resilient versus not-resilient classifiers, we obtained an average testing performance of 0.68 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72 for accuracy, 0.50 for sensitivity, 0.84 for specificity, 0.61 for positive predictive value, and 3.59 for likelihood ratio. We obtained similar performance for the vulnerable versus not-vulnerable classifiers. These results indicate that logistic regression classifiers based on SWA power and SWA rise rate from routine night sleep can largely predict an individual's sleep-loss phenotype.","2024","Journal of sleep research"

Conflicting evidence suggests either similarity or distinction in neural processing, with implications for bilingual patients with brain tumors. Preserving dual-language functions after surgery requires considering pre-diagnosis neuroplastic changes. Here, we combine univariate and multivariate fMRI methodologies to test a group of healthy Spanish-Basque bilinguals and a group of bilingual patients with gliomas affecting the language-dominant hemisphere while they overtly produced sentences in either their dominant or non-dominant language. Findings from healthy participants revealed the presence of a shared neural system for both languages, while also identifying regions with distinct language-dependent activation and lateralization patterns. Specifically, while the dominant language engaged a more left-lateralized network, speech production in the non-dominant language relied on the recruitment of a bilateral basal ganglia-thalamo-cortical circuit. Notably, based on language lateralization patterns, we were able to robustly decode (AUC: 0.80 ± 0.18) the language being used. Conversely, bilingual patients exhibited bilateral activation patterns for both languages. For the dominant language, regions such as the cerebellum, thalamus, and caudate acted in concert with the sparsely activated language-specific nodes. In the case of the non-dominant language, the recruitment of the default mode network was notably prominent. These results demonstrate the compensatory engagement of non-language-specific networks in the preservation of bilingual speech production, even in the face of pathological conditions. Overall, our findings underscore the pervasive impact of dual-language experience on brain functional (re)organization, both in health and disease.","2024","Brain structure & function"

Conducted as a prospective cohort study at Taian City Central Hospital, participants included individuals with unilateral, closed clavicle fractures who underwent ORIF (n = 763, 546 males and 217 females). Plasma samples were collected preoperatively for exosome isolation and miRNA extraction, specifically analyzing miR-100, miR-124, miR-125b, and miR-21 using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Patients were classified into union and nonunion groups based on follow-up outcomes at a minimum of three months post-surgery. Out of 763 patients, 720 achieved union while 43 developed nonunion. Notably, the nonunion group exhibited significantly elevated exosomal miR-21 expression levels. Univariate analysis demonstrated a significant association between high miR-21 expression and nonunion occurrence (Relative Risk [RR] = 1.82, P = 0.0004). Multivariate logistic regression analysis corroborated this association (RR > 1.8, P < 0.05), adjusting for covariates. High miR-21 levels (3.12 to 7.89) were robustly associated with nonunion outcomes (RR > 4), independent of other factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis indicated certain clinical diagnostic value of miR-21 for predicting nonunion (Area Under the Curve [AUC] = 0.7885). The elevated preoperative levels of exosomal miR-21 were significantly associated with an increased risk of bone nonunion at three months ORIF in patients with clavicle fractures, indicating that miR-21 holds potential as a non-specific predictive molecule.","2024","Injury"

We aimed to investigate potential biomarkers of sarcopenia using metabolomics. After non-targeted metabolome profiling of plasma from mice of an aging mouse model of sarcopenia, sphingolipid metabolites and muscle cells from the animal model were evaluated using targeted metabolome profiling. The associations between sphingolipid metabolites identified from mouse and cell studies and sarcopenia status were assessed in men in an age-matched discovery (72 cases and 72 controls) and validation (36 cases and 128 controls) cohort; women with sarcopenia (36 cases and 36 controls) were also included as a discovery cohort. Both non-targeted and targeted metabolome profiling in the experimental studies showed an association between sphingolipid metabolites, including ceramides (CERs) and sphingomyelins (SMs), and sarcopenia. Plasma SM (16:0), CER (24:1), and SM (24:1) levels in men with sarcopenia were significantly higher in the discovery cohort than in the controls (all P < 0.05). There were no significant differences in plasma sphingolipid levels for women with or without sarcopenia.

To investigate noninvasive diagnostic biomarkers and potential treatment targets to improve women's fertility. RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) was conducted on PBMC samples from six patients with PCOS and six healthy controls. qRT-PCR validation was carried out in 68 subjects. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to assess the combined impact of biomarkers. A total of 186 differentially expressed genes (DEG) were found between patients and controls (log2FC >1, p < 0.05). Enrichment analysis revealed cytokine-mediated signaling pathways, cytokine activity, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. RNA sequencing showed consistency with qRT-PCR. Women with PCOS had significantly higher levels of AQP9 (p < 0.001), PROK2 (p = 0.001), and S100A12 (p < 0.001) expression compared to controls. AQP9 (AUC = 0.77), PROK2 (AUC = 0.71), and S100A12 (AUC = 0.82) adequately discriminated women with PCOS from healthy controls. In addition, multiple logistic regression on biomarkers resulted in a significant diagnostic power with an AUC = 0.89, 95 % CI: 0.81-0.97, p < 0.0001. Further associations were analyzed between relative gene expression and clinical, anthropometric, hormonal, and ultrasonographic data. Dysregulated RNA expression in PBMCs may contribute to an increased risk of PCOS and serve as a potential diagnostic biomarker. The involvement of inflammatory and cytokine-related pathways supports the notion that PCOS is a chronic inflammatory condition.","2024","Archives of medical research"

To evaluate the cutoff value of FNA-Tg, we conducted a retrospective study of patients with neck masses outside the thyroid who pre-operatively underwent both FNAC and FNA-Tg, followed by pathological examination at our hospital from October 2015 to September 2020. The cutoff value of FNA-Tg was calculated using the receiver operating characteristic curve. Among 210 lesions, 57 were of thyroid origin and 153 lesions were not of thyroid origin. A high FNA-Tg value was observed in the lesions of thyroid origin (P: 0.001), and the cutoff value at the minimum point of 100% specificity was 32.2 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 87.7%. Regarding the effect of serum anti-Tg antibodies, FNA-Tg values were significantly lower or not significantly different depending on the grouping, warranting further studies. Among the cases with papillary thyroid carcinoma, the sensitivity of FNAC and FNA-Tg was 71.4% and 87.5%, respectively. The cutoff value of FNA-Tg for the differential diagnosis of neck masses was higher compared to previous reports because some metastatic lymph nodes of carcinomas and lesions, other than lymph nodes, exhibited higher FNA-Tg values. Therefore, if FNA-Tg is to be used as a screening test for the differential diagnosis of neck masses in patients without proven thyroid carcinoma, it is necessary to establish a higher cutoff value.","2024","Endocrine-related cancer"

PhA reflects cellular membrane integrity and, as a result, has been considered a marker of fluid distribution, making it a potential prognostic indicator. A growing body of research demonstrates independent associations between PhA and muscle strength, mass, and composition. In this context, PhA has the extra potential to serve as a marker of muscle quality. However, the evidence supporting its use for this purpose is not well established. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between PhA and markers of muscle quality. This systematic review and meta-analysis (Internal Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews - PROSPERO on a registration code: CRD42024507853) focused on observational studies assessing the relationship between PhA and markers of both concepts of muscle quality: the muscle quality index (MQI: strength by a unit of mass) and the muscle composition (i.e., skeletal muscle radiodensity [SMD], muscle echogenicity, muscle fat fraction, inter- and intramuscular adiposity). Risk of bias was assessed using the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) and Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2), while the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) approach. Meta-analyses with a random-effects model were conducted. Seventeen studies were included in this systematic review, encompassing 2710 participants. Meta-analyses demonstrated that PhA had a moderate positive correlation coefficient with SMD (4 studies, 924 participants; r = 0.54, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.38 to 0.69, heterogeneity (I2) = 92 %) and good accuracy (85 %) for classifying low SMD (2 studies, 390 participants; Area Under the Curve - AUCpooled 0.85, 95 % CI 0.78 to 0.92, I2 = 0 %). PhA was inversely-moderately correlated with muscle echogenicity (8 studies, 1401 participants; r = - 0.42, 95 % CI - 0.57 to - 0.24, I2 = 82 %) and positively-weakly correlated with MQI (2 studies, 191 participants; r = 0.36, 95 % CI 0.21 to 0.49, I2 = 17 %). All studies had a higher risk of bias. The certainty of evidence ranged from low to very low. Despite technical challenges, this study demonstrates the potential of PhA as a surrogate marker for muscle quality, particularly expressing muscle composition (SMD). Future studies should utilize BIA with standardized protocols to potentially establish specific cutoff values for PhA, thereby enhancing its diagnostic accuracy and clinical applicability. These studies could additionally explore the mechanisms underlying the associations between PhA and muscle quality aspects. In cases where technical factors are not easily controlled, the use of standardized PhA (SPhA), which converts PhA into Z-scores, could be beneficial. Although this warrants investigation, this approach (SPhA) has the potential to account for variables such as age, sex, device differences, and health status.","2024","Clinical nutrition (Edinburgh, Scotland)"

To determine the potential of brain signal variability as a diagnostic tool, we assessed the coefficient of variation of the BOLD signal (CVBOLD) in 234 participants spanning bvFTD (n = 53), AD (n = 17), SZ (n = 23), and controls (n = 141). All underwent functional and structural MRI scans. Data unveiled a notable increase in CVBOLD in bvFTD patients across both datasets (local and international, p < 0.05), revealing an association with clinical scores (CDR and MMSE, r = 0.46 and r = -0.48, p < 0.0001). While SZ and control group demonstrated no significant differences, a comparative analysis between AD and bvFTD patients spotlighted elevated CVBOLD in the frontopolar cortices for the latter (p < 0.05). Furthermore, CVBOLD not only presented excellent diagnostic accuracy for bvFTD (AUC 0.78-0.95) but also showcased longitudinal repeatability. During a one-year follow-up, the CVBOLD levels increased by an average of 35% in the bvFTD group, compared to a 2% increase in the control group (p < 0.05). Our findings suggest that CVBOLD holds promise as a biomarker for bvFTD, offering potential for monitoring disease progression and differentiating bvFTD from AD and SZ.","2024","Journal of cerebral blood flow and metabolism : official journal of the International Society of Cerebral Blood Flow and Metabolism"

This therapy hinges on elevating serum osmolality, creating an osmotic gradient that draws excess water from the brain's cellular and interstitial compartments and effectively reducing cerebral edema. Given this information, we hypothesized that the serum hyperosmolality prior to any treatment could significantly impact the clinical outcomes of patients with severe TBI, potentially mitigating secondary cerebral edema after trauma. Data were extracted from the Korean Multi-center Traumatic Brain Injury data bank, encompassing 4628 patients with TBI admitted between January 2016 and December 2018. Of these, 507 patients diagnosed with severe TBI (Glasgow Coma Scale score < 9) were selected for comprehensive analysis across four data domains: clinical, laboratory, initial computed tomography scan, and treatment. Serum osmolality was assessed prior to treatment, and the hyperosmolar group was defined by a pretreatment serum osmolality exceeding 320 mOsm/L, whereas favorable outcomes were characterized by a modified Rankin Scale score of ≤ 3 at 6 months after trauma. Multivariate regression with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and propensity score matching were used to dissect the data set. Multivariate analysis showed serum osmolality is significantly associated with clinical outcome in patients with severe TBI (p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff value for predicting favorable outcome was 331 mOsm/L, with a sensitivity of 38.9% and a specificity of 87.7%. Notably, the propensity score matching analysis comparing patients with pretreatment serum hyperosmolality with those without indicated a markedly improved functional outcome in the former group (32.5% vs 18.8%, p = 0.025). The present study has uncovered a significant correlation between the pretreatment serum osmolality and the clinical outcomes of patients with severe TBI. These findings offer a novel perspective, indicating that a serum hyperosmolality prior to any treatment might potentially have a neuroprotective effect in patients with severe TBI.","2024","Neurocritical care"
955,"39270533","MMGCN: Multi-modal multi-view graph convolutional networks for cancer prognosis prediction.","Accurate prognosis prediction for cancer patients plays a significant role in the formulation of treatment strategies, considerably impacting personalized medicine. Recent advancements in this field indicate that integrating information from various modalities, such as genetic and clinical data, and developing multi-modal deep learning models can enhance prediction accuracy. However, most existing multi-modal deep learning methods either overlook patient similarities that benefit prognosis prediction or fail to effectively capture diverse information due to measuring patient similarities from a single perspective. To address these issues, a novel framework called multi-modal multi-view graph convolutional networks (MMGCN) is proposed for cancer prognosis prediction. Initially, we utilize the similarity network fusion (SNF) algorithm to merge patient similarity networks (PSNs), individually constructed using gene expression, copy number alteration, and clinical data, into a fused PSN for integrating multi-modal information. To capture diverse perspectives of patient similarities, we treat the fused PSN as a multi-view graph by considering each single-edge-type subgraph as a view graph, and propose multi-view graph convolutional networks (GCNs) with a view-level attention mechanism. Moreover, an edge homophily prediction module is designed to alleviate the adverse effects of heterophilic edges on the representation power of GCNs. Finally, comprehensive representations of patient nodes are obtained to predict cancer prognosis. Experimental results demonstrate that MMGCN outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on four public datasets, including METABRIC, TCGA-BRCA, TCGA-LGG, and TCGA-LUSC, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve achieving 0.827 ± 0.005, 0.805 ± 0.014, 0.925 ± 0.007, and 0.746 ± 0.013, respectively. Our study reveals the effectiveness of the proposed MMGCN, which deeply explores patient similarities related to different modalities from a broad perspective, in enhancing the performance of multi-modal cancer prognosis prediction.

Among its nonmotor symptoms, cognitive decline (CD) is a precursor to dementia and represents a critical target for early risk assessment and diagnosis. Accurate CD prediction is crucial for timely intervention and tailored management of at-risk patients. This study used machine learning (ML) techniques to predict the CD risk over five-year in early-stage PD. Methods: Data from the Early Parkinson's Disease Longitudinal Singapore (2014 to 2018) was used to predict CD defined as a one-unit annual decrease or a one-unit decline in Montreal Cognitive Assessment over two consecutive years. Four ML methods-AutoScore, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors and Neural Network-were applied using baseline demographics, clinical assessments and blood biomarkers. Results: Variable selection identified key predictors of CD, including education year, diastolic lying blood pressure, diastolic standing blood pressure, systolic lying blood pressure, Hoehn and Yahr scale, body mass index, phosphorylated tau at threonine 181, total tau, Neurofilament light chain and suppression of tumorigenicity 2. Random Forest was the most effective, achieving an AUC of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89, 0.97), using 10-fold cross-validation. Conclusions: Here, we demonstrate that ML-based models can identify early-stage PD patients at high risk for CD, supporting targeted interventions and improved PD management.","2024","Biomedicines"

Patients who underwent hUCB-MSC implantation for MFC cartilage defects involved in isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis were included. The patients were divided into 2 groups, those with MFC defects located within the anterior-central portion (group A) and those with MFC defects extending to the posterior portion (group P). Cartilage regeneration was assessed using the Magnetic Resonance Observation of Cartilage Repair Tissue (MOCART) 2.0 scores. MFC cartilage defects were subdivided into anterior, central, and posterior regions. The total, regional MOCART scores, and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) were evaluated. Overall, 43 patients were included in this study (group A: 31 patients, group P: 12 patients), with 30 of 43 undergoing combined high tibial osteotomy. Cartilage defect size was significantly larger in group P than in group A (7.8 ± 1.9 cm2 vs 5.7 ± 2.4 cm2, P = .009). Group A demonstrated a significantly greater total MOCART score compared with group P (55.0 ± 12.3 vs 40.4 ± 9.2, P = .001). PROs at final follow-up showed significant improvement compared with preoperative values in both groups (all P < .001), with no significant differences in PROs between groups. The mean follow-ups for each group were 29.7 and 32.5 months, respectively. Defect size were significantly associated with the total MOCART score (P = .026) and unsatisfactory outcome (MOCART < 60) (P = .012, odds ratio 2.674). The cut-off value for defect size was 6.3 cm2 (area under the curve, 0.905; P < .001).

This prospective study enrolled 107 young individuals with unilateral symptomatic CNLBP (56 cases) and a normal cohort (51 cases). All subjects underwent conventional lumbar sequences, T2 mapping, and IDEAL-IQ scans at 3T. T2 values and fat fraction (FF) of bilateral multifidus (mid-levels of L2-L5 vertebrae) and erector spinae (mid-levels of L1-L4 vertebrae) were measured. CNLBP severity, Japanese Orthopedic Association (JOA) score, and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) score were recorded. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to compare parameter differences between painful and non-painful sides in the case group. Mann-Whitney U tests were employed to evaluate differences between the case and normal group. Logistic regression analysis was conducted to identify predictive factors and to establish a combined model. In the case group, erector spinae FF values (L4 level), erector spinae T2 values (L1, L2, and L4 levels), and multifidus T2 values (L4 and L5 levels) were higher on the painful side (P<0.05). Multifidus T2 values (L5 level) and FF values (L2-L5 levels) were higher in the case group compared to the normal group (P<0.05). The optimal performance in differentiating young CNLBP was the combination of L5 level multifidus T2 value with FF (AUC = 91.81%). Negative correlation existed between T2 values and FF of multifidus at L5 level and JOA scores (r=-0.41, P < 0.05), and positive correlation with VAS scores (r = 0.46, P < 0.05). The combination of T2 value and FF may provide deeper insights into the pathological alterations of paraspinal muscles in young CNLBP, providing an important imaging basis for clinical judgment and preventive treatment of non-painful side in unilateral symptomatic patients.","2024","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society"

The study consecutively recruited patients suspected of having breast cancer from a single center who were prospectively enrolled from July 2023 to May 2024 and underwent [18F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT. This study compared the differences in tracer uptake among breast cancers with different adverse prognostic factors and molecular subtypes. The classification performance for each molecular subtype of breast cancer was assessed using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Fifty-three participants (mean age, 51 ± 11 years; 52 females) were evaluated. Breast cancer lesions with adverse prognostic factors showed higher tracer uptake. The five different molecular subtypes exhibited varying levels of uptake. The luminal A and luminal B (HER2-negative) subtypes had relatively low uptake, while the luminal B (HER2-positive), HER2-positive, and triple-negative subtypes had relatively high uptake. ROC analysis identified the max standardized uptake value (SUVmax) as a significant classifier (AUC = 0.912, P = 0.0005) for the luminal A subtype, with 100% sensitivity and 83% specificity. For predicting the luminal B (HER2-negative) subtype, SUVmax had an AUC of 0.770 (P = 0.0015). SUVmax, with an AUC of 0.781 (P = 0.003), was used to identify the triple-negative subtype tumors, resulting in a sensitivity of 100% and specificity of 51%. Lastly, the ROC curve showed the cut-off 15.40 (AUC = 0.921, P < 0.0001) could classify luminal A & luminal B (HER2-negative), and luminal B (HER2-positive) & HER2-positive & triple-negative, yielding a sensitivity of 94% and specificity of 79%. The uptake of [18F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 is significantly correlated with the molecular subtypes of breast cancer, and [18F]AlF-NOTA-FAPI-04 PET/CT is a potential tool for noninvasive identification of luminal A subtypes and guidance of FAP-targeted therapies.","2024","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging"

Digital whole slide images (WSIs) capture detailed tissue information, but their giga-pixel size necessitates computational methods based on multiple instance learning, which typically analyze small, isolated image tiles without the spatial context of the TME. To address this limitation and incorporate TME spatial histology interactions in predicting NAC response for TNBC patients, we developed a histology context-aware transformer graph convolution network (NACNet). Our deep learning method identifies the histopathological labels on individual image tiles from WSIs, constructs a spatial TME graph, and represents each node with features derived from tissue texture and social network analysis. It predicts NAC response using a transformer graph convolution network model enhanced with graph isomorphism network layers. We evaluate our method with WSIs of a cohort of TNBC patient (N=105) and compared its performance with multiple state-of-the-art machine learning and deep learning models, including both graph and non-graph approaches. Our NACNet achieves 90.0% accuracy, 96.0% sensitivity, 88.0% specificity, and an AUC of 0.82, through eight-fold cross-validation, outperforming baseline models. These comprehensive experimental results suggest that NACNet holds strong potential for stratifying TNBC patients by NAC response, thereby helping to prevent overtreatment, improve patient quality of life, reduce treatment cost, and enhance clinical outcomes, marking an important advancement toward personalized breast cancer treatment.","2024","Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society"

While landslides have been extensively studied, much of the focus has been on developing static frameworks for landslide susceptibility, with relatively little exploration of spatiotemporal modeling. Furthermore, previous studies have often overlooked the spatiotemporal impacts of climate change and dynamic socio-economic factors on landslide susceptibility and risk. This has resulted in a lack of understanding of how landslide risk will evolve in the future. Consequently, this study proposes a modeling approach to simulate the dynamics of landslide susceptibility and exposure population over the next 80 years. The approach involves a series of novel modeling experiments using rainfall-induced landslide data collected over the past decade in Jiangxi Province, using a GAMs that considers the effects of spatial relationships and spatio-temporal cross-validation, with an AUC of 0.885 and an error rate of 15.32%, and combining with the CMIP6 precipitation data to the direct effect of climate change on landslide susceptibility. In addition, a dynamic risk prediction model combining static and dynamic populations was developed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of future landslide impacts. This research framework serves as a scientific foundation and valuable reference for comprehending the effects of climate change on landslide hazards and their management in urban planning and risk mitigation.

To investigate the potential of EEG-guided individualized anesthetic titration we evaluated the effect of the patient's age on the spectral composition of the EEG during slow propofol induction. Twenty-six young (<65 years) and 25 old (≥65 years) patients received propofol until loss of responsiveness (LOR). After LOR, we switched from a flow rate-based to a target-controlled infusion mode keeping the calculated effect-site concentration at LOR stable. We recorded a frontal EEG and calculated the power spectral density (PSD) and the band powers. For the comparison of the spectral composition of old and young patients, we used an effect size, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The older patients received significantly less propofol (p < 0.001). No patient showed a burst suppression pattern. Whereas the absolute power in all frequency bands decreased significantly with the patient's age, the spectral composition did not change throughout the extended induction period. Slow anesthesia induction may be a suitable approach for geriatric patients to preserve spectral composition patterns typically found in younger brains and to individually identify anesthetic requirements reducing the risk of excessive anesthetic effects.","2024","Journal of clinical anesthesia"

Twelve studies evaluating medical complications with 13 ML models reported AUCs ranging from 0.57 to 0.997 and accuracy between 88% and 99.98%. Key predictors included age, hyper-coagulopathy, total number of diagnoses, admission month, and malnutrition. Five studies evaluating orthopedic complications with 10 ML models reported AUCs from 0.49 to 0.93 and accuracy ranging from 92 to 97%, with age, BMI, CCI, AKSS scores, and height identified as key predictors. Ten studies evaluating PROMs comprising of 12 different ML models had an AUC ranging from 0.453 to 0.97 ranked preoperative PROMs as the post-predictive input. Overall, age was the most predictive risk factor for complications post-total joint arthroplasty (TJA). These studies demonstrate the predictive capabilities of these models for anticipating complications and outcomes. Furthermore, these studies also highlight ML models' ability to identify non-classical variables not commonly considered in addition to confirming variables known to be crucial.

Meteorin-like (Metrnl) is a secretory protein that has protective effects on skeletal muscle injury. However, the association of Metrnl level with sarcopenia remains unclear. A total of 772 community-dwelling older adults (median age = 76 years), comprising 409 males and 363 females, from both urban and rural areas were enrolled. Serum Metrnl was measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), grip strength, and gait speed were measured for the assessment of sarcopenia. We found that serum Metrnl levels were lower in patients with sarcopenia [median (IQR) = 180.1 (151.3-220.3) pg/mL] than older adults without sarcopenia [211.9 (163.2-270.0) pg/mL, P < 0.001]. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the optimal cut-off value of serum Metrnl level that predicted sarcopenia was 197.2 pg/mL with a sensitivity of 59.2% and a specificity of 63.8% (AUC = 0.63, 95% CI = 0.59-0.67, P < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analyses showed that lower serum Metrnl level (< 197.2 pg/mL) was significantly associated with increased risk of sarcopenia (adjusted OR = 2.358, 2.36, 95% CI = 1.528-3.685, P < 0.001). Moreover, serum Metrnl concentration was positively correlated with the components of sarcopenia including ASMI (r = 0.135, P < 0.001), grip strength (r = 0.102, P = 0.005), and gait speed (r = 0.106, P = 0.003). Taken together, our findings demonstrate that low serum Metrnl level is correlated with increased risk of sarcopenia in the older adults.","2024","European geriatric medicine"

To investigate the performance of a representation learning-based feature fusion strategy that employs a multiphase contrast-enhanced CT (mpCECT)-based latent feature fusion (MCLFF) model for MTM-HCC identification. A total of 206 patients (54 MTM HCC, 152 non-MTM HCC) who underwent preoperative mpCECT with surgically confirmed HCC between July 2017 and December 2022 were retrospectively included from two medical centers. Multiphasic radiomics features were extracted from manually delineated volume of interest (VOI) of all lesions on each mpCECT phase. Representation learning based MCLFF model was built to fuse multiphasic features for MTM HCC prediction, and compared with competing models using other fusion methods. Conventional imaging features and clinical factors were also evaluated and analyzed. Prediction performance was validated by ROC analysis and statistical comparisons on an internal validation and an external testing dataset. Fusion of radiomics features from the arterial phase (AP) and portal venous phase (PAP) using MCLFF demonstrated superior performance in MTM HCC prediction, with a higher AUC of 0.857 compared with all competing models in the internal validation set. Integration of multiple radiological or clinical features further improved the overall performance, with the highest AUCs of 0.857 and 0.836 respectively achieved in the internal validation and external testing set. Multiphasic radiomics features of AP and PVP fused by the MCLFF have demonstrated substantial potential in the accurate prediction of MTM HCC. Clinical factors and Radiological features in mpCECT contribute incremental values to the developed MCLFF strategy.","2024","Medical physics"

However, there are few works on computationally assisted diagnosis of IBD based on pathological images. Therefore, based on the UK and Chinese IBD diagnostic guidelines, our study established an artificial intelligence-assisted diagnostic system for histologic grading of inflammatory activity in ulcerative colitis (UC). We proposed an efficient deep-learning (DL) method for grading inflammatory activity in whole-slide images (WSIs) of UC pathology. Our model was constructed using 603 UC WSIs from Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital for model train set and internal test set. We collected 212 UC WSIs from Zhujiang Hospital as an external test set. Initially, the pre-trained ResNet50 model on the ImageNet dataset was employed to extract image patch features from UC patients. Subsequently, a multi-instance learning (MIL) approach with embedded self-attention was utilized to aggregate tissue image patch features, representing the entire WSI. Finally, the model was trained based on the aggregated features and WSI annotations provided by senior gastrointestinal pathologists to predict the level of inflammatory activity in UC WSIs. In the task of distinguishing the presence or absence of inflammatory activity, the Area Under Curve (AUC) value in the internal test set is 0.863 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.829, 0.898), with a sensitivity of 0.913 (95% [CI] 0.866, 0.961), and specificity of 0.816 (95% [CI] 0.771, 0.861). The AUC in the external test set is 0.947 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.939, 0.955), with a sensitivity of 0.889 (905% [CI] 0.837, 0.940), and specificity of 0.858 (95% [CI] 0.777, 0.939). For distinguishing different levels of inflammatory activity in UC, the average Macro-AUC in the internal test set and the external test set are 0.827 (95% [CI] 0.803, 0.850) and 0.908 (95% [CI] 0.882, 0.935). the average Micro-AUC in the internal test set and the external test set are 0.816 (95% [CI] 0.792, 0.840) and 0.898 (95% [CI] 0.869, 0.926). Comparative analysis with diagnoses made by pathologists at different expertise levels revealed that the algorithm reached a proficiency comparable to the pathologist with 5 years of experience.

Elderly patients who underwent laparoscopic surgery for gynecologic cancers between 2021 and 2024 were retrospectively enrolled. The primary observational endpoint was set as the occurrence of PONV within 72 h after surgery. Independent risk factors associated with PONV were identified by binary logistic regression, and further incorporated into the nomogram prediction mode by R. Of 337 enrolled patients, 104 experienced PONV with an overall incidence of 30.9%. Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated body mass index (BMI) ≥ 24.0 (OR: 2.67, 95% CI: 1.37-5.23, P = 0.004), Afpel score (OR: 6.54, 95% CI: 3.52-12.15, P < 0.001), anxiety (OR: 3.14, 95% CI: 1.16-8.50, P = 0.025), 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.02-1.07, P < 0.001), prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) (OR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.08, P = 0.007), and albumin/fibrinogen ratio (AFR) (OR: 0.40, 95% CI: 0.28-0.56, P < 0.001) were six independent risk factors for PONV.

In this exploratory study, we used sequential window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra mass spectrometry to identify bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD)-specific changes in protein abundance in plasma samples obtained in the first 72 hours of life from extremely preterm infants and bioinformatic analysis to identify BPD-related biological categories and pathways. Last, binary logistic regression analysis was used to test the BPD predictive potential of a base model alone (gestational age, birth weight, sex) and with the protein biomarker added, with bootstrap resampling used to internally validate protein predictors and adjust for overoptimism. We observed disturbance of key processes, including coagulation, complement activation, development, and extracellular matrix organization, in the first days of life in extremely preterm infants who later received diagnoses of BPD. In the BPD prediction analysis, 49 plasma proteins were identified; when each singularly was combined with birth characteristics the optimism-adjusted C index was 0.65-0.84, suggesting predictive potential for BPD outcomes. Taken together, the results of this study demonstrate that alterations in plasma proteins can be detected from 4 hours of age in extremely preterm infants who later develop BPD and that protein biomarkers, when combined with three birth characteristics, have the potential to predict BPD development within the first 72 hours of life.","2024","American journal of respiratory cell and molecular biology"

Postoperative infections account for a high burden of these complications. This study aimed to assess the predictive value of postoperative C-reactive protein (CRP) levels for overall infectious complications and anastomotic leaks. This was a single-center prospective study of patients undergoing CRS and HIPEC for peritoneal metastases between 2018 and 2020 at Maisonneuve-Rosemont Hospital in Montreal, QC, Canada. CRP levels were measured daily for 10 days following surgery. A comparison was made between patients with infectious complications and those without. Ninety-nine patients were included. Thirty patients had infectious complications (30.3%) and four patients presented an anastomotic leak (4%). CRP levels were significantly higher in patients with infectious complications from postoperative days (PODs) 2-10. Daily cut-off values most accurately predicted infectious complications on day 8 (94.3 mg/L; area under the curve [AUC] 0.85, sensitivity [SE] 76.2%, specificity [SP] 94.7%, positive predictive value [PPV] 88.9%, negative predictive value [NPV] 87.8%; p < 0.0001) and day 9 (72.7 mg/L; AUC 0.89, SE 95.2%, SP 81.8%, PPV 76.9%, NPV 96.4%; p < 0.0001). Patients with infectious complications had longer operative time, higher peritoneal cancer index, and a higher number of intestinal anastomoses, while their baseline characteristics were comparable. Measurement of CRP helps predict infectious complications following CRS and HIPEC, particularly on PODs 8 and 9. Cut-off values are more accurate after the first postoperative week, especially in ruling out infectious complications.","2024","Annals of surgical oncology"

Our study utilized structured electronic health records (EHR) data from the All of Us Research Program. Machine learning models (LightGBM) were utilized to capture the relations between stroke risks and the predictors used by the widely recognized CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores. We mitigated the racial disparity by creating a representative tuning set, customizing tuning criteria, and setting binary thresholds separately for subgroups. We constructed a hold-out test set that not only supports temporal validation but also includes a larger proportion of Black/African Americans for fairness validation. Compared to the original CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc scores, significant improvements were achieved by modeling their predictors using machine learning models (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve from near 0.70 to above 0.80). Furthermore, applying our disparity mitigation strategies can effectively enhance model fairness compared to the conventional cross-validation approach. Modeling CHADS2 and CHA2DS2-VASc risk factors with LightGBM and our disparity mitigation strategies achieved decent discriminative performance and excellent fairness performance. In addition, this approach can provide a complete interpretation of each predictor. These highlight its potential utility in clinical practice. Our research presents a practical example of addressing clinical challenges through the All of Us Research Program data. The disparity mitigation framework we proposed is adaptable across various models and data modalities, demonstrating broad potential in clinical informatics.","2024","Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA"

This observational study included 369 patients with blunt thoracic trauma who underwent surgery for pelvic and upper or lower extremity fractures. Lung ultrasonography was performed pre- and postoperatively. Patients were followed up for 1 week to assess PPCs and assigned to the PPC or non-PPC groups. We identified risk factors for PPCs using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The predictive value of these risk factors was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. PPCs incidence was 36.58 %. The two groups differed significantly in Injury Severity Scores, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, hydrothorax, preoperative hypoxemia, lung ultrasound score, preoperative hemoglobin level, intraoperative infusion volume, and Assess Respiratory Risk in Surgical Patients in Catalonia (ARISCAT) scores (P < 0.05). Independent risk factors for PPCs included ASA classification III, higher postoperative lung ultrasound scores, preoperative anemia, higher intraoperative infusion volume, and higher ARISCAT scores.

This study aims to investigate the minimal clinical important difference (MCID) for the 100 mL water swallow test (100 mL WST) to increase its utility in clinical practice and in clinical trials. Data from 211 HNC patients, treated by either single or combined modality were included. Patients completed both the 100 mL WST and M.D. Anderson Dysphagia Inventory (MDADI) at baseline (i.e., prior to treatment) and 12 months post-treatment. The MCID for the 100 mL WST was calculated using two approaches of the anchor-based method (using the MDADI), including mean change, and ROC curve. Additionally, the distribution-based method was used utilizing the half standard deviation approach. In the anchor-based method, a 4 mL/s in the 100 mL WST was defined as an MCID for deterioration, with a sensitivity of 75% and a 1-specificity of 46%. In contrast, a change of 5 mL/s was deemed as an MCID for improvement, based on the distribution-based method. The findings showed that deterioration of 4 mL, or an increase of 5 mL from baseline to 12 months post-HNC treatment equates to an MCID from the patients' perspective. Based on these findings, it may be beneficial to increase the utilization of the 100 mL WST in clinical practice to observe the changes, and in clinical trials to interpret and compare different study arms.","2024","Head & neck"

Retrospective. 219 patients aged from 15 to 79 years were enrolled. 3.0 or 1.5T, axial fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging (FS-T2WI), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and contrast enhanced T1-weighted imaging (CE-T1WI). MRI features were extracted from the four axial sequences and six different volumes of interest (VOIs) (WTV and WTV + PTV (WPTV)) with different peritumor sizes (PS) ranging from 1 to 5 mm. Those features underwent preprocessing, and the most informative features were selected using minimum redundancy maximum relevance and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator to construct the RS. The optimal RS, with the highest area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic was then integrated with independent clinical characteristics through multivariable logistic regression to construct the radiomics-clinical model (RCM). Mann-Whitney U test, chi-squared test, DeLong test, log-rank test. P < 0.05 indicated a significant difference. All the RSs constructed on WPTV exhibited higher AUCs (0.720-0.756) than WTV (0.671).

Currently, there is limited data concerning the correlation between muscle health and recovery among patients undergoing ASD surgery. To determine the relationship between normalized total psoas area (NTPA), postoperative mobility and adverse events (AEs) among patients undergoing ASD surgery. Retrospective cohort study PATIENT SAMPLE: A retrospective analysis was performed at a single institution between January 2014 and December 2023 of patients undergoing ASD surgery by 10 board certified fellowship-trained orthopaedic spine surgeons. Primary outcome measures were postoperative ambulation distance on postoperative day (POD) 1, 2, 3, and 4 as well as perioperative adverse events including postoperative anemia requiring transfusion, ileus, urinary retention wound complication including dehiscence and infection, delirium, atelectasis, urinary tract infection (UTI), deep vein thrombosis (DVT), and epidural hematoma. Secondary outcome measures were 30-day reoperation rates, 30-day readmission rates, and postoperative length of stay (LOS). Patients that underwent ASD surgery at a single center (2014-2023) were included in the study. NTPA was analyzed at the L3 and L4 mid-vertebral body on preoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine gender-specific NTPA cut-off values for predicting perioperative AEs. Patients were categorized as having a low NTPA if both L3 and L4 NTPA were below the cut-off values. Multivariate logistic regression was conducted to identify confounding predictors of perioperative AEs. 279 patients (102 males, 177 females, mean age 61.2±15.2 years) were included. ROC curve analysis demonstrated L3 NTPA <805 mm2/m2 for males and <505 mm2/m2 for females and L4 NTPA <912 mm2/m2 for males and <714 mm2/m2 for females as cut-off values predicting perioperative AEs. 103 patients (36.9%, 42 males, 61 females) were below these cut-off values and were in the low NTPA cohort. The remaining 176 patients (63.1%, 60 males, 116 females) were in the normal NTPA cohort. The low NTPA group had a higher overall perioperative AEs (70.9% vs 39.2%, p<.001), and lower ambulation distances on postoperative day 1 and 2 compared to the normal NTPA group (p=.021, p=.028, respectively). On multivariate analysis, there were no other predictors of perioperative AEs. Low L3 and L4 NTPA is associated with lower early postoperative mobility and higher rates of perioperative AEs among patients undergoing ASD surgery. These findings stress the importance of muscle health in recovery after ASD surgery.","2024","The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society"
