rayyan-437813830,A novel scoring system to predict short-term mortality after living donor liver transplantation for acute liver failure.,,1,1,American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons,,,,,,,,,,"Liver transplantation is often the only lifesaving option for acute liver failure (ALF); however, the predictors of short-term mortality (death within one year) after living donor liver transplantation (LDLT) for ALF have yet to be defined. We retrospectively collected patients â‰¥18 years old who underwent LDLT for ALF between 2010 and 2020 at 35 centers in Asia. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the clinical variables related to short-term mortality and establish a novel scoring system. The Kaplan-Meier method was performed to explore the association between the score and overall survival. Of the 339 recipients, 46 (13.6%) died within 1 year after LDLT. Multivariate analyses revealed 4 independent risk factors for death: use of vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, the higher model for end-stage liver disease score, and a lower graft-to-recipient weight ratio. The internally validated c-statistic of the short-term mortality after transplant (SMT) score derived from these 4 variables was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.74-0.87). The SMT score successfully stratified recipients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with 1-year overall survival rates of 96%, 80%, and 50%, respectively. In conclusion, our novel SMT score based on 4 predictors will guide ALF recipient and living donor selection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ajt.2024.04.016,,,

Changes inDNA methylation are being increasingly recognized as a crucial factor in predicting cancer progression. Within this research, we developed machine learning and deep learning models for distinguishing distant metastasis in samples of stomach adenocarcinoma based on DNA methylation profile. Employing deep neural networks (DNN), support vector machines (SVM), random forest (RF), Naive Bayes (NB) and decision tree (DT), and models for forecasting distant metastasis in stomach adenocarcinoma. The results show that the performance of DNN is better than that of other models, AUC and AUPR achieving 99.9Â % and 99.5Â % respectively. Additionally, a weighted random sampling technique was utilized to address the issue of imbalanced datasets, enabling the identification of crucial methylation markers associated with functionally significant genes in stomach distant metastasis tumors with greater performance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.compbiomed.2024.108496,,,
rayyan-437813832,Diagnostic accuracy of circulating miRNAs to discriminate hepatocellular carcinoma from liver cirrhosis: a systematic review and meta-analysis.,,1,1,Frontiers in medicine,,,,,,,,,,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and liver cirrhosis (LC) stand as the primary causes of global mortality. Given their profound impact, the development of highly sensitive and specific circulating diagnostic markers becomes imperative to effectively identify and differentiate between cirrhosis and HCC. Accurate diagnosis is paramount in guiding appropriate therapeutic interventions. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) in discerning between HCC and LC. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, with the protocol officially registered on PROSPERO under the reference number CRD42023417494. A thorough search across multiple databases like PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Wiley Online Library, and Science Direct was conducted to identify relevant studies published from January 1, 2018, to August 10, 2023. The included studies underwent methodological quality assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QADAS-2) tool. The synthesis of pooled sensitivity, specificity, and other relevant diagnostic parameters employed a random-effects model and was conducted using Stata 14.0. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and Cochrane Q, with subsequent subgroup analysis and meta-regression performed to identify potential sources of observed heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the resilience of the findings. Furthermore, Deeks' funnel plot was employed to evaluate publication bias. In this meta-analysis, we included fifteen publications, encompassing 787 HCC patients and 784 LC patients. The combined sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) values of miRNAs in differentiating HCC from LC were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78-0.88), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.84), 3.9 (95% CI: 3.0-5.2), 0.21 (95% CI: 0.14-0.29), 19.44 (95% CI: 11-34), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85-0.91), respectively. The results of the subgroup analysis revealed that upregulated miRNA levels and miRNA assessments specifically for individuals of European descent exhibited superior diagnostic performance. The results of this study suggested that circulating miRNAs, especially those that are upregulated, have the potential to function as robust and promising biomarkers in the differentiation of HCC from LC. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42023475954.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Excluded""}",10.3389/fmed.2024.1359414,,,
rayyan-437813833,Elevated Leukocyte Glucose Index Is Associated with Long-Term Arteriovenous Fistula Failure in Dialysis Patients.,,1,1,Journal of clinical medicine,,,,,,,,,,"(1) Background: Arteriovenous fistula (AVF) is the preferred type of vascular access for dialysis in patients with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD). However, the primary patency of AVF at one year is under 70% due to several risk factors and comorbidities. Leukocyte glucose index (LGI), a new biomarker based on blood leukocytes and glucose values, has been found to be associated with poor outcomes in cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of LGI on the long-term primary patency of AVF following dialysis initiation. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in which we initially enrolled 158 patients with ESKD admitted to the Vascular Surgery Department of the Emergency County Hospital of Targu Mures, Romania, to surgically create an AVF for dialysis between January 2020 and July 2023. The primary endpoint was AVF failure, defined as the impossibility of performing a chronic dialysis session due to severe restenosis or AVF thrombosis. After follow-up, we categorized patients into two groups based on their AVF status: ""functional AVF"" for those with a permeable AVF and ""AVF failure"" for those with vascular access dysfunction. (3) Results: Patients with AVF failure had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.013) and diabetes (p = 0.028), as well as a higher LGI value (1.12 vs. 0.79, p < 0.001). At ROC analysis, LGI had the strongest association with the outcome, with an AUC of 0.729, and an optimal cut-off value of 0.95 (72.4% sensitivity and 68% specificity). In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, patients in the highest tertile (T3) of LGI had a significantly higher incidence of AVF failure compared to those in tertile 1 (p = 0.019). Moreover, we found that patients with higher baseline LGI values had a significantly higher risk of AVF failure during follow-up (HR: 1.48, p = 0.003). The association is independent of age and sex (HR: 1.65, p = 0.001), cardiovascular risk factors (HR: 1.63, p = 0.012), and pre-operative vascular mapping determinations (HR: 3.49, p = 0.037). (4) Conclusions: In conclusion, high preoperative values of LGI are positively associated with long-term AVF failure. The prognostic role of the biomarker was independent of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and pre-operative vascular mapping determinations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.3390/jcm13072037,,,
rayyan-437813834,Low platelet count at diagnosis of anti-neutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis is correlated with the severity of disease and renal prognosis.,,1,1,Clinical and experimental medicine,,,,,,,,,,"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody-associated vasculitis (AAV) is an autoimmune disease that involves inflammation of blood vessels. There is increasing evidence that platelets play a crucial role not only in hemostasis but also in inflammation and innate immunity. In this study, we explored the relationship between platelet count, clinical characteristics, and the prognosis of patients with AAV. We divided 187 patients into two groups based on their platelet count. Clinicopathological data and prognostic information were retrospectively gathered from medical records. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for prognosis, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality. The cutoff point for platelet count was set at 264.5â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L, as determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for predicting progression to ESRD in patients with AAV. We observed patients with low platelet count (plateletsâ€‰<â€‰264.5â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L) had lower leukocytes, hemoglobin, complement, acute reactants, and worse renal function (P for eGFRâ€‰<â€‰0.001). They were also more likely to progress to ESRD or death compared to the high platelet count group (plateletsâ€‰>â€‰264.5â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L) (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.0001, Pâ€‰=â€‰0.0338, respectively). Low platelet count was potentially an independent predictor of poor renal prognosis in the multivariate regression analysis [HR 1.670 (95% CI 1.019-2.515), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.014]. Lower platelet count at diagnosis is associated with more severe clinical characteristics and impaired renal function. Therefore, platelet count may be an accessible prognostic indicator for renal outcomes in patients with AAV.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1007/s10238-024-01333-z,,,

However, its role in predicting early mortality in pulmonary embolism (PE) remains unexplored. This observational, prospective, single-center study enrolled consecutive patients aged 18 or older with confirmed acute symptomatic PE and no prior anticoagulation. The study aims to assess the prognostic capacity of sP-selectin measured at the time of PE diagnosis for short-term mortality and major bleeding. A total of 196 patients, with a mean age of 69.1â€‰years (SD 17), were included, of whom 52.6% were male. Within 30â€‰days, 9.7% of patients (nâ€‰=â€‰19) died, and 5.1% (nâ€‰=â€‰10) suffered major bleeding. PE risk stratification revealed 4.6% (nâ€‰=â€‰9) with high-risk PE, 34.7% (nâ€‰=â€‰68) with intermediate-high-risk PE, 38.3% (nâ€‰=â€‰75) with intermediate-low-risk PE, and 22.5% (nâ€‰=â€‰44) with low-risk PE according to the European Society of Cardiology score. Mean plasma sP-selectin levels were comparable between survivors and non-survivors (489.7â€‰ng/mL Â±63 vs. 497.3â€‰ng/mL Â±51; pâ€‰=â€‰.9). The ROC curve for 30-day all-cause mortality and major bleeding yielded an AUC of 0.49 (95% CI 0.36-0.63) and 0.46 (95% CI 0.24-0.68), respectively. Multivariate and survival analyses were precluded due to lack of significance. sP-selectin was not useful for predicting short-term mortality or major bleeding in patients with acute symptomatic pulmonary embolism. Further studies are required to clarify the role of sP-selectin in VTE, particularly in prognosticating PE outcomes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1111/ejh.14218,,,

Data from 110 patients who underwent CPA tumor resection with intraoperative FCoMEPs and BR monitoring were retrospectively reviewed. The association between the amplitude reduction ratios of FCoMEPs and BR at the end of surgery and postoperative facial nerve function was determined. Subsequently, the optimal threshold of FCoMEPs and BR for predicting postoperative facial nerve dysfunction were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Valid BR was record in 103 of 110 patients, whereas only 43 patients successfully recorded FCoMEP in orbicularis oculi muscle. A reduction over 50.3% in FCoMEP (O. oris) amplitude was identified as a predictor of postoperative facial nerve dysfunction (sensitivity, 77.1%; specificity, 83.6%). BR was another independent predictor of postoperative facial nerve deficit with excellent predictive performance, especially eyelid closure function. Its optimal cut-off value for predicting long-term postoperative eyelid closure dysfunction was was 51.0% (sensitivity, 94.4%; specificity, 94.4%). BR can compensate for the deficiencies of the FCoMEPs. The combination of BR and FCoMEPs can be used in CPA tumor surgery. The study first proposed an optimal cut-off value of BR amplitude deterioration (50.0%) for predicting postoperative eyelid closure deficits in patients undergoing CPA tumor surgery.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.clinph.2024.03.033,,,

The secondary aim is to determine the threshold MOCART score which predicts the ability to meet the PASS and the MCID for KOOS QoL. Patients undergoing ACI for grade IV patellofemoral chondral defects by a single surgeon from 2017 to 2020 were identified by search of the EMR. To determine PASS status, patients were asked, ""Do you consider your current level of symptoms to be acceptable?"" KOOS QoL scores were also collected. Patients with 6-month postoperative knee MRI, PASS scores, and minimum 2-year follow-up data were included. Paired t tests and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests were used to evaluate the relationship between MOCART scores and (1) PASS achievement and (2) achievement of the MCID for KOOS QoL (12.8). Thirty-four patients were included, with a median age of 35.1 years [IQR: 24.6, 37.1], and BMI of 24.0 kg/m2 [IQR: 21.5, 28.1]. The median time to postoperative MRI was 6.7 months [IQR: 5.8, 7.9], and average follow-up time was 3.7 Â± 1.2 years. Twenty-five patients (74%) achieved PASS, and 18 patients (out of 27 who had postop KOOS QoL Scores, 67%) achieved the MCID for KOOS QoL. Patients who achieved PASS had higher average MOCART scores (61.8 Â± 16.0) than those who did not achieve PASS (45.0 Â± 12.8, p=0.011), whereas patients who achieved the MCID for KOOS QoL did not have higher MOCART scores than those who did not achieve the MCID (61.9 Â± 18.3 versus 53.3 Â± 17.1, P = 0.25). There was no relationship between age, sex, lesion size, and lesion location and ability to achieve PASS or MCID for KOOS QoL (p>0.05). A threshold MOCART value of 55 was associated with the highest AUC on ROC analysis for likelihood of achieving PASS (0.778) and MCID for KOOS QoL (0.667). Higher MOCART scores are associated with an increased likelihood of achieving PASS following patellofemoral ACI. Moreover, MOCART scores > 55 predict the ability to achieve PASS and the MCID for KOOS QoL following patellofemoral ACI.

rayyan-437813839,Pancreatic mucinous adenocarcinoma has different clinical characteristics and better prognosis compared to non-specific PDAC: A retrospective observational study.,,1,1,Heliyon,,,,,,,,,,"Pancreatic mucinous adenocarcinoma (PMAC) is a rare malignant tumour, and there is limited understanding of its epidemiology and prognosis. Initially, PMAC was considered a metastatic manifestation of other cancers; however, instances of non-metastatic PMAC have been documented through monitoring, epidemiological studies, and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of PMAC and discern the prognostic differences between PMAC and the more prevalent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The study used data from the SEER database from 2000 to 2018 to identify patients diagnosed with PMAC or PDAC. To ensure comparable demographic characteristics between PDAC and PMAC, propensity score matching was employed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyse overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine independent risk factors influencing OS and CSS. Additionally, the construction and validation of risk-scoring models for OS and CSS were achieved through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-Cox regression technique. The SEER database included 84,857 patients with PDAC and 3345 patients with PMAC. Notably, significant distinctions were observed in the distribution of tumour sites, diagnosis time, use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, tumour size, grading, and staging between the two groups. The prognosis exhibited notable improvement among married individuals, those receiving acceptable chemotherapy, and those with focal PMAC (pÂ <Â 0.05). Conversely, patients with elevated log odds of positive lymph node scores or higher pathological grades in the pancreatic tail exhibited a more unfavourable prognosis (pÂ <Â 0.05). The risk-scoring models for OS or CSS based on prognostic factors indicated a significantly lower prognosis for high-risk patients compared to their low-risk counterparts (area under the curve OS: 0.81-0.82, CSS: 0.80-0.82). PMAC exhibits distinct clinical characteristics compared to non-specific PDAC. Leveraging these features and pathological classifications allows for accurate prognostication of PMAC or PDAC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30268,,,

However, LVA and LA volume are good predictors of arrhythmia recurrence in ablation-naÃ¯ve patients. Their predictive value in progressively diseased pre-ablated atria is uncertain. Consecutive patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial tachycardia (AT), who were scheduled for repeat LA ablation, were enrolled in the prospective Bernau ablation registry between 2016 and 2020. All patients received a complete LA ultrahigh-density map before ablation. Maps were analyzed for LA size, LVA percentage and distribution. The predictive value of demographic, anatomic, and mapping variables on AF recurrence was analyzed. 160 patients (50.6% male, 1.3 pre-ablations, 60% persistent AF) with complete LA voltage maps were included. Mean follow-up time was 16â€‰Â±â€‰11 months. Mean recorded electrograms (EGMs) per map were 9754â€‰Â±â€‰5808, mean LA volume was 176.1â€‰Â±â€‰35.9â€‰ml and mean rate of LVAs <0.5â€‰mV was 30.6%â€‰Â±â€‰23.1%.

rayyan-437813841,The triglyceride-glucose index is superior to homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance in predicting metabolic syndrome in an adult population in the United States.,,1,1,Journal of clinical lipidology,,,,,,,,,,"Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of cardio-metabolic features portending an increased risk for both type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and premature atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is a widely used surrogate measure of insulin resistance. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is another validated measure of insulin resistance that predicts both diabetes and cardiovascular disease in low and medium-income countries, but only diabetes in high income countries. Due to the paucity of data on the TyG index in the US population, we compared the validity of the TyG index and HOMA-IR in predicting MetS. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2005 and 2018 on Non-Hispanic White (NHW), Hispanic American (HA), and African American (AA) individuals (n = 5380) aged 20-80 years were used for analysis. Individuals were classified as having MetS based on three or more of its components. HOMA-IR and the TyG index were determined from fasting samples. Both the TyG index and HOMA-IR were significantly increased in MetS and increased significantly with increasing severity of the syndrome. Also both indices correlated significantly with all 5 features of MetS, hsCRP and non-HDL-C. ROC-AUC analysis for TyG index was significantly greater than that of HOMA-IR in predicting MetS: 0.87 (95 % CI 0.85-0.88) versus 0.82 (95 % CI 0.81-0.83) respectively, p < 0.0001. This was not evident for the small AA subgroup. The TyG index outperformed HOMA-IR in predicting MetS, a proxy for both T2DM and ASCVD, in a general US population and is a valuable biomarker.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.jacl.2024.04.130,,,

Low-risk is defined as grade I or II DCIS. Because DCIS grade is a major eligibility criteria in these trials, it would be very helpful to assess DCIS grade on mammography, informed by grade assessed on DCIS histopathology in pre-surgery biopsies, since surgery will not be performed on a significant number of patients participating in these trials. To assess the performance and clinical utility of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in discriminating high-risk (grade III) DCIS and/or Invasive Breast Cancer (IBC) from low-risk (grade I/II) DCIS based on mammographic features. We explored whether the CNN could be used as a decision support tool, from excluding high-risk patients for active surveillance. In this single centre retrospective study, 464 patients diagnosed with DCIS based on pre-surgery biopsy between 2000 and 2014 were included. The collection of mammography images was partitioned on a patient-level into two subsets, one for training containing 80% of cases (371 cases, 681 images) and 20% (93 cases, 173 images) for testing. A deep learning model based on the U-Net CNN was trained and validated on 681 two-dimensional mammograms. Classification performance was assessed with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristic and predictive values on the test set for predicting high risk DCIS-and high-risk DCIS and/ or IBC from low-risk DCIS. When classifying DCIS as high-risk, the deep learning network achieved a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 0.40, Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 0.91 and an AUC of 0.72 on the test dataset. For distinguishing high-risk and/or upstaged DCIS (occult invasive breast cancer) from low-risk DCIS a PPV of 0.80, a NPV of 0.84 and an AUC of 0.76 were achieved. For both scenarios (DCIS grade I/II vs. III, DCIS grade I/II vs. III and/or IBC) AUCs were high, 0.72 and 0.76, respectively, concluding that our convolutional neural network can discriminate low-grade from high-grade DCIS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1186/s40644-024-00691-x,,,

This retrospective observational study was conducted in 2,857 and 4,184 hospitals in urban and regional cities in 47 provinces of Japan, respectively, between January 2020 and August 2023. Tokyo and ordinance-designated cities in provinces were defined as urban cities, and those without such cities were defined as regional cities. The primary endpoint was the presence or absence of a stroke care unit. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the presence of stroke care units was significantly associated with the number of neurosurgical specialists. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to predict the number of personnel required for stroke care unit installation based on the number of neurosurgical specialists. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Youden index, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.721, 0.483, 0.783, and 0.700, respectively. Our study underscores the indispensability of SCUs in stroke treatment, advocating for a strategic allocation of medical resources, heightened accessibility to neurosurgical specialists, and a concerted effort to address geographic and resource imbalances. The identified cutoff value of 8.99 neurosurgical specialists per 100,000 population serves as a practical benchmark for optimizing SCU establishment, thereby potentially mitigating stroke-related mortality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.jstrokecerebrovasdis.2024.107734,,,

However, no evidence-based predictive tool has been developed specifically to assess the occurrence of subsyndromal delirium in the ICU. To develop and validate a novel, simple and effective tool for estimating the risk of subsyndromal delirium among ICU patients. A prospective, nested case-controlled study. A total of 731 patients were recruited from the central ICU of a tertiary hospital in southwestern China from August 2021 to November 2022. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator was applied to screen potential features for univariate and multivariate logistic regression. A nomogram was constructed using the selected variables. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by combining the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). The prevalence of subsyndromal delirium among ICU patients was 23.06â€¯%. Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that the independent predictive factors for subsyndromal delirium among ICU patients were vision impairment, a history of falls, the use of restraint, blood transfusion, the use of antibiotics, surgery, the Caprini score, and the Braden score, all of which were used to construct the nomogram. The AUCs for the model were 0.710 (95â€¯% CI, 0.654-0.766, Pâ€¯<â€¯0.001) and 0.825 (95â€¯% CI, 0.732-0.917, Pâ€¯<â€¯0.001) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively, indicating that the model had high accuracy in distinguishing patients with and without subsyndromal delirium. The calibration curve of the nomogram showed good consistency between the predicted and actual probabilities. The DCA indicated that the nomogram has clinical application for patients in the ICU. We developed an easy-to-use nomogram for identifying subsyndromal delirium in ICU patients with satisfactory predictive ability based on simple and easily accessible clinical features. The nomogram can identify ICU patients at high-risk for subsyndromal delirium and may be a useful subsyndromal delirium tool for current ICU physicians.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2024.104767,,,

To determine whether PROMs, as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), would change significantly after 2-months postoperatively after lumbar decompression surgery for disc herniation or spinal stenosis. Retrospective analysis of prospectively and consecutively enrolled patients undergoing lumbar decompression surgery between 2020 and 2021 from a single surgeon spine registry. One hundred sixty-nine patients. ODI, achievement of minimum clinically important difference (MCID), revisions. Patients without a preoperative baseline score were excluded. Completion of the ODI questionnaire was assessed at the follow-up points. The median ODI was compared at time baseline, 2-month, 1-year and 2-year follow-up. Risk of reoperation was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify at-risk ODI thresholds of requiring reoperation. Median ODI significantly improved at all time points compared to baseline (median baseline ODI: 40; 2-month ODI: 16, p=.001; 1-year ODI: 11.1, p=.001; 2-year ODI: 8, p=.001).

However, the current availability of non-invasive biomarkers for NAFLD remains limited. Therefore, further investigation is needed to identify and develop non-invasive biomarkers for NAFLD. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 11,883 patients admitted to the Healthcare Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, from January 2016 to December 2019 and divided into NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups. Anthropometric and laboratory examination data were collected. The correlations between variables and NAFLD were evaluated using the student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test and binary logistic regression analysis. The predictive ability of these variables for NAFLD was assessed using the areas under the curves (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristics. Among the included patients, 3,872 (32.58%) were diagnosed with NAFLD, with 386 (9.97%) individuals having liver fibrosis. Patients with NAFLD exhibited a higher proportion of males, elevated body mass index (BMI), and increased likelihood of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis.

The combination of photoacoustic (PA) imaging and radiomics unveils functional insights and intricate details that are imperceptible to the naked eye. This study aims to assess the efficacy of PA imaging in breast cancer radiomics, focusing on the impact of peritumoral region size on radiomic model accuracy. From January 2022 to November 2023, data were collected from 358 patients with breast nodules, diagnosed via PA/US examination and classified as BI-RADS 3-5. The study used the largest lesion dimension in PA images to define the region of interest, expanded by 2â€¯mm, 5â€¯mm, and 8â€¯mm, for extracting radiomic features. Techniques from statistics and machine learning were applied for feature selection, and logistic regression classifiers were used to build radiomic models. These models integrated both intratumoral and peritumoral data, with logistic regressions identifying key predictive features. The developed nomogram, combining 5â€¯mm peritumoral data with intratumoral and clinical features, showed superior diagnostic performance, achieving an AUC of 0.950 in the training cohort and 0.899 in validation. This model outperformed those based solely on clinical features or other radiomic methods, with the 5â€¯mm peritumoral region proving most effective in identifying malignant nodules. This research demonstrates the significant potential of PA imaging in breast cancer radiomics, especially the advantage of integrating 5â€¯mm peritumoral with intratumoral features.

First, the placentas on T2WI were manually annotated, and a deep learning model was developed to automatically segment the placentas. Then, the radiomic features were extracted from the placentas and selected by three-step feature selection. In addition, fetus-based measurement features and mother-based clinical features were obtained from ultrasound examinations and medical records, respectively. Finally, a hybrid model based on random forest was constructed by fusing these features, and further compared with models based on other machine learning methods and different feature combinations. The performances of placenta segmentation and FGR assessment were evaluated by Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), respectively. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The placentas were automatically segmented with an average DSC of 90.0%. The hybrid model achieved an AUROC of 0.923, 0.931, and 0.880 on the internal test, time-independent validation, and external validation sets, respectively. The mother-based clinical features resulted in significant performance improvements for FGR assessment. The proposed hybrid model may be able to assess FGR with high accuracy. Furthermore, information complementation based on placental, fetal, and maternal features could also lead to better FGR assessment performance. Stage 2.",,10.1002/jmri.29399,,,

Despite its infrequent adverse effects within therapeutic range, prolonged VPA usage may result in metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. These metabolic dysregulations in childhood are notably linked to heightened cardiovascular risk in adulthood. Therefore, identification and effective management of dyslipidemia in children hold paramount significance. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we explored the potential associations between physiological factors, medication situation, biochemical parameters before the first dose of VPA (baseline) and VPA-induced dyslipidemia (VID) in pediatric patients. Binary logistic regression was utilized to construct a predictive model for blood lipid disorders, aiming to identify independent pre-treatment risk factors. Additionally, The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the performance of the model. Results: Through binary logistic regression analysis, we identified for the first time that direct bilirubin (DBIL) (odds ratios (OR) = 0.511, p = 0.01), duration of medication (OR = 0.357, p = 0.009), serum albumin (ALB) (OR = 0.913, p = 0.043), BMI (OR = 1.140, p = 0.045), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (OR = 1.038, p = 0.026) at baseline were independent risk factors for VID in pediatric patients with epilepsy. Notably, the predictive ability of DBIL (AUC = 0.690, p < 0.0001) surpassed that of other individual factors. Furthermore, when combined into a predictive model, incorporating all five risk factors, the predictive capacity significantly increased (AUC = 0.777, p < 0.0001), enabling the forecast of 77.7% of dyslipidemia events. Conclusion: DBIL emerges as the most potent predictor, and in conjunction with the other four factors, can effectively forecast VID in pediatric patients with epilepsy. This insight can guide the formulation of individualized strategies for the clinical administration of VPA in children.",,10.3389/fphar.2024.1349043,,,

The data were obtained from 1663 children and adolescents aged 10-19 years (771 girls) who participated in the Fourth and Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHtR) were included as obesity measures. Fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and resting blood pressure were included as metabolic risk factors. MetS was defined as the clustering of metabolic risk factors such as elevated fasting blood glucose, elevated mean arterial pressure, elevated triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Regardless of the obesity measures used, obese children and adolescents were more likely to have a clustering of metabolic risk factors compared to their non-obese counterparts: BMI-based obesity (odds ratio, OR=4.151, 95% confidence interval, CI=2.763~6.238, p<0.001), WC-based obesity (OR=1.917, 95% CI=1.066~3.446, p=0.010), and WHtR-based obesity (OR=2.160 and 95% CI=1.203~3.878, p=0.003). A receiver operating curve analysis showed that BMI (area under the curve, AUC=0.849, 95% CI=0.8270.871) outperformed WC (AUC=0.833, 95% CI=0.8090.856) and WHtR (AUC=0.794, 95% CI=0.7670.821) in detecting the presence of MetS. Study findings suggest that obese teenagers are more likely to have metabolic syndrome than non-obese teens. Concerning accuracy, convenience, and ease of use and calculation, BMI is the best screening tool for detecting MetS in Korean children and adolescents.",,10.2147/JMDH.S461406,,,

However, preoperative imaging is not reliable enough for identifying LNM. To develop and validate a radiomics nomogram based on dynamic contrast enhanced (DCE)-MR images for identifying LNM and prognosis in iCCA. Retrospective. Two hundred four patients with pathologically proven iCCA who underwent curative-intent resection and lymphadenectomy (training cohort: Nâ€‰=â€‰107, internal test cohort: Nâ€‰=â€‰46, and external test cohort: Nâ€‰=â€‰51). T1- and T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and DCE imaging at 1.5â€‰T or 3.0â€‰T. Radiomics features were extracted from intra- and peri-tumoral regions on preoperative DCE-MR images. Imaging features were evaluated by three radiologists, and significant variables in univariable and multivariable regression analysis were included in clinical model. The best-performing radiomics signature and clinical characteristics (intrahepatic duct dilatation, MRI-reported LNM) were combined to build a nomogram. Patients were divided into high-risk and low-risk groups based on their nomogram scores (cutoffâ€‰=â€‰0.341). Patients were followed up for 1-102â€‰months (median 12) after surgery, the overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS) were calculated. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration, decision curve, Delong test, Kaplan-Meier curves, log rank test. Two tailed Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05 was considered statistically significant. The nomogram incorporating intra- and peri-tumoral radiomics features, intrahepatic duct dilatation and MRI-reported LNM obtained the best discrimination for LNM, with areas under the ROC curves of 0.946, 0.913, and 0.859 in the training, internal, and external test cohorts. In the entire cohort, high-risk patients had significantly lower RFS and OS than low-risk patients. High-risk of LNM was an independent factor of unfavorable OS and RFS. The nomogram integrating intra- and peri-tumoral radiomics signatures has potential to identify LNM and prognosis in iCCA. 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}",10.1002/jmri.29390,,,

Multi-institutional data (NÂ =Â 58) of PCa patients who underwent pre-treatment 3-T MRI prior to RP were included in this retrospective study. Radiomic and pathomic features were extracted from PCa regions on MRI and RP specimens delineated by expert clinicians. On training set (D1, NÂ =Â 44), Cox Proportional-Hazards models MR, MP and MRaP were trained using radiomics, pathomics, and their combination, respectively, to prognosticate rising PSA (PSA > 0.03Â ng/mL). Top features from MRaP were used to train a model to predict EPE on D1 and test on external dataset (D2, NÂ =Â 14). C-index, Kalplan-Meier curves were used for survival analysis, and area under ROC (AUC) was used for EPE. MRaP was compared with the existing post-treatment risk-calculator, CAPRA (MC). Patients had median follow-up of 34 months.

The complement system participates kidney disease resulting in proteinuria. Whether the ratio of complement and IgG is associated with macroproteinuria remains unknown. A total of 1013 non-dialysis chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients were recruited according to the electrical case records system with 268 patients who endured kidney biopsy. Patients were grouped via the estimated glomerular filtration rate or the levels of proteinuria determination. Biomarkers in different CKD groups or proteinuria groups were compared by one-way ANOVA or independent samples t-test. Pearson or spearman analysis was employed to analyze correlation between clinical indexes. Further, influence factor of macroproteinuria was studied by using binary logistic regression. The ROC curve was performed to explore probable predictive biomarker for macroproteinuria.

Several VTE-specific clinical prediction models (CPMs) have been used to assist physicians in decision-making but have several limitations. This systematic review explores if machine learning (ML) can enhance CPMs by analyzing extensive patient data derived from electronic health records. We aimed to explore ML-CPMs' applications in VTE for risk stratification, outcome prediction, diagnosis, and treatment. â€ƒThree databases were searched: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE electronic library. Inclusion criteria focused on studies using structured data, excluding non-English publications, studies on non-humans, and certain data types such as natural language processing and image processing. Studies involving pregnant women, cancer patients, and children were also excluded. After excluding irrelevant studies, a total of 77 studies were included. â€ƒMost studies report that ML-CPMs outperformed traditional CPMs in terms of receiver operating area under the curve in the four clinical domains that were explored. However, the majority of the studies were retrospective, monocentric, and lacked detailed model architecture description and external validation, which are essential for quality audit. This review identified research gaps and highlighted challenges related to standardized reporting, reproducibility, and model comparison. â€ƒML-CPMs show promise in improving risk assessment and individualized treatment recommendations in VTE. Apparently, there is an urgent need for standardized reporting and methodology for ML models, external validation, prospective and real-world data studies, as well as interventional studies to evaluate the impact of artificial intelligence in VTE.",,10.1055/a-2299-4758,,,

Methods: TGD individuals underwent body composition studies by bioelectrical impedance analysis according to designated sex at birth, and their muscle-to-fat ratio (MFR) z-scores were calculated. Generalized estimating equations with binary logistic models (nâ€‰=â€‰326) were used to explore associations while adjusting for potential confounders. Results: A total of 55 TGD females and 111 TGD males, with mean age of 18â€‰Â±â€‰1.9 years and median duration of GAHT of 1.4 years (interquartile rangeâ€‰=â€‰0.6-2.5), were enrolled. Overall, 118/166 (71%) of the TGD cohort showed evidence of at least one MetS component, with a significantly higher rate among TGD males compared with TGD females (91.1% vs. 50.9%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). TGD males were at increased odds for overweight/obesity, elevated/hypertensive BP, elevated triglycerides (TGs), and an atherogenic dyslipidemia index (TG/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], TG:HDL-c). The odds of overweight/obesity increased by 44.9 for each standard deviation decrease in the MFR z-score, while the odds for an elevated TG:HDL-c index increased by 3.7. Psychiatric morbidity increased the odds for overweight/obesity by 2.89. Conclusions: After considering confounding variables, the TGD males on GAHT were found to be at an increased risk for cardiometabolic disease.

The current study aims to compare indirect radiographic signs of instability in a symptomatic BHD population to those in a healthy cohort. The study group consisted of patients with a lateral centre-edge angle (LCEA) with values 18Â°â€‰â‰¤â€‰LCEAâ€‰<â€‰25Â° who underwent corrective periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) and reported an improvement in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The comparison group consisted of a healthy cohort of athletes who did not complain of any hip-related symptoms and who had normal values of their hip morphological parameters (LCEA, acetabular index (AIÂ°), alpha angle (Î±Â°), femoral version, acetabular version). Indirect signs of instability consisting of the femoro-epiphyseal acetabular roof index (FEAR), iliocapsularis-to-rectus-femoris (IC/RF) ratio and labral dimensions (height-to-length ratio) were assessed in both groups. Partial Pearson correlation, logistic multiple regression analysis and Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to determine correlations, as well as the sensitivity and specificity of these signs to differentiate between healthy hips and BHD. On binary logistic multiple regression analysis, the FEAR Index was the only independent predictor to differentiate between BHD and healthy hips (pâ€‰<â€‰0.001). The IC/RF ratio did not achieve significance. The calculated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.93 (0.87 - 0.99, CI 95%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) for the FEAR Index and 0.81 (0.70 - 0.92, CI 95%, pâ€‰<â€‰0.001) for the height-length ratio.

Twenty women with normal pregnancies (NPs) were recruited as control group, and twenty women each with tubal pregnancy (TP) and cervical pregnancy (CP) were recruited. Blood samples were collected to detect EGF and Î²-HCG. Data on length of hospital stay and incidence of complications were collected. The differences in serum EGF and Î²-HCG levels were compared among groups and within various types of ectopic pregnancy using analysis of variance and Pearson correlation analysis. Serum EGF and Î²-HCG were notably lower in TP and CP group vs. controls (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). In subgroup analysis within the types of ectopic pregnancy, serum EGF levels were drastically higher in TP group vs. CP group (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05). Serum EGF levels were negatively correlated with pregnancy outcomes and incidence of complications (Pâ€‰<â€‰0.05).

Recombinant p24 protein expressed by Escherichia coli, in combination with the monoclonal antibody 2G11 exhibiting exceptional performance, was used for the establishment of the cELISA. Receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the assay were 98.85Â % and 98.13Â %, respectively. Furthermore, the established cELISA was specific for detecting BLV-specific antibodies, without cross-reactivity to antisera for six other bovine viruses. Significantly, experimental infection of cattle and sheep with BLV revealed that the cELISA accurately monitors seroconversion. In a performance evaluation, the established cELISA displayed a high agreement with Western blotting and the commercial BLV gp51 cELISA kit in the detection of 242 clinical samples, respectively. In conclusion, the novel p24 cELISA exhibited the potential to be a reliable and efficient diagnostic tool for BLV serological detection with a broad application prospect.",,10.1016/j.ijbiomac.2024.131446,,,

The main objective of this review was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of CEUS in the diagnosis of malignant subpleural pulmonary consolidations and, therefore, differentiate them from benign ones. Methods: Papers published before December 2023 were detected through a search of PubMed, Cochrane library, and Embase. The pooled specificity and sensitivity, summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) were used. Results: CEUS is characterized by a pooled sensitivity of 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93-0.97) and a pooled specificity of 0.93 (95% CI: 0.90-0.95) in differentiating benign and malignant subpleural lung diseases; the AUC of SROC was 0.97. Homogeneous CE was characterized by a pooled sensitivity of 0.43 (95% CI: 0.40-0.45) and the pooled specificity of 0.49 (95% CI: 0.46-0.52). Non-homogeneous CE displayed a pooled sensitivity of 0.57 (95% CI: 0.55-0.60) and a pooled specificity of 0.51 (95% CI: 0.48-0.54). The lack of CE displayed a pooled sensitivity of 0.01 (95% CI: 0.00-0.06) and a pooled specificity of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.64-0.85). Marked CE displayed a pooled sensitivity of 0.41 (95% CI: 0.37-0.44) and a pooled specificity of 0.54 (95% CI: 0.50-0.58). Non-marked CE displayed a pooled sensitivity of 0.59 (95% CI: 0.56-0.63) and a pooled specificity of 0.46 (95% CI: 0.42-0.50). The early AT displayed a pooled sensitivity of 0.04 (95% CI: 0.02-0.08) and a pooled specificity of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.77-0.87). The early wash out displayed a pooled sensitivity of 0.61 (95% CI: 0.48-0.72) and a pooled specificity of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.92-1.00).

Conclusions: CEUS is characterized by excellent diagnostic accuracy for the diagnosis of the malignancy of subpleural lung lesions. By separately analyzing the CEUS findings, the diagnostic accuracy values are considerably lower and not significant in some cases. The simultaneous evaluation of multiple CEUS features allows us to reach an excellent diagnostic accuracy. Non-homogeneous CE with early wash out are the most indicative features of malignancy of a lung lesion.",,10.3390/jcm13082302,,,

American journal of neuroradiology,,,,,,,,,,"Predicting long-term clinical outcome in acute ischemic stroke is beneficial for prognosis, clinical trial design, resource management, and patient expectations. This study used a deep learning-based predictive model (DLPD) to predict 90-day mRS outcomes and compared its predictions with those made by physicians. A previously developed DLPD that incorporated DWI and clinical data from the acute period was used to predict 90-day mRS outcomes in 80 consecutive patients with acute ischemic stroke from a single-center registry. We assessed the predictions of the model alongside those of 5 physicians (2 stroke neurologists and 3 neuroradiologists provided with the same imaging and clinical information). The primary analysis was the agreement between the ordinal mRS predictions of the model or physician and the ground truth using the Gwet Agreement Coefficient. We also evaluated the ability to identify unfavorable outcomes (mRSâ€‰>2) using the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Noninferiority analyses were undertaken using limits of 0.1 for the Gwet Agreement Coefficient and 0.05 for the area under the curve analysis. The accuracy of prediction was also assessed using the mean absolute error for prediction, percentage of predictions Â±1 categories away from the ground truth (Â±1 accuracy [ACC]), and percentage of exact predictions (ACC). To predict the specific mRS score, the DLPD yielded a Gwet Agreement Coefficient score of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.71-0.86), surpassing the physicians' score of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.67-0.84), and was noninferior to the readers (Pâ€‰<â€‰.001). For identifying unfavorable outcome, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.89), again noninferior to the readers' area under the curve of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69-0.87) (Pâ€‰<â€‰.005). The mean absolute error, Â±1ACC, and ACC were 0.89, 81%, and 36% for the DLPD.

Conventional ultrasound and qualitative CEUS features were analyzed for the PTC with or without CLNM using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A nomogram integrating the predictors was constructed to identify CLNM in PTC. The predictive nomogram was validated using a validation cohort. A total of 684 patients were enrolled. The 495 patients in training cohort were divided into two groups according to whether they had CLNM (pCLNM, n= 191) or not (nCLNM, n= 304). There were significant differences in terms of tumor size, shape, echogenic foci, enhancement direction, peak intensity, and score based on CEUS TI-RADS between the two groups. Independent predictive US features included irregular shape, larger tumor size (â‰¥ 1.0cm), and score. Nomogram integrating these predictive features showed good discrimination and calibration in both training and validation cohort with an AUC of 0.72 (95% CI: 0.68, 0.77) and 0.79 (95% CI: 0.72, 0.85), respectively. In the subgroup with larger tumor size, age â‰¤ 35 years, irregular shape, and score > 6 were independent risk factors for CLNM. The score based on preoperative CEUS features of PTC may help to identify CLNM. The nomogram developed in this study provides a convenient and effective tool for clinicians to determine an optimal treatment regimen for patients with PTC.",,10.3389/fendo.2024.1336787,,,

A combined ultrasound evaluation of the heart, lungs, and diaphragm during the weaning phase can help to identify risk factors and underlying mechanisms for weaning failure. This study aimed to investigate the accuracy of lung ultrasound (LUS), transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and diaphragm ultrasound for predicting weaning failure in critically ill patients. Patients undergoing invasive MV for >â€‰48Â h and who were readied for their first spontaneous breathing trial (SBT) were studied. Patients were scheduled for a 2-h SBT using low-level pressure support ventilation. LUS and TTE were performed prospectively before and 30Â min after starting the SBT, and diaphragm ultrasound was only performed 30Â min after starting the SBT. Weaning failure was defined as failure of SBT, re-intubation, or non-invasive ventilation within 48Â h. Fifty-one patients were included, of whom 15 experienced weaning failure. During the SBT, the global, anterior, and antero-lateral LUS scores were higher in the failed group than in the successful group. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the areas under the curves for diaphragm thickening fraction (DTF) and global and antero-lateral LUS scores during the SBT to predict weaning failure were 0.678, 0.719, and 0.721, respectively. There was no correlation between the LUS scores and the average E/e' ratio during the SBT. Multivariate analysis identified antero-lateral LUS scoreâ€‰>â€‰7 and DTFâ€‰<â€‰31% during the SBT as independent predictors of weaning failure. LUS and diaphragm ultrasound can help to predict weaning failure in patients undergoing an SBT with low-level pressure support. An antero-lateral LUS scoreâ€‰>â€‰7 and DTFâ€‰<â€‰31% during the SBT were associated with weaning failure.",,10.1186/s13613-024-01294-2,,,

The predictive models for solitary HCC could potentially integrate more comprehensive tumor information. Owing to the diverse findings across studies, we aimed to compare radiomic and non-radiomic methods for preoperative MVI detection in solitary HCC. Articles were reviewed from databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library until April 7, 2023. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), and negative likelihood ratio (NLR) were calculated using a random-effects model within a 95% confidence interval (CI). Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using summary receiver-operating characteristic curves and the area under the curve (AUC). Meta-regression and Z-tests identified heterogeneity and compared the predictive accuracy. Subgroup analyses were performed to compare the AUC of two methods according to study type, study design, tumor size, modeling methods, and imaging modality. The analysis incorporated 26 studies involving 3539 patients with solitary HCC. The radiomics models showed a pooled sensitivity and specificity of 0.79 (95%CI: 0.72-0.85)Â and 0.78 (95%CI: 0.73-0.82), with an AUC at 0.85 (95%CI: 0.82-0.88). Conversely, the non-radiomics models had sensitivity and specificity of 0.74 (95%CI: 0.65-0.81)Â and 0.88 (95%CI: 0.82-0.92)Â and an AUC of 0.88 (95%CI: 0.85-0.91). Subgroups with preoperative MRI, larger tumors, and functional imaging had higher accuracy than those using preoperative CT, smaller tumors, and conventional imaging. Non-radiomic methods outperformed radiomic methods, but high heterogeneity calls across studies for cautious interpretation.",,10.1016/j.acra.2024.04.003,,,
rayyan-437813875,Comparison of Volumetric and 2D Measurements and Longitudinal Trajectories in the Response Assessment of BRAF V600E-Mutant Pediatric Gliomas in the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium Clinical Trial.,,1,1,AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology,,,,,,,,,,"Response on imaging is widely used to evaluate treatment efficacy in clinical trials of pediatric gliomas. While conventional criteria rely on 2D measurements, volumetric analysis may provide a more comprehensive response assessment. There is sparse research on the role of volumetrics in pediatric gliomas. Our purpose was to compare 2D and volumetric analysis with the assessment of neuroradiologists using the Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) in BRAF V600E-mutant pediatric gliomas. Manual volumetric segmentations of whole and solid tumors were compared with 2D measurements in 31 participants (292 follow-up studies) in the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium 002 trial (NCT01748149). Two neuroradiologists evaluated responses using BT-RADS. Receiver operating characteristic analysis compared classification performance of 2D and volumetrics for partial response. Agreement between volumetric and 2D mathematically modeled longitudinal trajectories for 25 participants was determined using the model-estimated time to best response. Of 31 participants, 20 had partial responses according to BT-RADS criteria. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the classification of partial responders at the time of first detection (medianâ€‰= 2â€‰months) yielded an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69-0.99) for 2D area, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00) for whole-volume, and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.82-1.00) for solid volume change. There was no significant difference in the area under the curve between 2D and solid (Pâ€‰=â€‰.34) or whole volume (Pâ€‰=â€‰.39). There was no significant correlation in model-estimated time to best response (Ï = 0.39, P >.05) between 2D and whole-volume trajectories. Eight of the 25 participants had a difference of â‰¥90â€‰days in transition from partial response to stable disease between their 2D and whole-volume modeled trajectories. Although there was no overall difference between volumetrics and 2D in classifying partial response assessment using BT-RADS, further prospective studies will be critical to elucidate how the observed differences in tumor 2D and volumetric trajectories affect clinical decision-making and outcomes in some individuals.",,10.3174/ajnr.A8189,,,

Ancillary signs like joint effusion or lipo-hemarthrosis are indicative of fractures, suggesting the need for further imaging. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can automate image analysis, improving diagnostic accuracy and help prioritizing clinically important X-ray or CT studies. To develop and evaluate an AI algorithm for detecting effusion of any kind in knee X-rays and selected CT images and distinguishing between simple effusion and lipo-hemarthrosis indicative of intra-articular fractures. This retrospective study analyzed post traumatic knee imaging from January 2016 to February 2023, categorizing images into lipo-hemarthrosis, simple effusion, or normal. It utilized the FishNet-150 algorithm for image classification, with class activation maps highlighting decision-influential regions. The AI's diagnostic accuracy was validated against a gold standard, based on the evaluations made by a radiologist with at least four years of experience. Analysis included CT images from 515 patients and X-rays from 637 post traumatic patients, identifying lipo-hemarthrosis, simple effusion, and normal findings. The AI showed an AUC of 0.81 for detecting any effusion, 0.78 for simple effusion, and 0.83 for lipo-hemarthrosis in X-rays; and 0.89, 0.89, and 0.91, respectively, in CTs. The AI algorithm effectively detects knee effusion and differentiates between simple effusion and lipo-hemarthrosis in post-traumatic patients for both X-rays and selected CT images further studies are needed to validate these results.",,10.1016/j.ejrad.2024.111460,,,

[et al.],,,,,,,,,,"No simple, accurate diagnostic tests exist for exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI), and EPI remains underdiagnosed in chronic pancreatitis (CP). We sought to develop a digital screening tool to assist clinicians to predict EPI in patients with definite CP. This was a retrospective case-control study of patients with definite CP with/without EPI. Overall, 49 candidate predictor variables were utilized to train a Classification and Regression Tree (CART) model to rank all predictors and select a parsimonious set of predictors for EPI status. Five-fold cross-validation was used to assess generalizability, and the full CART model was compared with 4 additional predictive models. EPI misclassification rate (mRate) served as primary endpoint metric. 274 patients with definite CP from 6 pancreatitis centers across the United States were included, of which 58Â % had EPI based on predetermined criteria. The optimal CART decision tree included 10 variables. The mRate without/with 5-fold cross-validation of the CART was 0.153 (training error) and 0.314 (prediction error), and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.889 and 0.682, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity without/with 5-fold cross-validation was 0.888/0.789 and 0.794/0.535, respectively. A trained second CART without pancreas imaging variables (nÂ =Â 6), yielded 8 variables. Training error/prediction error was 0.190/0.351; sensitivity was 0.869/0.650, and specificity was 0.728/0.649, each without/with 5-fold cross-validation. We developed two CART models that were integrated into one digital screening tool to assess for EPI in patients with definite CP and with two to six input variables needed for predicting EPI status.",,10.1016/j.pan.2024.04.003,,,

However, primary and community hospitals often have limited access to advanced equipment and technology. Complete blood count (CBC), which is commonly used in these hospitals, offers the advantages of being cost-effective and easily accessible. This study aims to evaluate the significance of routine blood indicators in aiding of diagnosing AE-COPD. In this research, we enrolled a total of 112 patients diagnosed with AE-COPD, 92 patients with stable COPD, and a control group comprising 60 healthy individuals. Clinical characteristics, CBC parameters, and serum CRP levels were collected within two hours. To assess the associations between NLR/PLR/MLR and CRP by Spearman correlation test. The diagnostic accuracy of NLR, PLR and MLR in AE-COPD was assessed using Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (ROC) and the area under the curve (AUC). Binary Logistic Regression analysis was conducted for the indicators of NLR, PLR and MLR. We found that patients with AE-COPD had significantly higher levels of NLR, PLR and MLR in contrast to patients with stable COPD. Additionally, the study revealed a noteworthy correlation between CRP and NLR (rs=0.5319, P<0.001), PLR (rs=0.4424, P<0.001), and MLR (rs=0.4628, P<0.001). By utilizing specific cut-off values, the amalgamation of NLR, PLR and MLR augmented diagnostic sensitivity. Binary logistic regression analysis demonstrated that heightened NLR and MLR act as risk factors for the progression of AE-COPD. The increasing levels of NLR, PLR and MLR could function as biomarkers, akin to CRP, for diagnosis and assessment of acute exacerbations among COPD patients. Further research is required to validate this concept.",,10.2147/COPD.S452444,,,

The grading of ccRCC is important in determining tumour aggressiveness and clinical management. The objectives of this research were to predict the WHO/ISUP grade of ccRCC pre-operatively and characterise the heterogeneity of tumour sub-regions using radiomics and ML models, including comparison with pre-operative biopsy-determined grading in a sub-group. Data were obtained from multiple institutions across two countries, including 391 patients with pathologically proven ccRCC. For analysis, the data were separated into four cohorts. Cohorts 1 and 2 included data from the respective institutions from the two countries, cohort 3 was the combined data from both cohort 1 and 2, and cohort 4 was a subset of cohort 1, for which both the biopsy and subsequent histology from resection (partial or total nephrectomy) were available. 3D image segmentation was carried out to derive a voxel of interest (VOI) mask. Radiomics features were then extracted from the contrast-enhanced images, and the data were normalised. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost model were used to reduce the dimensionality of the features. Thereafter, 11 ML algorithms were implemented for the purpose of predicting the ccRCC grade and characterising the heterogeneity of sub-regions in the tumours. For cohort 1, the 50% tumour core and 25% tumour periphery exhibited the best performance, with an average AUC of 77.9% and 78.6%, respectively. The 50% tumour core presented the highest performance in cohorts 2 and 3, with average AUC values of 87.6% and 76.9%, respectively. With the 25% periphery, cohort 4 showed AUC values of 95.0% and 80.0% for grade prediction when using internal and external validation, respectively, while biopsy histology had an AUC of 31.0% for the classification with the final grade of resection histology as a reference standard. The CatBoost classifier was the best for each of the four cohorts with an average AUC of 80.0%, 86.5%, 77.0% and 90.3% for cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Radiomics signatures combined with ML have the potential to predict the WHO/ISUP grade of ccRCC with superior performance, when compared to pre-operative biopsy. Moreover, tumour sub-regions contain useful information that should be analysed independently when determining the tumour grade. Therefore, it is possible to distinguish the grade of ccRCC pre-operatively to improve patient care and management.",,10.3390/cancers16081454,,,
