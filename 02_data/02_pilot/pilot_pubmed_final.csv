We retrospectively collected patients ≥18 years old who underwent LDLT for ALF between 2010 and 2020 at 35 centers in Asia. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the clinical variables related to short-term mortality and establish a novel scoring system. The Kaplan-Meier method was performed to explore the association between the score and overall survival. Of the 339 recipients, 46 (13.6%) died within 1 year after LDLT. Multivariate analyses revealed 4 independent risk factors for death: use of vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, the higher model for end-stage liver disease score, and a lower graft-to-recipient weight ratio. The internally validated c-statistic of the short-term mortality after transplant (SMT) score derived from these 4 variables was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.74-0.87). The SMT score successfully stratified recipients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with 1-year overall survival rates of 96%, 80%, and 50%, respectively. In conclusion, our novel SMT score based on 4 predictors will guide ALF recipient and living donor selection.","20240429","American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons","Department of Pediatric Surgery and Transplantation, Kumamoto University Graduate School of Medical Sciences, Kumamoto University, Kumamoto, Japan."

Given their profound impact, the development of highly sensitive and specific circulating diagnostic markers becomes imperative to effectively identify and differentiate between cirrhosis and HCC. Accurate diagnosis is paramount in guiding appropriate therapeutic interventions. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the potential of microRNAs (miRNAs) in discerning between HCC and LC. This study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines, with the protocol officially registered on PROSPERO under the reference number CRD42023417494. A thorough search across multiple databases like PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Wiley Online Library, and Science Direct was conducted to identify relevant studies published from January 1, 2018, to August 10, 2023. The included studies underwent methodological quality assessment using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QADAS-2) tool. The synthesis of pooled sensitivity, specificity, and other relevant diagnostic parameters employed a random-effects model and was conducted using Stata 14.0. Heterogeneity was assessed using I2 and Cochrane Q, with subsequent subgroup analysis and meta-regression performed to identify potential sources of observed heterogeneity. A sensitivity analysis was performed to assess the resilience of the findings. Furthermore, Deeks' funnel plot was employed to evaluate publication bias. In this meta-analysis, we included fifteen publications, encompassing 787 HCC patients and 784 LC patients. The combined sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) values of miRNAs in differentiating HCC from LC were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.78-0.88), 0.79 (95% CI: 0.73-0.84), 3.9 (95% CI: 3.0-5.2), 0.21 (95% CI: 0.14-0.29), 19.44 (95% CI: 11-34), and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85-0.91), respectively. The results of the subgroup analysis revealed that upregulated miRNA levels and miRNA assessments specifically for individuals of European descent exhibited superior diagnostic performance. The results of this study suggested that circulating miRNAs, especially those that are upregulated, have the potential to function as robust and promising biomarkers in the differentiation of HCC from LC. https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42023475954.","20240424","Frontiers in medicine","Department of Medical Laboratory Sciences, College of Medicine and Health Sciences, Wollo University, Dessie, Ethiopia."

However, the primary patency of AVF at one year is under 70% due to several risk factors and comorbidities. Leukocyte glucose index (LGI), a new biomarker based on blood leukocytes and glucose values, has been found to be associated with poor outcomes in cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of LGI on the long-term primary patency of AVF following dialysis initiation. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in which we initially enrolled 158 patients with ESKD admitted to the Vascular Surgery Department of the Emergency County Hospital of Targu Mures, Romania, to surgically create an AVF for dialysis between January 2020 and July 2023. The primary endpoint was AVF failure, defined as the impossibility of performing a chronic dialysis session due to severe restenosis or AVF thrombosis. After follow-up, we categorized patients into two groups based on their AVF status: ""functional AVF"" for those with a permeable AVF and ""AVF failure"" for those with vascular access dysfunction. (3) Results: Patients with AVF failure had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.013) and diabetes (p = 0.028), as well as a higher LGI value (1.12 vs. 0.79, p < 0.001). At ROC analysis, LGI had the strongest association with the outcome, with an AUC of 0.729, and an optimal cut-off value of 0.95 (72.4% sensitivity and 68% specificity). In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, patients in the highest tertile (T3) of LGI had a significantly higher incidence of AVF failure compared to those in tertile 1 (p = 0.019). Moreover, we found that patients with higher baseline LGI values had a significantly higher risk of AVF failure during follow-up (HR: 1.48, p = 0.003). The association is independent of age and sex (HR: 1.65, p = 0.001), cardiovascular risk factors (HR: 1.63, p = 0.012), and pre-operative vascular mapping determinations (HR: 3.49, p = 0.037). (4) Conclusions: In conclusion, high preoperative values of LGI are positively associated with long-term AVF failure. The prognostic role of the biomarker was independent of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and pre-operative vascular mapping determinations.","20240401","Journal of clinical medicine","Department of Vascular Surgery, George Emil Palade University of Medicine, Pharmacy, Science and Technology of Targu Mures, 540139 Targu Mures, Romania."

There is increasing evidence that platelets play a crucial role not only in hemostasis but also in inflammation and innate immunity. In this study, we explored the relationship between platelet count, clinical characteristics, and the prognosis of patients with AAV. We divided 187 patients into two groups based on their platelet count. Clinicopathological data and prognostic information were retrospectively gathered from medical records. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for prognosis, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality. The cutoff point for platelet count was set at 264.5 × 109/L, as determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for predicting progression to ESRD in patients with AAV. We observed patients with low platelet count (platelets < 264.5 × 109/L) had lower leukocytes, hemoglobin, complement, acute reactants, and worse renal function (P for eGFR < 0.001). They were also more likely to progress to ESRD or death compared to the high platelet count group (platelets > 264.5 × 109/L) (P < 0.0001, P = 0.0338, respectively). Low platelet count was potentially an independent predictor of poor renal prognosis in the multivariate regression analysis [HR 1.670 (95% CI 1.019-2.515), P = 0.014]. Lower platelet count at diagnosis is associated with more severe clinical characteristics and impaired renal function. Therefore, platelet count may be an accessible prognostic indicator for renal outcomes in patients with AAV.","20240405","Clinical and experimental medicine","Department of Nephrology, Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, No.87 Xiangya Road, Kaifu District, Changsha, Hunan, China."

This observational, prospective, single-center study enrolled consecutive patients aged 18 or older with confirmed acute symptomatic PE and no prior anticoagulation. The study aims to assess the prognostic capacity of sP-selectin measured at the time of PE diagnosis for short-term mortality and major bleeding. A total of 196 patients, with a mean age of 69.1 years (SD 17), were included, of whom 52.6% were male. Within 30 days, 9.7% of patients (n = 19) died, and 5.1% (n = 10) suffered major bleeding. PE risk stratification revealed 4.6% (n = 9) with high-risk PE, 34.7% (n = 68) with intermediate-high-risk PE, 38.3% (n = 75) with intermediate-low-risk PE, and 22.5% (n = 44) with low-risk PE according to the European Society of Cardiology score. Mean plasma sP-selectin levels were comparable between survivors and non-survivors (489.7 ng/mL ±63 vs. 497.3 ng/mL ±51; p = .9).

The association between the amplitude reduction ratios of FCoMEPs and BR at the end of surgery and postoperative facial nerve function was determined. Subsequently, the optimal threshold of FCoMEPs and BR for predicting postoperative facial nerve dysfunction were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Valid BR was record in 103 of 110 patients, whereas only 43 patients successfully recorded FCoMEP in orbicularis oculi muscle. A reduction over 50.3% in FCoMEP (O. oris) amplitude was identified as a predictor of postoperative facial nerve dysfunction (sensitivity, 77.1%; specificity, 83.6%).

Initially, PMAC was considered a metastatic manifestation of other cancers; however, instances of non-metastatic PMAC have been documented through monitoring, epidemiological studies, and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of PMAC and discern the prognostic differences between PMAC and the more prevalent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The study used data from the SEER database from 2000 to 2018 to identify patients diagnosed with PMAC or PDAC. To ensure comparable demographic characteristics between PDAC and PMAC, propensity score matching was employed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyse overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine independent risk factors influencing OS and CSS. Additionally, the construction and validation of risk-scoring models for OS and CSS were achieved through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-Cox regression technique. The SEER database included 84,857 patients with PDAC and 3345 patients with PMAC. Notably, significant distinctions were observed in the distribution of tumour sites, diagnosis time, use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, tumour size, grading, and staging between the two groups. The prognosis exhibited notable improvement among married individuals, those receiving acceptable chemotherapy, and those with focal PMAC (p < 0.05). Conversely, patients with elevated log odds of positive lymph node scores or higher pathological grades in the pancreatic tail exhibited a more unfavourable prognosis (p < 0.05).

Tokyo and ordinance-designated cities in provinces were defined as urban cities, and those without such cities were defined as regional cities. The primary endpoint was the presence or absence of a stroke care unit. Multiple linear regression analysis revealed that the presence of stroke care units was significantly associated with the number of neurosurgical specialists. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to predict the number of personnel required for stroke care unit installation based on the number of neurosurgical specialists. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, Youden index, sensitivity, and specificity were 0.721, 0.483, 0.783, and 0.700, respectively. Our study underscores the indispensability of SCUs in stroke treatment, advocating for a strategic allocation of medical resources, heightened accessibility to neurosurgical specialists, and a concerted effort to address geographic and resource imbalances. The identified cutoff value of 8.99 neurosurgical specialists per 100,000 population serves as a practical benchmark for optimizing SCU establishment, thereby potentially mitigating stroke-related mortality.","20240425","Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association","Department of Operation Center, National Hospital Organization Nagasaki Medical Center, Nagasaki 856-8562, Japan; Department of Nursing, Nagasaki University Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences, Nagasaki 852-8523, Japan; Healthcare Management Research Center, Chiba University Hospital, 1-8-1 Inohana, Chuo-ku, Chiba 260-8677, Japan."

Despite its infrequent adverse effects within therapeutic range, prolonged VPA usage may result in metabolic disturbances including insulin resistance and dyslipidemia. These metabolic dysregulations in childhood are notably linked to heightened cardiovascular risk in adulthood. Therefore, identification and effective management of dyslipidemia in children hold paramount significance. Methods: In this retrospective cohort study, we explored the potential associations between physiological factors, medication situation, biochemical parameters before the first dose of VPA (baseline) and VPA-induced dyslipidemia (VID) in pediatric patients. Binary logistic regression was utilized to construct a predictive model for blood lipid disorders, aiming to identify independent pre-treatment risk factors. Additionally, The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the performance of the model. Results: Through binary logistic regression analysis, we identified for the first time that direct bilirubin (DBIL) (odds ratios (OR) = 0.511, p = 0.01), duration of medication (OR = 0.357, p = 0.009), serum albumin (ALB) (OR = 0.913, p = 0.043), BMI (OR = 1.140, p = 0.045), and aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (OR = 1.038, p = 0.026) at baseline were independent risk factors for VID in pediatric patients with epilepsy. Notably, the predictive ability of DBIL (AUC = 0.690, p < 0.0001) surpassed that of other individual factors. Furthermore, when combined into a predictive model, incorporating all five risk factors, the predictive capacity significantly increased (AUC = 0.777, p < 0.0001), enabling the forecast of 77.7% of dyslipidemia events. Conclusion: DBIL emerges as the most potent predictor, and in conjunction with the other four factors, can effectively forecast VID in pediatric patients with epilepsy. This insight can guide the formulation of individualized strategies for the clinical administration of VPA in children.","20240402","Frontiers in pharmacology","Department of Pharmacy, The Second Xiangya Hospital of Central South University, Institute of Clinical Pharmacy, Central South University, Changsha, China."

A total of 318 metabolites were identified, of which 54 differential metabolites (25 upregulated and 29 downregulated) were detected in pediatric cataract group compared with controls (variable importance of projection >1.0, fold change ≥1.5 or ≤ 0.667 and P < 0.05). A significant accumulation of N-Acetyl-Dl-glutamic acid was observed in pediatric cataract group. The differential metabolites were mainly enriched in histidine metabolism (increased L-Histidine and decreased 1-Methylhistamine) and the tryptophan metabolism (increased N-Formylkynurenine and L-Kynurenine). 5-Aminosalicylic acid showed strong positive mutual inter-correlation with L-Tyrosinemethylester and N,N-Diethylethanolamine, both of which were down-regulated in pediatric cataract group. The ROC analysis implied 11 metabolites served as potential biomarkers for pediatric cataract patients (all area under the ROC curve ≥0.900). These results illustrated novel potential metabolites and metabolic pathways in pediatric cataract, which provides new insights into the pathophysiology of pediatric cataract.","20240422","Experimental eye research","State Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology, Zhongshan Ophthalmic Center, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Ophthalmology and Visual Science, Guangdong Provincial Clinical Research Center for Ocular Diseases, Guangzhou, Guangdong, China."

No single tool for detecting MetS is suitable for all pediatric populations. This study aimed to investigate the association between obesity measures and MetS in Korean children and adolescents. The data were obtained from 1663 children and adolescents aged 10-19 years (771 girls) who participated in the Fourth and Fifth Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. Body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHtR) were included as obesity measures. Fasting blood glucose, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and resting blood pressure were included as metabolic risk factors. MetS was defined as the clustering of metabolic risk factors such as elevated fasting blood glucose, elevated mean arterial pressure, elevated triglycerides, and low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Regardless of the obesity measures used, obese children and adolescents were more likely to have a clustering of metabolic risk factors compared to their non-obese counterparts: BMI-based obesity (odds ratio, OR=4.151, 95% confidence interval, CI=2.763~6.238, p<0.001), WC-based obesity (OR=1.917, 95% CI=1.066~3.446, p=0.010), and WHtR-based obesity (OR=2.160 and 95% CI=1.203~3.878, p=0.003). A receiver operating curve analysis showed that BMI (area under the curve, AUC=0.849, 95% CI=0.8270.871) outperformed WC (AUC=0.833, 95% CI=0.8090.856) and WHtR (AUC=0.794, 95% CI=0.7670.821) in detecting the presence of MetS.

We aimed to explore ML-CPMs' applications in VTE for risk stratification, outcome prediction, diagnosis, and treatment.  Three databases were searched: PubMed, Google Scholar, and IEEE electronic library. Inclusion criteria focused on studies using structured data, excluding non-English publications, studies on non-humans, and certain data types such as natural language processing and image processing. Studies involving pregnant women, cancer patients, and children were also excluded. After excluding irrelevant studies, a total of 77 studies were included.  Most studies report that ML-CPMs outperformed traditional CPMs in terms of receiver operating area under the curve in the four clinical domains that were explored. However, the majority of the studies were retrospective, monocentric, and lacked detailed model architecture description and external validation, which are essential for quality audit. This review identified research gaps and highlighted challenges related to standardized reporting, reproducibility, and model comparison.  ML-CPMs show promise in improving risk assessment and individualized treatment recommendations in VTE.

Methods: TGD individuals underwent body composition studies by bioelectrical impedance analysis according to designated sex at birth, and their muscle-to-fat ratio (MFR) z-scores were calculated. Generalized estimating equations with binary logistic models (n = 326) were used to explore associations while adjusting for potential confounders. Results: A total of 55 TGD females and 111 TGD males, with mean age of 18 ± 1.9 years and median duration of GAHT of 1.4 years (interquartile range = 0.6-2.5), were enrolled. Overall, 118/166 (71%) of the TGD cohort showed evidence of at least one MetS component, with a significantly higher rate among TGD males compared with TGD females (91.1% vs. 50.9%, p < 0.001). TGD males were at increased odds for overweight/obesity, elevated/hypertensive BP, elevated triglycerides (TGs), and an atherogenic dyslipidemia index (TG/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [HDL-c], TG:HDL-c). The odds of overweight/obesity increased by 44.9 for each standard deviation decrease in the MFR z-score, while the odds for an elevated TG:HDL-c index increased by 3.7. Psychiatric morbidity increased the odds for overweight/obesity by 2.89. Conclusions: After considering confounding variables, the TGD males on GAHT were found to be at an increased risk for cardiometabolic disease.

The current study aims to compare indirect radiographic signs of instability in a symptomatic BHD population to those in a healthy cohort. The study group consisted of patients with a lateral centre-edge angle (LCEA) with values 18° ≤ LCEA < 25° who underwent corrective periacetabular osteotomy (PAO) and reported an improvement in patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs). The comparison group consisted of a healthy cohort of athletes who did not complain of any hip-related symptoms and who had normal values of their hip morphological parameters (LCEA, acetabular index (AI°), alpha angle (α°), femoral version, acetabular version). Indirect signs of instability consisting of the femoro-epiphyseal acetabular roof index (FEAR), iliocapsularis-to-rectus-femoris (IC/RF) ratio and labral dimensions (height-to-length ratio) were assessed in both groups. Partial Pearson correlation, logistic multiple regression analysis and Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were performed to determine correlations, as well as the sensitivity and specificity of these signs to differentiate between healthy hips and BHD. On binary logistic multiple regression analysis, the FEAR Index was the only independent predictor to differentiate between BHD and healthy hips (p < 0.001). The IC/RF ratio did not achieve significance. The calculated area under the curve (AUC) was 0.93 (0.87 - 0.99, CI 95%, p < 0.001) for the FEAR Index and 0.81 (0.70 - 0.92, CI 95%, p < 0.001) for the height-length ratio. Using the predefined cut-off values (dysplastic-FEAR Index ≥ 5° or labral height-to-length ratio ≤ 0.5), 27% sensitivity/100% specificity and 20% sensitivity/ 100% specificity, were achieved. ROC analysis provided the following new thresholds: FEAR Index ≥ -5° (73% sensitivity/97% specificity); labral height-to-length ratio ≤ 0.8 (70% sensitivity, 79% specificity). In our cohort, the FEAR index was an independent parameter that could differentiate between borderline dysplastic and asymptomatic hips.

The primary analysis was the agreement between the ordinal mRS predictions of the model or physician and the ground truth using the Gwet Agreement Coefficient. We also evaluated the ability to identify unfavorable outcomes (mRS >2) using the area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity. Noninferiority analyses were undertaken using limits of 0.1 for the Gwet Agreement Coefficient and 0.05 for the area under the curve analysis. The accuracy of prediction was also assessed using the mean absolute error for prediction, percentage of predictions ±1 categories away from the ground truth (±1 accuracy [ACC]), and percentage of exact predictions (ACC). To predict the specific mRS score, the DLPD yielded a Gwet Agreement Coefficient score of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.71-0.86), surpassing the physicians' score of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.67-0.84), and was noninferior to the readers (P < .001). For identifying unfavorable outcome, the model achieved an area under the curve of 0.81 (95% CI, 0.72-0.89), again noninferior to the readers' area under the curve of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.69-0.87) (P < .005). The mean absolute error, ±1ACC, and ACC were 0.89, 81%, and 36% for the DLPD.

While conventional criteria rely on 2D measurements, volumetric analysis may provide a more comprehensive response assessment. There is sparse research on the role of volumetrics in pediatric gliomas. Our purpose was to compare 2D and volumetric analysis with the assessment of neuroradiologists using the Brain Tumor Reporting and Data System (BT-RADS) in BRAF V600E-mutant pediatric gliomas. Manual volumetric segmentations of whole and solid tumors were compared with 2D measurements in 31 participants (292 follow-up studies) in the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium 002 trial (NCT01748149). Two neuroradiologists evaluated responses using BT-RADS. Receiver operating characteristic analysis compared classification performance of 2D and volumetrics for partial response. Agreement between volumetric and 2D mathematically modeled longitudinal trajectories for 25 participants was determined using the model-estimated time to best response. Of 31 participants, 20 had partial responses according to BT-RADS criteria. Receiver operating characteristic curves for the classification of partial responders at the time of first detection (median = 2 months) yielded an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI, 0.69-0.99) for 2D area, 0.91 (95% CI, 0.80-1.00) for whole-volume, and 0.92 (95% CI, 0.82-1.00) for solid volume change. There was no significant difference in the area under the curve between 2D and solid (P = .34) or whole volume (P = .39). There was no significant correlation in model-estimated time to best response (ρ = 0.39, P >.05) between 2D and whole-volume trajectories. Eight of the 25 participants had a difference of ≥90 days in transition from partial response to stable disease between their 2D and whole-volume modeled trajectories. Although there was no overall difference between volumetrics and 2D in classifying partial response assessment using BT-RADS, further prospective studies will be critical to elucidate how the observed differences in tumor 2D and volumetric trajectories affect clinical decision-making and outcomes in some individuals.","20240408","AJNR.

The objectives of this research were to predict the WHO/ISUP grade of ccRCC pre-operatively and characterise the heterogeneity of tumour sub-regions using radiomics and ML models, including comparison with pre-operative biopsy-determined grading in a sub-group. Data were obtained from multiple institutions across two countries, including 391 patients with pathologically proven ccRCC. For analysis, the data were separated into four cohorts. Cohorts 1 and 2 included data from the respective institutions from the two countries, cohort 3 was the combined data from both cohort 1 and 2, and cohort 4 was a subset of cohort 1, for which both the biopsy and subsequent histology from resection (partial or total nephrectomy) were available. 3D image segmentation was carried out to derive a voxel of interest (VOI) mask. Radiomics features were then extracted from the contrast-enhanced images, and the data were normalised. The Pearson correlation coefficient and the XGBoost model were used to reduce the dimensionality of the features. Thereafter, 11 ML algorithms were implemented for the purpose of predicting the ccRCC grade and characterising the heterogeneity of sub-regions in the tumours. For cohort 1, the 50% tumour core and 25% tumour periphery exhibited the best performance, with an average AUC of 77.9% and 78.6%, respectively. The 50% tumour core presented the highest performance in cohorts 2 and 3, with average AUC values of 87.6% and 76.9%, respectively. With the 25% periphery, cohort 4 showed AUC values of 95.0% and 80.0% for grade prediction when using internal and external validation, respectively, while biopsy histology had an AUC of 31.0% for the classification with the final grade of resection histology as a reference standard. The CatBoost classifier was the best for each of the four cohorts with an average AUC of 80.0%, 86.5%, 77.0% and 90.3% for cohorts 1, 2, 3 and 4 respectively. Radiomics signatures combined with ML have the potential to predict the WHO/ISUP grade of ccRCC with superior performance, when compared to pre-operative biopsy. Moreover, tumour sub-regions contain useful information that should be analysed independently when determining the tumour grade. Therefore, it is possible to distinguish the grade of ccRCC pre-operatively to improve patient care and management.","20240410","Cancers","Division of Imaging Sciences and Technology, School of Medicine, Ninewells Hospital, University of Dundee, Dundee DD1 9SY, UK."

As this new infrastructure would undoubtedly change the traffic network, there is a need for more understanding of its potential safety impact. Unfortunately, many advanced real-time crash prediction models encounter an important challenge in their applicability due to their demand for a substantial volume of data for direct modeling. To tackle this challenge, we proposed a simple yet effective approach - anomaly detection learning, which formulates model as an anomaly detection problem, solves it through normality feature recognition, and predicts crashes by identifying deviations from the normal state. The proposed approach demonstrates significant improvement in the Area Under the Curve (AUC), sensitivity, and False Alarm Rate (FAR). When juxtaposed with the prevalent direct classification paradigm, our proposed anomaly detection learning (ADL) consistently outperforms in AUC (with an increase of up to 45%), sensitivity (experiencing up to a 45% increase), and FAR (reducing by up to 0.53). The most performance gain is attained through the combination of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) in an ensemble, resulting in a 0.78 AUC, 0.79 sensitivity, and a 0.22 false alarm rate. Furthermore, we analyzed model features with a game-theoretic approach illustrating the most correlated features for accurate prediction, revealing the attention of advanced convolution neural networks to occupancy features. This provided crucial insights into improving crash precaution, the findings from which not only benefit private stakeholders but also extend a promising opportunity for governmental intervention on the express lane.

This study aimed to determine the optimal warning thresholds for combined somatosensory-evoked potentials (SSEP) and motor-evoked potentials (MEP) for predicting postoperative neurological deterioration in surgical treatment for TSS based on different pathologies. Additionally, we explored the correlation between SSEP/MEP monitoring and postoperative spinal neurological function. Retrospective study. Two hundred five patients. We obtained perioperative modified Japanese Orthopedic Association (mJOA) scores to assess spinal neurological function. The data collected in this study included demographic data, intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) signals, and perioperative neurological function assessments. To determine the optimal IONM warning threshold, a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used. Additionally, Pearson correlation analysis was conducted to determine the correlation between IONM signals and clinical neurological conditions. A total of 205 consecutive patients were eligible. Forty-one patients had thoracic disc herniation (TDH), 14 had ossification of the posterior longitudinal ligament (OPLL), 124 had ossification of the ligamentum flavum (OLF), and 26 had OPLL+OLF. The mean mJOA scores before surgery and 3 months after surgery were 7.0 and 7.9, respectively, resulting in a mean mJOA recovery rate (RR) of 23.1%. The average postoperative mJOA RRs for patients with TDH, OPLL, OLF, and OPLL+OLF were 24.8%, 10.4%, 26.8%, and 11.2%, respectively. Patients with OPLL+OLF exhibited a more stringent threshold for IONM changes. This included a lower amplitude cutoff value (a decrease of 49.0% in the SSEP amplitude and 57.5% in the MEP amplitude for short-term prediction) and a shorter duration of waveform change (19.5 minutes for SSEP and 22.5 minutes for MEP for short-term prediction). On the other hand, patients with TDH had more lenient IONM warning criteria (a decrease of 49.0% in SSEP amplitude and 77.5% in MEP amplitude for short-term prediction; durations of change of 25.5 minutes for SSEP and 32.5 minutes for MEP). However, OPLL patients or OLF patients had moderate and similar IONM warning thresholds. Additionally, there was a stronger correlation between the SSEP amplitude variability ratio and the JOA RR in OPLL+OLF patients, while the correlation was stronger between the MEP amplitude variability ratio and the JOA RR for the other three TSS pathologies. Optimal IONM change criteria for prediction vary depending on different TSS pathologies. The optimal monitoring strategy for prediction varies depending on TSS pathologies.","20240427","The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society","Department of Anesthesiology, Xi'an Honghui Hospital, Xi'an Jiaotong University Health Science Center, Xi'an, China."

Hepatectomy with extended resection and additional adjuvant or targeted therapy can significantly improve the survival rate of MVI+ patients by eradicating micrometastasis. Preoperative prediction of MVI status is of great clinical significance for surgical decision-making and the selection of other adjuvant therapy strategies to improve the prognosis of patients. Established a radiomics machine learning model based on multimodal MRI and clinical data, and analyzed the preoperative prediction value of this model for microvascular invasion (MVI) of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The preoperative liver MRI data and clinical information of 130 HCC patients who were pathologically confirmed to be pathologically confirmed were retrospectively studied. These patients were divided into MVI-positive group (MVI+) and MVI-negative group (MVI-) based on postoperative pathology. After a series of dimensionality reduction analysis, six radiomic features were finally selected. Then, linear support vector machine (linear SVM), support vector machine with rbf kernel function (rbf-SVM), logistic regression (LR), Random forest (RF) and XGBoost (XGB) algorithms were used to establish the MVI prediction model for preoperative HCC patients. Then, rbf-SVM with the best predictive performance was selected to construct the radiomics score (R-score).

Aim of this study was to combine sublingual video-microscopy, plasma proteomics and live cell imaging to uncover further pathways of eGC damage in patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or bacterial sepsis. This secondary analysis of the prospective multicenter MICROCODE study included 22 patients with COVID-19 and 43 patients with bacterial sepsis admitted to intermediate or intensive care units and 10 healthy controls. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) was strongly associated with damaged eGC and correlated both with eGC dimensions (rs=0.36, p = 0.0015) and circulating eGC biomarkers. In vitro, IL-6 reduced eGC height and coverage, which was inhibited by blocking IL-6 signalling with the anti-IL-6 receptor antibody tocilizumab or the Janus kinase inhibitor tofacitinib. Exposure of endothelial cells to 5% serum from COVID-19 or sepsis patients resulted in a significant decrease in eGC height, which was attenuated by co-incubation with tocilizumab. In an external COVID-19 cohort of 219 patients from Massachusetts General Hospital, a previously identified proteomic eGC signature correlated with IL-6 (rs=-0.58, p < 0.0001) and predicted the combined endpoint of 28-day mortality and/or intubation (ROC-AUC: 0.86 [95% CI: 0.81-0.91], p < 0.001).

Meanwhile, the correlation between lncRNAs expression and laboratory indicators was analyzed. The diagnostic value was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Finally, combined with laboratory indicators, a diagnostic model for SNRA was constructed based on logistic regression and visualized by nomogram. Expression of ADGRE5, FAM157A, PTPN6 and PTPRE in peripheral blood was significantly increased in RA than healthy donors. Meanwhile, we analyzed the relationship between lncRNAs and erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein and CD4 + T cell-related cytokines and transcription factors.

Consequently, we detected soluble CD155 (sCD155) as a potential biomarker for diagnosing VI in hepatic alveolar echinococcosis (HAE). Blood samples were from 42 AE patients and 49 healthy controls (HCs). Based on the computed tomography (CT) and contrast-enhanced CT, AE patients were further categorized into HAE with VI (VIAE; 27 cases) and HAE without VI (NVAE; 15 cases). The sCD155 concentration was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Correlations between sCD155 expression levels and clinicopathological features of AE patients were analyzed using SPSS and GraphPad Prism software. The sCD155 concentrations in AE patients were significantly higher than in HCs. The serum sCD155 level significantly differed between the VIAE and NVAE groups. The univariate analysis showed that VI of AE was significantly correlated with the sCD155 level when the sCD155 was greater than 11 ng/mL. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, the multivariable analysis showed that sCD155 had an independent effect on VI of HAE. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that sCD155 could differentially diagnose VI of HAE at the cut-off value of 11.08 ng/mL with an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.75.

To overcome the problem of inadequate Whole-Slide Image (WSI) samples with weak labels, pseudo-bag-based multiple instance learning (MIL) methods have attracted wide attention in pathology image classification. In this type of method, the division scheme of pseudo-bags is usually a primary factor affecting classification performance. In order to improve the division of WSI pseudo-bags on existing random/clustering approaches, this paper proposes a new Prototype-driven Division (ProDiv) scheme for the pseudo-bag-based MIL classification framework on pathology images. This scheme first designs an attention-based method to generate a bag prototype for each slide. On this basis, it further groups WSI patch instances into a series of instance clusters according to the feature similarities between the prototype and patches. Finally, pseudo-bags are obtained by randomly combining the non-overlapping patch instances of different instance clusters. Moreover, the design scheme of our ProDiv considers practicality, and it could be smoothly assembled with almost all the MIL-based WSI classification methods in recent years. Empirical results show that our ProDiv, when integrated with several existing methods, can deliver classification AUC improvements of up to 7.3% and 10.3%, respectively on two public WSI datasets. ProDiv could almost always bring obvious performance improvements to compared MIL models on typical metrics, which suggests the effectiveness of our scheme.

Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that |Max2| and |Min2| were more effective than |Min1| in distinguishing different types of HA patients, with higher diagnostic efficacy. The standard curves based on Actin FSL reagent for normal and low levels of FVIII:C-|Max2| were established, with R2 values of 0.98 and 0.99, respectively. These curves can be utilized for monitoring during replacement therapies involving full-length recombinant FVIII and B-domain-deleted FVIII. Thirty cases of HA patients utilized the FVIII-|Max2| standard curve to obtain individual pharmacokinetics characteristic parameters. The clearance, half-life (t1/2), time to FVIII:C of 1% above baseline (tt1%), and predicted dosage showed no statistically significant differences compared with one-stage assay (p > 0.05).  CWA is an economical and practical tool, and its related parameters are associated with the severity of HA.

We searched PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science for original research from inception to October 27, 2022. We defined favorable surgical outcome (FSO) as Engel class I, International League Against Epilepsy class 1, or seizure-free status. The prognostic value of crHFOs-area for FSO was assessed by (1) the pooled FSO proportion after crHFOs-area; (2) FSO for crHFOs-area vs without crHFOs-area; and (3) the predictive performance. We defined high combined prognostic value as FSO proportion >80% + FSO crHFOs-area >without crHFOs-area + area under the curve (AUC) >0.75 and examined this for the clinical subgroups (study design, age, diagnostic type, HFOs-identification method, HFOs-rate thresholding, and iEEG state). Temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE) was compared with extra-TLE through dichotomous variable analysis. Individual patient analysis was performed for sex, affected hemisphere, MRI findings, surgery location, and pathology.

SDF was assessed using sperm chromatin structure assay. Patients were divided into four groups according to embryo transfer cycle type and maternal age, and the correlation between SDF and chromosome aberration was analyzed. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to find the optimal threshold. Total chromosomal aneuploidy rate was 54.95%, and trisomy was the most common abnormality (71.32%). The chromosomally abnormal group had higher SDF than the normal group (11.42% [6.82%, 16.54%] vs. 12.95% [9.61%, 20.58%], P = 0.032). After grouping, elevated SDF was significantly correlated with an increasing chromosome aneuploidy rate only in women of advanced age who underwent fresh embryo transfer (adjusted odds ratio:1.14 [1.00-1.29], adjusted-P = 0.045). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that SDF can predict the occurrence of chromosomal abnormality of miscarried conceptus in this group ((area under the curve = 0.76 [0.60-0.91], P = 0.005), and 8.5% was the optimum threshold. When SDF was ≥ 8.5%, the risk of such patients increased by 5.76 times (adjusted odds ratio: 6.76 [1.20-37.99], adjusted-P = 0.030).

In this study, we proposed UsIL-6, a high-performance bioinformatics tool for identifying IL-6 inducing peptides. First, we extracted five groups of physicochemical properties and sequence structural information from IL-6 inducing peptide sequences, and obtained a 636-dimensional feature vector, we also employed NearMiss3 undersampling method and normalization method StandardScaler to process the data. Then, a 40-dimensional optimal feature vector was obtained by Boruta feature selection method. Finally, we combined this feature vector with extreme randomization tree classifier to build the final model UsIL-6. The AUC value of UsIL-6 on the independent test dataset was 0.87, and the BACC value was 0.808, which indicated that UsIL-6 had better performance than the existing methods in IL-6 inducing peptide recognition.

This cross-sectional study surveyed 315 inpatients with AECOPD from a tertiary hospital in China from August 2022 to June 2023. Patient frailty and PROs were assessed using the validated FRAIL scale and mCOPD-PRO, respectively. Spearman's ρ was used to assess the relevance of lung disease indicators commonly used in clinical practice, and ordinal logistic regression analyses were used to identify the variables associated with frailty status. The validity of mCOPD-PRO in discriminating frail or non-frail individuals was determined using the receiver operating characteristic curve. The participants (N=302, mean age 72.4±9.1 years) were predominantly males (73.2%). Among them, 43 (14.3%) patients were not frail, whereas 123 (40.7%) and 136 (45.0%) patients were pre-frail and frail, respectively. The FRAIL scale was moderately correlated with the mCOPD-PRO scores (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient [Rs]=0.52, P<0.01) for all dimensions (Rs=0.43-0.49, P<0.01). Patients residing in rural areas (odds ratio [OR], 1.67; 95% confidence interval [95% CI], 1.01-2.76) and with higher mCOPD-PRO scores (OR, 4.78; 95% CI, 2.75-8.32) were more likely to be frail. Physically active patients (OR, 0.42; 95% CI, 0.21-0.84) were less likely to be frail. In addition, mCOPD-PRO had good discriminate validity for detecting frailty (area under the curve=0.78), with a sensitivity and specificity of 84.6% and 60.8%, respectively. The optimal probability threshold for mCOPD-PRO was ≥1.52 points. In patients with AECOPD, frailty is closely related to PROs and disease characteristics. Additionally, the mCOPD-PRO score can distinguish well between frail and non-frail patients.

This multicenter retrospective study included women of childbearing age diagnosed with IGE from 16 epilepsy centers. Study outcomes included worsening or recurrence of generalized tonic-clonic seizure (GTCS) at 12 months and 24 months after the switch from VPA to an alternative ASM. The comparative effectiveness of LEV and LTG as alternative ASM following VPA discontinuation was assessed through inverse probability treatment-weighted (IPTW) Cox regression analysis. We included 426 women with IGE, with a median (interquartile range) age at VPA switch of 24 (19-30) years and a median VPA dosage of 750 (500-1,000) mg/d. The most common reason for VPA switch was teratogenicity concern in 249 women (58.6%), and the most common ASM used in place of VPA was LEV in 197 (46.2%) cases, followed by LTG in 140 (32.9%). GTCS worsening/recurrence occurred in 105 (24.6%) and 139 (32.6%) women at 12 and 24 months, respectively. Catamenial worsening of seizures, higher VPA dosage during switch, multiple seizure types, and shorter duration of GTCS freedom before switch were independent predictors of GTCS recurrence or worsening at 12 months according to mixed multivariable logistic regression analysis. After internal-external validation through 16 independent cohorts, the model showed an area under the curve of 0.71 (95% CI 0.64-0.77).

Intraoperative neurophysiological monitoring (IONM) has become a necessary adjunctive tool for IMSCT resection. The current study aimed to explore the application value of D-wave monitoring in IMSCT surgery, and tried to investigate a tailored criterion for its early warning. A retrospective clinical study. A retrospective analysis was conducted based on the data of patients who underwent IMSCT surgeries performed by the same neurosurgical team at our hospital. IONM was applied in all surgeries. According to inclusion and exclusion criteria, ultimately 90 patients were enrolled in the study. The McCormick Scale (MMS) was applied to assess the functional outcome through outpatient visits or telephone follow-up at one month and six months postoperatively. Patients with an MMS grade over II one month after surgery were considered to have newly developed postoperative motor dysfunction (PMD). If the MMS grade could be restored to I or II six months after surgery, it was defined as a short-term PMD. Otherwise, it was defined as a long-term PMD. The predictive value of different IONM modalities, including somatosensory evoked potential (SEP), muscle motor evoked potential (MEP), and D-wave for PMD, was assessed with sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and subsequent logistic regression analysis. At last, the cut-off value of the D-wave amplitude reduction ratio for predicting PMD was obtained through the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. SEP showed the worst performance in predicting short-term and long-term PMD. Significant MEP changes were indicated as an independent predictive factor for short-term PMD (OR 5.062, 95% CI 1.947-13.166, p=.001), while D-wave changes were demonstrated as an independent predictor for long-term PMD (OR 339.433, 95% CI 11.337-10770.311, p=.001). The optimum cut-off value of the D-wave amplitude reduction ratio for predicting long-term PMD was 42.18%, with a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity of 93.8% (AUC=0.981, p<.001). D-wave monitoring showed extremely high specificity in predicting PMD compared to SEP and MEP monitoring. Moreover, the authors suggested that a D-wave amplitude reduction of over 40% during IMSCT surgery generally indicates long-term PMD for patients.","20240426","The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society","Department of Neuroelectrophysiology, Beijing Neurosurgical Institute, Capital Medical University, No. 119 South Fourth Ring West Road, Fengtai District, Beijing, 100070, P.R.

The classification and diagnosis of MDD is crucial for effective treatment. Traditional methods, based on clinical assessment, are subjective and rely on healthcare professionals' expertise. Recently, there's growing interest in using Resting-State Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (rs-fMRI) to objectively understand MDD's neurobiology, complementing traditional diagnostics. The posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) is a pivotal brain region implicated in MDD which could be used to identify MDD from healthy controls. Thus, this study presents an intelligent approach based on rs-fMRI data to enhance the classification of MDD. Original rs-fMRI data were collected from a cohort of 430 participants, comprising 197 patients and 233 healthy controls. Subsequently, the data underwent preprocessing using DPARSF, and the amplitudes of low-frequency fluctuation values were computed to reduce data dimensionality and feature count. Then data associated with the PCC were extracted. After eliminating redundant features, various types of Support Vector Machines (SVMs) were employed as classifiers for intelligent categorization. Ultimately, we compared the performance of each algorithm, along with its respective optimal classifier, based on classification accuracy, true positive rate, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC). Upon analyzing the comparison results, we determined that the Random Forest (RF) algorithm, in conjunction with a sophisticated Gaussian SVM classifier, demonstrated the highest performance. Remarkably, this combination achieved a classification accuracy of 81.9 % and a true positive rate of 92.9 %. In conclusion, our study improves the classification of MDD by supplementing traditional methods with rs-fMRI and machine learning techniques, offering deeper neurobiological insights and aiding accuracy, while emphasizing its role as an adjunct to clinical assessment.","20240409","Journal of affective disorders","Department of Psychiatry, Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Wuhan 430000, China; National Institute on Drug Dependence and Beijing Key Laboratory of Drug Dependence Research, Peking University, Beijing 100191, China; Department of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Peking University Health Science Center, Beijing 100191, China."

This study experimentally determined scalars for patients with varying degrees of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), ranging from fatty liver to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. Microsomal, S9, and cytosol fractions were extracted from 36 histologically normal and 66 NAFLD livers (27 nonalcoholic fatty liver [NAFL], 13 NASH, and 26 NASH with cirrhosis). Corrected microsomal protein per gram liver (MPPGL) progressively decreased with disease severity (26.8, 27.4, and 24.3 mg/g in NAFL, NASH, and NASH/cirrhosis, respectively, compared with 35.6 mg/g in normal livers; ANOVA, P < 0.001). Homogenate, S9, and cytosolic protein showed a consistent trend of decline in NASH/cirrhosis relative to normal control (post-hoc t test, P < 0.05). No differences across the groups were observed in homogenate, S9, cytosolic, and microsomal protein content in matched kidney samples. MPPGL-based scalars that combine protein content with liver size revealed that the reduction in MPPGL in NAFL and NASH was compensated by the reported increase in liver size (relative scalar ratios of 0.96 and 0.99, respectively), which was not the case with NASH/cirrhosis (ratio of 0.63), compared with healthy control. Physiologically based pharmacokinetics-informed global sensitivity analysis of the relative contribution of IVIVE scalars (hepatic CYP3A4 abundance, MPPGL, and liver size) to variability in exposure (area under the curve) to three CYP3A substrates (alprazolam, midazolam, and ibrutinib) revealed enzyme abundance as the most significant parameter, followed by MPPGL, whereas liver volume was the least impactful factor. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease-specific scalars necessary for extrapolation from in vitro systems to liver tissue are lacking. These are required in clearance prediction and dose selection in nonalcoholic fatty liver and steatohepatitis populations. Previously reported disease-driven changes have focused on cirrhosis, with no data on the initial stages of liver disease. The authors obtained experimental values for microsomal, cytosolic, and S9 fractions and assessed the relative impact of microsomal scalars on predicted exposure to substrate drugs using physiologically based pharmacokinetics.","20240416","Drug metabolism and disposition: the biological fate of chemicals","Department of Biomedical and Pharmaceutical Sciences, College of Pharmacy, University of Rhode Island, Kingston, Rhode Island."

Initially, the Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) and immune cell infiltration analysis were performed based on RNA data from stroke patients to comprehend the mechanisms governing stroke pathogenesis. The functional analysis, including Gene Ontology (GO), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG), and Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI), was performed based on the Differentially Expressed Gene (DEG) selected by the limma package. 1220 SCFA metabolism-related genes screened from Genecards databases were intersected with 242 genes in main modules determined by Weighted Gene Co-Expression Network Analysis (WGCNA), and the final 10 SCFA key genes were obtained. GO analysis revealed that these genes were involved in immune response processes. Through lasso regression analyses, we established a stroke early diagnosis model and selected 6 genes with diagnostic value. The genes were validated by the area under curve (AUC) values and had a relatively good diagnostic performance. Finally, 4 potential therapeutic drugs targeting these genes were predicted using the Drug Signatures Database (DSigDB) via Enrichr.

With 224 patients included, the positive VUC subcategory showed a specificity of 92.4% (95%CI: 83.2%-97.5%) and a PPV of 91.4 (95%CI: 81%-97.1%). DOR in this subgroup was 6.81. In the suspicious VUC, specificity was 90.9% (95%CI: 81.3%-96.6%), PPV was 88% (95%CI: 75.7%-95.5%) and DOR was 4.23. Combined analysis of positive and suspicious cytologies for detecting high-risk NMIBC showed a sensitivity of 65% (95%CI: 57.3%-73.2%) and a DOR of 9.51. Negative VUC showed high specificity in detecting low-risk (93.2% [95%CI: 87.9%-96.7%]) and a DOR of 6.90 (95%CI: 3.07-15.46). Atypical VUC was the least accurate and had rather low specificity and predictive values. VUC appears to be a good, inexpensive and easily available method to determine risk stratification before surgery. This can be useful in daily practice to determine which patients should receive a single instillation of MMC and to prioritize patients more likely to have a high- risk tumor.","20240424","Urologic oncology","Urology Department, University Hospital 12 de Octubre.

However, the reliance on extensive multicenter datasets for training AI models poses challenges due to privacy concerns. Federated learning provides a solution by facilitating collaborative model training across multiple centers without sharing raw data. This study introduces a federated attention-consistent learning (FACL) framework to address challenges associated with large-scale pathological images and data heterogeneity. FACL enhances model generalization by maximizing attention consistency between local clients and the server model. To ensure privacy and validate robustness, we incorporated differential privacy by introducing noise during parameter transfer. We assessed the effectiveness of FACL in cancer diagnosis and Gleason grading tasks using 19,461 whole-slide images of prostate cancer from multiple centers. In the diagnosis task, FACL achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.9718, outperforming seven centers with an average AUC of 0.9499 when categories are relatively balanced. For the Gleason grading task, FACL attained a Kappa score of 0.8463, surpassing the average Kappa score of 0.7379 from six centers. In conclusion, FACL offers a robust, accurate, and cost-effective AI training model for prostate cancer pathology while maintaining effective data safeguards.","20240405","Computational and structural biotechnology journal","Shenzhen International Graduate School, Tsinghua University, Shenzhen, 518055, China."

Liver fibrosis is an important clinical endpoint of the progression of autoimmune liver disease (AILD); its monitoring would benefit from noninvasive imaging tools. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to assess the relationship between MR elastography (MRE) liver stiffness measurements and histologic liver fibrosis, as well as to evaluate the performance of MRE and biochemical-based clinical markers for stratifying histologic liver fibrosis severity, in children and young adults with AILD. METHODS. This retrospective study used an existing institutional registry of children and young adults diagnosed with AILD (primary sclerosing cholangitis [PSC], autoimmune sclerosing cholangitis [ASC], or autoimmune hepatitis [AIH]). The registry was searched to identify patients who underwent both a research abdominal 1.5-T MRI examination that included liver MRE (performed for registry enrollment) and a clinically indicated liver biopsy within 6 months of that examination. MRE used a 2D gradient-recalled echo sequence. One analyst measured mean liver shear stiffness (in kilopascals) for each examination. Laboratory markers of liver fibrosis (aspartate aminotransferase-to-platelet ratio index [APRI] and fibrosis-4 [FIB-4] score) were recorded. For investigational purposes, one pathologist, blinded to clinical and MRI data, determined histologic Metavir liver fibrosis stage. The Spearman rank order correlation coefficient was calculated between MRE liver stiffness and Metavir liver fibrosis stage. ROC analysis was used to evaluate diagnostic performance for identifying advanced fibrosis (i.e., differentiating Metavir F0-F1 from F2-F4 fibrosis), and sensitivity and specificity were calculated using the Youden index. RESULTS. The study included 46 patients (median age, 16.6 years [IQR, 13.7-17.8 years]; 20 female patients, 26 male patients); 12 had PSC, 10 had ASC, and 24 had AIH. Median MRE liver stiffness was 2.9 kPa (IQR, 2.2-4.0 kPa). MRE liver stiffness and Metavir fibrosis stage showed strong positive correlation (ρ = 0.68). For identifying advanced liver fibrosis, MRE liver stiffness had an AUC of 0.81, with sensitivity of 65.4% and specificity of 90.0%; APRI had an AUC of 0.72, with sensitivity of 64.0% and specificity of 80.0%; and FIB-4 score had an AUC of 0.71, with sensitivity of 60.0% and specificity of 85.0%. CONCLUSION. MRE liver stiffness measurements were associated with histologic liver fibrosis severity. CLINICAL IMPACT. The findings support a role for MRE in noninvasive monitoring of liver stiffness, a surrogate for fibrosis, in children and young adults with AILD. TRIAL REGISTRATION.

Nevertheless, the role and mechanism of necroptosis-related lncRNAs in soft tissue sarcomas (STS) is so far unknown and needs to be explored further. Clinical and genomic data were obtained from the UCSC Xena database. All STS patients' subclusters were performed by unsupervised consensus clustering method based on the prognosis-specific lncRNAs, and then assessed their survival advantage and immune infiltrates. In addition, we explored the pathways and biological processes in subclusters through gene set enrichment analysis. At last, we established the necroptosis-related lncRNA-based risk signature (NRLncSig) using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) method, and explored the prediction performance and immune microenvironment of this signature in STS. A total of 911 normal soft tissue samples and 259 STS patients were included in current study. 39 prognosis-specific necroptosis-related lncRNAs were selected. Cluster 2 had a worse survival than the cluster 1 and characterized by different immune landscape in STS. A worse outcome in the high-risk group was observed by survival analysis and indicated an immunosuppressive microenvironment. The ROC curve analyses illustrated that the NRLncSig performing competitively in prediction of prognosis for STS patients. In addition, the nomogram presents excellent performance in predicting prognosis, which may be more beneficial towards STS patients' treatment. Our result indicated that the NRLncSig could be a good independent predictor of prognosis, and significantly connected with immune microenvironment, thereby providing new insights into the roles of necroptosis-related lncRNAs in STS.","20240418","Journal of cancer research and clinical oncology","Department of Bone and Joint Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University, Nanning, 530021, Guangxi, China."

The current gold standard for lung cancer analysis is based on the pathologists' interpretation of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E)-stained tissue slices viewed under a brightfield microscope or a digital slide scanner. Computational pathology using deep learning has been proposed to detect lung cancer on histology images. However, the histological staining workflow to acquire the H&E-stained images and the subsequent cancer diagnosis procedures are labor-intensive and time-consuming with tedious sample preparation steps and repetitive manual interpretation, respectively. In this work, we propose a weakly supervised learning method for LUAD classification on label-free tissue slices with virtual histological staining. The autofluorescence images of label-free tissue with histopathological information can be converted into virtual H&E-stained images by a weakly supervised deep generative model. For the downstream LUAD classification task, we trained the attention-based multiple-instance learning model with different settings on the open-source LUAD H&E-stained whole-slide images (WSIs) dataset from the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). The model was validated on the 150 H&E-stained WSIs collected from patients in Queen Mary Hospital and Prince of Wales Hospital with an average area under the curve (AUC) of 0.961. The model also achieved an average AUC of 0.973 on 58 virtual H&E-stained WSIs, comparable to the results on 58 standard H&E-stained WSIs with an average AUC of 0.977. The attention heatmaps of virtual H&E-stained WSIs and ground-truth H&E-stained WSIs can indicate tumor regions of LUAD tissue slices. In conclusion, the proposed diagnostic workflow on virtual H&E-stained WSIs of label-free tissue is a rapid, cost effective, and interpretable approach to assist clinicians in postoperative pathological examinations. The method could serve as a blueprint for other label-free imaging modalities and disease contexts.","20240407","Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc","Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Clear Water Bay, Kowloon, Hong Kong, China."

Macrophage galactose-binding lectin (MGL) coupled to 100 nm Eu3 + -nanoparticles was used to probe PSA captured from cancer cell lines, seminal plasma, and plasma samples from 249 patients with a clinical suspicion of prostate cancer onto 3 mm dense spots of free PSA antibody fab fragments. Results were compared to four kallikrein tests: tPSA, fPSA, iPSA and hK2. The fPSAMGLglycovariant provided superior discrimination of the GS ≥ 7 and benign + GS 6 groups (p 0.0003) compared to fPSA (NS). The corresponding AUC in ROC analysis was 0.70 compared to 0.66 for tPSA. In contrast to all four kallikrein tests, the fPSAMGLGV was independent of prostate gland volume. Using a logistic regression analysis the fPSAMGLGV significantly improved on the four-kallikrein model. Due to Eu-nanoparticles and a dense fPSA capture spot, the fPSAMGL glycovariant identifies an fPSA subform with the highest cancer specificity compared to the four conventional kallikreins.","20240425","Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry","Biotechnology Unit, Department of Life Technologies, University of Turku, Finland.

In recent years, the niche conservatism hypothesis has been widely debated, which is particularly evident in invasive biology research. Identifying the niche dynamics of P. solenopsis, as well as assessing its global invasion risk, is of both theoretical and practical importance. Based on 462 occurrence points and 19 bioclimatic variables, we used n-dimensional hypervolume analysis to quantify the multidimensional climatic niche of this pest in both its native and invasive ranges. We examined niche conservatism and further optimized the MaxEnt model parameters to predict the global invasion risk of P. solenopsis under both current and future climate conditions. Our findings indicated that the niche hypervolume of this pest in invasive ranges was significantly larger than that in its native ranges, with 99.45% of the niche differentiation contributed by niche expansion, with the remaining less than 1% explained by space replacement. Niche expansion was most evident in Oceania and Eurasia. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.83) and true skill statistic (0.62) indicated the model's robust performance. The areas of suitable habitats for P. solenopsis are increasing significantly and the northward spread is obvious in future climate change scenarios.

The multi-omics data is providing a new chance to explore collaborative biomarkers and corresponding diagnostic models of childhood asthma. To capture the nonlinear association of multi-omics data and improve interpretability of diagnostic model, we proposed a novel deep association model (DAM) and corresponding efficient analysis framework. First, the Deep Subspace Reconstruction was used to fuse the omics data and diagnostic information, thereby correcting the distribution of the original omics data and reducing the influence of unnecessary data noises. Second, the Joint Deep Semi-Negative Matrix Factorization was applied to identify different latent sample patterns and extract biomarkers from different omics data levels. Third, our newly proposed Deep Orthogonal Canonical Correlation Analysis can rank features in the collaborative module, which are able to construct the diagnostic model considering nonlinear correlation between different omics data levels. Using DAM, we deeply analyzed the transcriptome and methylation data of childhood asthma. The effectiveness of DAM is verified from the perspectives of algorithm performance and biological significance on the independent test dataset, by ablation experiment and comparison with many baseline methods from clinical and biological studies. The DAM-induced diagnostic model can achieve a prediction AUC of 0.912, which is higher than that of many other alternative methods. Meanwhile, relevant pathways and biomarkers of childhood asthma are also recognized to be collectively altered on the gene expression and methylation levels. As an interpretable machine learning approach, DAM simultaneously considers the non-linear associations among samples and those among biological features, which should help explore interpretative biomarker candidates and efficient diagnostic models from multi-omics data analysis for human complex diseases.","20240402","Fundamental research","Bio-Med Big Data Center, CAS Key Laboratory of Computational Biology, Shanghai Institute of Nutrition and Health, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Shanghai 200031, China."

The purpose of the current study was to examine whether pre-post shifts in preadolescent hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) activation could longitudinally predict internalizing outcomes and to determine whether BaSICS could buffer such HPA-related risk for psychopathology. Low-income youth (n = 112) ages 11-12 years were randomized to the 16-session intervention or assessment-only control (53% intervention; 54% female; 40% Hispanic, 63% Black, 20% White). Youth completed questionnaires and the Trier Social Stress Test, and provided cortisol via saliva at six timepoints during the 90-minute assessment. Adjusting for pre-intervention Cortisol Area Under the Curve-Ground (CAUCg) scores and internalizing problems, post-intervention CAUCg and intervention main and interactive effects were modeled as predictors of internalizing outcomes across post-intervention, 6-month, and 12-month follow-up assessments using multilevel regression methods.

Potencies to increase cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) were determined in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-K1 cells stably expressing human GCGR and GLP-1R. Agonism for endogenously expressed receptors was investigated in insulinoma cells (MIN6) for mouse GLP-1R, and in rat primary hepatocytes for the GCGR. In vivo potencies to engage the GLP-1R or GCGR were determined, measuring improvement in oral glucose tolerance (30 nmol/kg) and increase in plasma fibroblast growth factor-21 (FGF21) and liver nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT) mRNA expression (100 nmol/kg), respectively. Body weight- and glucose-lowering efficacies were investigated in diet-induced obese (DIO) mice and diabetic db/db mice, respectively. Upon acute dosing in lean mice, target engagement biomarkers for the GCGR and GLP-1R demonstrated a significant correlation (Spearman correlation coefficient with p < 0.05) to the in vitro GCGR and GLP-1R potencies for the 19 dual agonists investigated.

In this parallel group randomised controlled trial, patients on a waiting list for OS were randomised (no blinding, sealed envelopes) to either undergo surgery directly or undergo an LCD before surgery. At baseline and 4 weeks after surgery (n=15, 11 RYGB and 4 SG) or 4 weeks after the start of LCD (n=9), investigations were carried out, including an OGTT and hyperinsulinaemic-euglycaemic clamps during which concomitant simultaneous whole-body [18F]fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (PET)/MRI was performed. The primary outcome was HOMA-IR change. One month after bariatric surgery and initiation of LCD, both treatments induced similar reductions in body weight (mean ± SD: -7.7±1.4 kg and -7.4±2.2 kg, respectively), adipose tissue volume (7%) and liver fat content (2% units). HOMA-IR, a main endpoint, was significantly reduced following OS (-26.3% [95% CI -49.5, -3.0], p=0.009) and non-significantly following LCD (-20.9% [95% CI -58.2, 16.5). For both groups, there were similar reductions in triglycerides and LDL-cholesterol. Fasting plasma glucose and insulin were also significantly reduced only following OS. There was an increase in glucose AUC in response to an OGTT in the OS group (by 20%) but not in the LCD group. During hyperinsulinaemia, only the OS group showed a significantly increased PET-derived glucose uptake rate in skeletal muscle but a reduced uptake in the heart and abdominal adipose tissue. Both liver and brain glucose uptake rates were unchanged after surgery or LCD. Whole-body glucose disposal and endogenous glucose production were not significantly affected. The short-term metabolic effects seen 4 weeks after OS are not explained by loss of body fat alone. Thus OS, but not LCD, led to reductions in fasting plasma glucose and insulin resistance as well as to distinct changes in insulin-stimulated glucose fluxes to different tissues. Such effects may contribute to the prevention or reversal of type 2 diabetes following OS. Moreover, the full effects on whole-body insulin resistance and plasma glucose require a longer time than 4 weeks.

We conducted a retrospective longitudinal cohort study of the CF Foundation Patient Registry (N = 867 patients carrying the G551D mutation who were treated with ivacaftor from 2003 to 2018). The primary outcome was lung function (percent predicted forced expiratory volume in 1 s or FEV1pp). To characterize the association between ivacaftor initiation and lung function, we developed a dynamic prediction model through covariate selection of demographic and clinical characteristics. The ability of the selected model to predict a decline in lung function, clinically known as an FEV1-indicated exacerbation signal (FIES), was evaluated both at the population level and individual level. Based on the final model, the estimated improvement in FEV1pp after ivacaftor initiation was 4.89% predicted (95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.90 to 5.89). The rate of decline was reduced with ivacaftor initiation by 0.14% predicted/year (95% CI: 0.01 to 0.27). More frequent outpatient visits prior to study entry and being male corresponded to a higher overall FEV1pp. Pancreatic insufficiency, older age at study entry, a history of more frequent pulmonary exacerbations, lung infections, CF-related diabetes, and use of Medicaid insurance corresponded to lower FEV1pp. The model had excellent predictive accuracy for FIES events with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.83 (95% CI: 0.83 to 0.84) for the independent testing cohort and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.89 to 0.90) for 6-month forecasting with the masked cohort.

Models assessed combinations of clinical measurements: age at diagnosis, body mass index(mean = 26.6 kg/m2), sex(male = 64.9 %), Glutamic acid decarboxylase(GAD) antibody, serum cholesterol, serum triglycerides, and high-density lipoprotein(HDL) cholesterol. 67955 participants met inclusion criteria, of whom 0.8 % had T1D, which was markedly lower than model development cohorts. Model discrimination for clinical features was broadly similar in our Indian cohort compared to the European cohort: area under the receiver operating characteristic curve(AUC ROC) was 0.90 vs. 0.90 respectively, but was lower in the subset of young participants with measured GAD antibodies(n = 2404): and an AUC ROC of 0.87 when clinical features, sex, lipids and GAD antibodies were combined. All models substantially overestimated the likelihood of T1D, reflecting the lower prevalence of T1D in the Indian population. However, good model performance was achieved after recalibration by updating the model intercept and slope. Models for diabetes classification maintain the discrimination of T1D and T2D in this Indian population, where T2D is far more common, but require recalibration to obtain appropriate model probabilities. External validation and recalibration are needed before these tools can be used in non-European populations.","20240409","Diabetes & metabolic syndrome","Madras Diabetes Research Foundation, Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India; School of Public Health, SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Kattankulathur, Tamil Nadu, India.

Non-invasive fibrosis scores can be used to estimate the degree of fibrosis in liver disease patients, but most of these scores were developed in patients with viral hepatitis and without HCC. This study explored the ability of the Fibrosis-4 Index (FIB-4), the AST/Platelet Ratio Index (APRI), and the AST/ALT ratio to diagnose or exclude advanced fibrosis (METAVIR F3/4 versus F0-2) in patients with early-intermediate, potentially resectable HCC. We retrospectively reviewed 119 patients who underwent hepatic resection for HCC at a tertiary centre (2007-2019), 75 of whom had advanced fibrosis (prevalence 63%). Histological assessment of the surgical liver specimen was used as a reference standard for the degree of fibrosis. Overall diagnostic performance was highest for the FIB-4 Index, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.82, compared with 0.78 for APRI, and 0.56 for the AST/ALT ratio. Using established cut-off values, FIB-4 achieved a 90% positive predictive value at the higher cut-off (3.25) and a 90% negative predictive value at the lower cut-off (1.45).

Yet premature discontinuation undermines treatment effectiveness, increasing the risk of mortality and overdose. We developed and evaluated a machine learning (ML) framework for predicting buprenorphine care discontinuity within 12 months following treatment initiation. This retrospective study used United States (US) 2018-2021 MarketScan commercial claims data of insured individuals aged 18-64 who initiated buprenorphine between July 2018 and December 2020 with no buprenorphine prescriptions in the previous six months. We measured buprenorphine prescription discontinuation gaps of ≥30 days within 12 months of initiating treatment. We developed predictive models employing logistic regression, decision tree classifier, random forest, extreme gradient boosting, Adaboost, and random forest-extreme gradient boosting ensemble. We applied recursive feature elimination with cross-validation to reduce dimensionality and identify the most predictive features while maintaining model robustness. For model validation, we used several statistics to evaluate performance, such as C-statistics and precision-recall curves. We focused on two distinct treatment stages: at the time of treatment initiation and one and three months after treatment initiation. We employed SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis that helped us explain the contributions of different features in predicting buprenorphine discontinuation. We stratified patients into risk subgroups based on their predicted likelihood of treatment discontinuation, dividing them into decile subgroups. Additionally, we used a calibration plot to analyze the reliability of the models. A total of 30,373 patients initiated buprenorphine and 14.98% (4551) discontinued treatment. C-statistic varied between 0.56 and 0.76 for the first-stage models including patient-level demographic and clinical variables. Inclusion of proportion of days covered (PDC) measured after one month and three months following treatment initiation significantly increased the models' discriminative power (C-statistics: 0.60 to 0.82). Random forest (C-statistics: 0.76, 0.79 and 0.82 with baseline predictors, one-month PDC and three-months PDC, respectively) outperformed other ML models in discriminative performance in all stages (C-statistics: 0.56 to 0.77). Most influential risk factors of discontinuation included early stage medication adherence, age, and initial days of supply. ML algorithms demonstrated a good discriminative power in identifying patients at higher risk of buprenorphine care discontinuity.

However, the specific role of ferroptosis-related genes (FRGs) in Alzheimer's disease (AD) is not yet fully understood. The aim of the study was to detect ferroptosis related genes with regulatory functions in the disease and explore potential mechanisms in AD. Hub FRGs were obtained through multiple algorithms based on the GSE5281 dataset. The screening process was implemented by R packages including limma, WGCNA, glm and SVM-RFE. Gene Ontology classification and pathway enrichment analysis were performed based on FRGs. Biological processes involved with hub FRGs were investigated through GSVA and GSEA methods. Immune infiltration analysis was performed by the R package CIBERSORT. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was utilized to validate the accuracy of hub FRGs. The CeRNA network attempted to find non-coding RNA transcripts which may play a role in disease progression. DDIT4, MUC1, KLHL24, CD44, and RB1 were identified as hub FRGs. As later revealed by enrichment analysis, the hub FRGs had important effects on AD through involvement in diverse AD pathogenesis-related pathways such as autophagy and glutathione metabolism. The immune microenvironment in AD shows increased numbers of resting NK cells, macrophages, and mast cells, with decreased levels of CD8 T cells when compared to healthy samples. Regulatory T cells were positively correlated with MUC1, KLHL24, and DDIT4 expression, while RB1 showed negative correlations with eosinophils and CD8 T cells, suggesting potential roles in modulating the immune environment in AD. Our research has identified five hub FRGs in AD.

For ASES, PROMIS PF, and PROMIS PI, the calculated MCID 95% CI all crossed 0 (theoretically invalid). Using the baseline-adjusted ROC curve MCID calculation, the MCID estimates for SANE, ASES, and PROMIS PI were both statistically and theoretically valid if the baseline score was less than 70.5, 69, and 65.7. When MCIDs were calculated and anchored to the results of standard, anchor-based MCID, a standard ROC curve analysis did not yield statistically or theoretically valid results across a battery of PROMs commonly used to assess outcomes after shoulder surgery in the active duty military population.

AI-FR diagnosis models were trained for each disease using three algorithms: support vector machine (SVM), principal component analysis k-nearest neighbor (PCA-KNN), and adaptive boosting (AdaBoost). Diagnostic performance was evaluated. Optimal efficacy was achieved as the best index among the three models. Effect factors of AI-FR diagnosis were explored with regression analysis. 462 cases of 10 endocrine and metabolic syndromes and 2310 controls were included into the facial image database. The AI-FR diagnostic models showed diagnostic accuracies of 0.827-0.920 with SVM, 0.766-0.890 with PCA-KNN, and 0.818-0.935 with AdaBoost. Higher dFRI was associated with higher optimal area under the curve (AUC) (P = 0.035). No significant correlation was observed between the sample size of the training set and diagnostic performance. A multi-ethnic, multi-regional, and multi-disease facial database for 10 endocrine and metabolic syndromes was built.

This demographic shift underscores the need for improved understanding and prediction of complications during pregnancy in this specific ACHD population. Despite progress in maternal cardiac risk assessment, the prediction of neonatal outcomes for ACHD pregnancies remains underdeveloped. Therefore, the aims of this study are to assess neonatal outcomes in a CHD women population, to identify their predictive factors and to propose a new risk score for predicting neonatal complications. This registry study included all women born between 1975 and 1996 diagnosed with ACHD who underwent at least one cardiology consultation for ACHD in Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc. A multivariate analysis was performed to identify predictors of neonatal complications and these were incorporated into a new risk index. Its validity was assessed using bootstrap method. This score was then compared with scores adapted from the ZAHARA and CARPREG studies for offspring events prediction. Analysis of 491 pregnancies revealed 31.4% of neonatal complications. Four significant predictors of adverse neonatal outcomes were identified: cardiac treatment during pregnancy (OR 14.8, 95%CI [3.4-66]), hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (OR 11.4, 95%CI [3.4-39.0]), smoking during pregnancy (OR 10.6, 95%CI [2.8-40.6]), and pre-pregnancy BMI <18.5 kg/m² (OR 6.5, 95%CI [2.5-16.5]). The risk model demonstrated an AUC of 0.70 (95%CI [0.65-0.75]), which remained stable after bootstrap validation. This model significantly outperformed the scores adapted from ZAHARA and CARPREG data. Based on the regression coefficients, a risk score was subsequently developed comprising five risk categories. One third of ACHD pregnancies are complicated by poor neonatal outcome. These complications are determined by four independent factors relating to the cardiac and non-cardiac status of the patients, which have been incorporated into a risk score. Our study is one of the first to propose a predictive risk score of neonatal outcomes in ACHD pregancies, and paves the way for other validation and confirmation studies.","20240426","American heart journal","Cardiovascular Department, Cliniques Universitaires Saint-Luc, Brussels, Belgium; Pôle de Recherche Cardiovasculaire (CARD), Institut de Recherche Expérimentale et Clinique (IREC), Université Catholique de Louvain (UCLouvain), Brussels, Belgium."

We compared ECG abnormality prevalences using the Minnesota Code between survivors and siblings, and within biplane left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) categories. Among 880 survivors who received anthracycline, mitoxantrone or heart radiotherapy, logistic regression models using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator identified ECG abnormalities associated with three abnormal LVEF categories (<52% in male/<54% in female, <50% and <45%). We assessed the overall contribution of these ECG abnormalities to clinical regression models predicting abnormal LVEF, assuming an absence of systolic dysfunction with a <1% threshold probability. 16% of survivors (52% female, mean age 34.7 years) and 14% of siblings had major ECG abnormalities.

Among the three training datasets, a total of 84 common dysregulated immune-related genes (IRGs) were identified. Utilizing a within-sample relative expression ordering (REOs)-based algorithm to analyze these common IRGs, differential characteristics were observed in three reverse stable pairs (ELANE-RORA, IL18RAP-CD247, and IL1R1-CD28). In the eight GEO datasets, the expression of ELANE, IL18RAP, and IL1R1 demonstrated significant upregulation, while RORA, CD247, and CD28 expression exhibited notable downregulation during sepsis. These three pairs of immune-related marker genes displayed accuracies of 95.89% and 97.99% in distinguishing sepsis samples among the eight GEO datasets and the three independent ArrayExpress datasets, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ranged from 0.81 to 1.0. Additionally, among these three immune-related marker gene pairs, mRNA expression levels of ELANE and IL1R1 were upregulated, whereas the levels of CD247 and CD28 mRNA were downregulated in blood samples from patients with sepsis compared to normal controls. These three immune-related marker gene pairs exhibit high predictive performance for blood samples from patients with sepsis. They hold potential as valuable auxiliary clinical blood screening tools for sepsis.","20240403","Heliyon","Department of Anesthesiology, The Second Xiangya Hospital, Central South University, Changsha, 410011, China."

Through retrospective recruitment, a training cohort of 683 CC patients was created, and a validation cohort of 332 CC patients was prospectively recruited. ROIs were delineated using three different methods to measure the mean ADC (ADCmean), single-section ADC (ADCss), and the minimum ADC of tumors (ADCmin). Logistic regression was employed to identify independent factors related to PD-L1 expression. A nomogram was drawn based on ADC values combined with clinicopathological features, its discrimination and calibration performances were estimated using the area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic and calibration curve. The clinical benefits were evaluated by decision curve analysis. The ADCmin independently correlated with PD-L1 expression. The nomogram constructed with ADCmin and other independent clinicopathological-related factors: FIGO staging, pathological grade, parametrial invasion, and lymph node status demonstrated excellent diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.912 and 0.903, respectively), good calibration capacities, and greater net benefits compared to the clinicopathological model in both the training and validation cohorts. ADCmin independently correlated PD-L1 expression, and the nomogram established with ADCmin and clinicopathological independent prognostic factors had a strong predictive performance for PD-L1 expression, thereby serving as a promising tool for selecting cases eligible for immunotherapy. The minimum ADC can serve as a reliable imaging biomarker related to PD-L1 expression; the established nomogram combines the minimum ADC and clinicopathological factors that can assist clinical immunotherapy decisions.","20240418","European radiology","College of Clinical Medicine, Ningxia Medical University, Yinchuan, P.R.

The response to the intervention was evaluated in terms of reduction of OGTT-glucose concentration. Clusters' validation was done in the prospective EGIR-RISC cohort (n = 1538). Four replicable clusters with different glycemic and metabolomic profiles were identified. Individuals had similar weight loss, but improvement in glycemic profile and β-cell function was different among clusters, highly depending on pre-intervention insulin response to OGTT. Pre-intervention high insulin response was associated with the best improvement in AUC-G, while clusters with low AUC-I and iAUC I/G showed no beneficial effect of weight loss on glucose control, as also confirmed by the logistic regression model.

Methods: The study included a total of 552 children/adolescents with severe obesity (BMI: 36.4 [32.7-40.7] kg/m2; 219 males, 333 females; age: 14.8 [12.9-16.3] years), who were further subdivided based on the presence or absence of metabolic syndrome (MetS+ and MetS respectively). Results: The MHR, LHR, and NHR indexes (p < 0.0001), but not SIRI (p = 0.524), were significantly higher in the MetS+ compared to the MetS- subgroup, showing a positive correlation with the degree of MetS severity (p < 0.0001).

Ki-67 immunohistochemistry was performed on small biopsy/cytology specimens from pulmonary carcinoid tumors (n=139), and labeling index was scored via automated image analysis of at least 500 cells. OTP immunohistochemistry was performed on 70 cases with sufficient tissue and scored as positive or negative (<20% tumor nuclei staining). Higher Ki-67 index was associated with worse disease-specific progression-free survival (ds-PFS), with 3% and 4% thresholds having similarly strong associations with ds-PFS ( P <0.001, hazard ratio ≥11). Three-year ds-PFS was 98% for patients with Ki-67 <3% and 89% for patients with Ki-67≥3% ( P =0.0006). The optimal Ki-67 threshold for prediction of typical versus atypical carcinoid histology on subsequent resection was 3.21 (AUC 0.68). Negative OTP staining approached significance with atypical carcinoid histology ( P =0.06) but not with ds-PFS ( P =0.24, hazard ratio=3.45), although sample size was limited.

Identification of a 3% hot-spot Ki-67 threshold as optimal for prediction of ds-PFS is notable as a 3% Ki-67 threshold is currently used for gastrointestinal neuroendocrine tumor stratification, allowing consideration of a unified classification system across organ systems.","20240408","The American journal of surgical pathology","Departments of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology."

K-means clustering was used to identify patient clusters. Multivariate and lasso regression was used to identify relevant predictors compared to a COVID-19 positive control group. Predictors of long-term COVID included older age, Western ethnicity, BMI, chronic disease, COVID-19 reinfections, severity, and symptoms, lower self-esteem, and higher positive affect (AUC = 0.79, 95%CI 0.73-0.86). Four clusters were identified: a low and a high symptom severity cluster, a smell-taste and respiratory symptoms cluster, and a neuro-cognitive, psychosocial, and inflammatory symptom cluster. Predictors for the different clusters included regular health complaints, healthcare use, fear of COVID-19, anxiety, depressive symptoms, and neuroticism.

NfL, GFAP, UCHL1 and tTAU concentrations in serum and CSF were measured in 183 patients (122 with neuroinflammatory disease and 61 neurological or somatoform disease controls) using the single molecule array HD-1 analyzer (Quanterix, Boston, MA). Spearman's rank correlations were computed between serum and CSF concentrations. In a second step, the effects of age, BMI, gadolinium-enhancing lesions in MRI, integrity of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and presence of acute relapse were accounted for by computing partial correlations. The analyses were repeated for a subsample consisting of MS phenotype patients only (n = 118). EDSS, MS disease activity and acute relapse were considered as additional covariates. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed for each serum/CSF biomarker concentration to assess how well the particular biomarker concentration differentiates MS patients from somatoform disease controls. Correlations between serum and CSF levels as well as area under the curve (AUC) values were compared for the different biomarkers using z-test statistics. Serum concentrations correlated positively with CSF levels for NfL (r = 0.705, p < 0.01) as well as for GFAP (r = 0.259, p < 0.01). Correlation coefficients were significantly higher for NfL than for GFAP (z = 5.492, p < 0.01). We found no significant serum-CSF correlations for UCHL1 or tTAU. After adjusting for covariates, the results remained unchanged. In the analysis focusing only on MS patients, the results were replicated. ROC analysis demonstrated similarly acceptable performance of serum and CSF NfL values in differentiating MS phenotype patients from somatoform disease controls. AUC values were significantly higher for serum and CSF NfL compared to other biomarkers. NfL and GFAP but not UCHL1 or tTAU serum concentrations are associated with CSF levels of the respective biomarker. NfL exhibits more robust correlations between its serum and CSF concentrations as compared to GFAP independently from BBB integrity, clinical and radiological covariates.

Graft diameter can be predicted in a numerically continuous manner as √[2*(AB + CD)], where A and B are the semitendinosus cross-sectional length and breath, respectively, and C and D are the gracilis cross-sectional length and breath, respectively. A moderately positive correlation exists between the predicted and actual graft diameter (r = 0.661 and p < .001). Our method yields a high specificity of 92.6% and a moderate sensitivity of 67.2% if we define an adequate actual graft size as ≥ 8 mm.

However, most of them require high-density EEG, which is burdensome to the patients for daily monitoring. Moreover, prevailing seizure models require extensive training with significant labeled data which is very time-consuming and demanding for the epileptologists. To address these challenges, here we propose an adaptive channel selection strategy and a semi-supervised deep learning model respectively to reduce the number of EEG channels and to limit the amount of labeled data required for accurate seizure prediction. Our channel selection module is centered on features from EEG power spectra parameterization that precisely characterize the epileptic activities to identify the seizure-associated channels for each patient. The semi-supervised model integrates generative adversarial networks and bidirectional long short-term memory networks to enhance seizure prediction. Our approach is evaluated on the CHB-MIT and Siena epilepsy datasets. With utilizing only 4 channels, the method demonstrates outstanding performance with an AUC of 93.15% on the CHB-MIT dataset and an AUC of 88.98% on the Siena dataset. Experimental results also demonstrate that our selection approach reduces the model parameters and training time. Adaptive channel selection coupled with semi-supervised learning can offer the possible bases for a light weight and computationally efficient seizure prediction system, making the daily monitoring practical to improve patients' quality of life.","20240423","Computers in biology and medicine","School of Biomedical Engineering, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, 510515, China; Guangdong Provincial Key Laboratory of Medical Image Processing, Southern Medical University, Guangzhou, China."

The GLIM diagnosis relies on weight loss information, and bias or even failure to recall patients' historical weight can cause misestimates of malnutrition. We aimed to compare the suitability of several screening tools in GLIM diagnosis, and establish machine learning (ML) models to predict malnutrition in CRC patients without weight loss information. This multicenter cohort study enrolled 4487 CRC patients. The capability of GLIM diagnoses combined with four screening tools in predicting survival probability was compared by Kaplan-Meier curves, and the most accurate one was selected as the malnutrition reference standard. Participants were randomly assigned to a training cohort (n = 3365) and a validation cohort (n = 1122). Several ML approaches were adopted to establish models for predicting malnutrition without weight loss data. We estimated feature importance and reserved the top 30% of variables for retraining simplified models. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated to assess and compare model performance. NRS-2002 was the most suitable screening tool for GLIM diagnosis in CRC patients, with the highest hazard ratio (1.59; 95% CI, 1.43-1.77).

The initial step in vulnerability assessment involves exposure assessment, which entails quantifying and mapping the risks posed by multiple environmental hazards, thereby offering valuable insights for the implementation of vulnerability assessment methodologies. Consequently, this study sought to model the exposure of coupled social-ecological systems in mountainous regions to various environmental hazards. By a set of socio-economic, climatic, geospatial, hydrological, and demographic data, as well as satellite imagery, and examining 11 hazards, including droughts, pests, dust storms, winds, extreme temperatures, evapotranspiration, landslides, floods, wildfires, and social vulnerability, this research employed machine learning (ML) techniques and the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP). Expert opinions were utilized to guide hazard weighting and calculate the exposure index (EI). Through the precise spatial mapping of EI variations across the socio-ecological systems in mountainous areas, this investigation provides insights into vulnerability to multiple environmental hazards, thereby laying the groundwork for future endeavors in supporting national-level vulnerability assessments aimed at fostering sustainable environments. The findings reveal that social vulnerability and pests receive the highest weighting, while floods and landslides are ranked lower. All hazards demonstrate significant correlations with the EI, with droughts exhibiting the strongest correlation (r > 0.81). Spatial analysis indicates a north-south gradient in forest exposure, with southern regions showing higher exposure hotspots (EI 29.08) compared to northern areas (EI 10.60). Validation based on Area Under Curve (AUC) and Consistency Rate (CR) in FAHP demonstrates robustness, with AUC values exceeding 0.78 and CR values below 0.1.

Both pMMR&MSS and dMMR&MSS groups experienced significantly shorter overall survival (OS) than those in dMMR by IHC and MSI-H by MSI-PCR (dMMR&MSI-H) group (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.429, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.89-3.116, p < .01; HR = 21.96, 95% CI: 7.24-66.61, p < .01). The dMMR&MSS group experienced shorter OS than the pMMR&MSS group, but the difference did not reach significance (log rank test, p = .0686). In the immunotherapy group, the progression-free survival of dMMR&MSS patients was significantly shorter than that of dMMR&MSI-H patients (HR = 13.83, 95% CI: 1.508-126.8, p < .05). The ZS6Y-MSI-Pre nomogram (C-index = 0.816, 95% CI: 0.792-0.841, already online) found 66% (2/3) dMMR&MSS patients in the ZS6Y-2 cohort. There are significant differences in OS and immunotherapy effect between dMMR&MSI-H and dMMR&MSS patients. Our prediction model provides an economical way to screen dMMR&MSS patients.","20240409","International journal of cancer","Department of Pathology, The Sixth Affiliated Hospital, Sun Yat-sen University, Guangzhou, China."

We performed the current research as to develop an easily accessible and applicable model to predict half-marathon performance in male recreational half-marathon runners by nomogram. Male recreational half-marathon runners in Zhejiang Province, China were recruited. A set of literature-based and panel-reviewed questionnaires were used to assess the epidemiological conditions of the recruited runners. Descriptive and binary regression analyses were done for the profiling and identification of predictors related to higher half-marathon performance (completing time ≤ 105 min). Participants were assigned to the training set (n = 141) and the testing set (n = 61) randomly. A nomogram was used to visually predict the half-marathon performance, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) was used to evaluate the predictive ability of the nomogram. A total of 202 participants (median age: 49 years; higher half-marathon performance: 33.7%) were included. After multivariate analysis, three variables remained as significant predictors: longer monthly running distance [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 0.992, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.988 to 0.996, p < 0.001], faster mean training pace (AOR = 2.151, 95% CI: 1.275 to 3.630, p < 0.001), and better sleep quality [the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), AOR = 2.390, 95% CI: 1.164 to 4.907, p = 0.018]. The AUC of the training and testing sets in nomogram were 0.750 and 0.743, respectively. Further ternary and linear regression analyses corroborated the primary findings. This study developed a nomogram with good potential to predict the half-marathon performance of recreational runners. Our results suggest that longer monthly running distance, faster mean training pace and better sleep quality notably contribute to better half-marathon performance.","20240429","BMC sports science, medicine & rehabilitation","Department of Radiology, Shaoxing people's Hospital (Shaoxing Hospital of Zhejiang University), Shaoxing, China."

Adults with ileal CD using biologic therapy at a tertiary care center underwent ML analysis of CTE scans. Two fellowship-trained radiologists graded bowel injury severity at granular spatial increments along the ileum (1 cm), called mini-segments. ML segmentation methods were trained on radiologist grading with predicted severity and then spatially mapped to the ileum. Cumulative injury was calculated as the sum (S-CIDSS) and mean of severity grades along the ileum. Multivariate models of future small bowel resection were compared with cumulative ileum injury metrics and traditional bowel measures, adjusting for laboratory values, medications, and prior surgery at the time of CTE. In 229 CTE scans, 8,424 mini-segments underwent analysis. Agreement between ML and radiologists injury grading was strong (κ = 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.79-0.81) and similar to inter-radiologist agreement (κ = 0.87, 95% confidence interval 0.85-0.88). S-CIDSS (46.6 vs 30.4, P = 0.0007) and mean cumulative injury grade scores (1.80 vs 1.42, P < 0.0001) were greater in CD biologic users that went to future surgery. Models using cumulative spatial metrics (area under the curve = 0.76) outperformed models using conventional bowel measures, laboratory values, and medical history (area under the curve = 0.62) for predicting future surgery in biologic users. Automated cumulative ileal injury scores show promise for improving prediction of outcomes in small bowel CD.

Little is known on the new score's performance regarding other bleeding risk in AF. We studied 14,672 patients diagnosed with AF between 2014 and 2018. During follow-up, we assessed the performance of DOAC score compared with the HASBLED, ORBIT and SWISS scores at predicting major bleeding in DOACs and non-DOACs users. Discrimination, calibration and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to assess the risk scorer's performance. There were 1484 (10.1%) patients on DOACs, 9730 on vitamin K antagonist (VKA), and 3458 on non-oral anticoagulants. Over a median of 3.5 years of follow-up, 79 major bleedings occurred in the DOAC patients, and 486 in the VKA patients (cumulative incidences = 7.4 and 13.9 per 100 patient-years, respectively). Amongst the DOAC patients, the DOAC score discrimination was moderate (C-statistic = 0.711), but significantly higher than HASBLED (C = 0.640; p = 0.03), ORBIT (C = 0.660; p = 0.04), and SWISS scores (C = 0.637; p = 0.002). The DCA showed higher net benefit using DOAC score compared with the remaining scores. In the VKA patients, DOAC score showed the highest discrimination (c-statistic = 0.709), followed by ORBIT (C = 0.692; p = 0.07), HASBLED and SWISS (C = 0.635 and 0.624, respectively; p < 0.01). All risk scores calibrated well, although HASBLED showed relatively poor calibration. The new DOAC bleeding risk score is a valid and reasonable predictor of major bleeding over a median of 3.5 years of follow-up.

Bariatric surgery, such as sleeve gastrectomy (SG), shows promise in improving the unfavorable condition of MAFLD. Transient elastography (TE) can be utilized to assess the extent of steatosis and liver fibrosis, providing a noninvasive method for preoperative prediction and postoperative evaluation of MAFLD. This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of TE in diagnosing MAFLD by evaluating liver steatosis and tissue stiffness, as well as assessing the early impact of SG in the treatment of obesity-associated MAFLD. In this study, the authors collected preoperative and 6-month postoperative data from patients with obesity who were diagnosed with MAFLD by intraoperative liver biopsy. The patients underwent SG at our hospital between August 2021 and April 2023. The authors estimated the diagnostic accuracy for the steatosis and fibrosis categories using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). The authors also evaluated the influence of disease prevalence on the positive predictive value and negative predictive value. MAFLD diagnosis was based on the liver steatosis activity and fibrosis scoring system. The authors used univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses to identify factors contributing to severe MAFLD. To visualize the results, the authors created a nomogram and enhanced it with bootstrap resampling for internal validation. Additionally, the authors plotted receiver operating characteristic and calibration curves. The authors compared preoperative and postoperative data, including general information, laboratory tests, and TE results, to assess the early impact of SG in the treatment of obesity-associated MAFLD. Based on the results of liver biopsy, the AUROC for controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) in identifying steatosis was found to be 0.843 (95% CI: 0.729-0.957) for S≥S1, 0.863 (95% CI: 0.786-0.940) for S≥S2, and 0.872 (95% CI: 0.810-0.934) for S=S3. The Youden limits for S≥S1, S≥S2, and S≥S3 were determined to be 271 dB/m, 292 dB/m, and 301 dB/m, respectively. Similarly, the AUROC for liver stiffness measurement (LSM)/E in detecting liver fibrosis was 0.927 (95% CI: 0.869-0.984) for F≥F2, 0.919 (95% CI: 0.824-0.979) for F≥F3, and 0.949 (95% CI: 0.861-0.982) for F=F4, with Youden cutoff values of 7.5 kPa, 8.3 kPa, and 10.4 kPa, respectively. Patients with A≥3 and/or F≥3 were classified as having severe MAFLD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis identified CAP, E, LDL, and AST as the best diagnostic factors for severe MAFLD, and a nomogram was constructed based on these factors. The AUROC of the nomogram for the assessment of severe MAFLD was 0.824 (95% CI: 0.761-0.887), which was further validated by 1000 bootstrap resamplings with a bootstrap model area under curve of 0.823. Finally, after a 6-month follow-up period, the steatosis grade and fibrosis stage of the patients were graded based on the optimal cutoff values for CAP and LSM. Significant reductions in BMI, waist circumference, HbA1c, fasting glycemia, triglycerides, high density lipoprotein (HDL), glutamic pyruvic transaminase (ALT), glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (AST), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), CAP, LSM, steatosis grade, and fibrosis stage were observed compared to the preoperative values. In this prospective study, the authors investigated the use of CAP and LSM as alternatives to liver biopsy for evaluating hepatic steatosis and fibrosis in patients with obesity combined with MAFLD. Furthermore, the authors examined the impact of SG on metabolic indicators and the progression of fatty liver disease during the early postoperative period, and observed significant improvements in both aspects.","20240401","International journal of surgery (London, England)","Department of Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery, The First Affiliated Hospital of Jinan University."

Saliva samples were collected at early and late pregnancy, and microbiome profiles were analyzed through 16S rRNA gene sequencing. The relative abundance of Streptococcus was over-represented (median 0.259 vs. 0.116) and Saccharibacteria_TM7 was under-represented (median 0.033 vs. 0.068) in the LBW case group than in controls (p < 0.001, p = 0.015 respectively). Ten species were identified as microbiome biomarkers of LBW by LEfSe analysis, which included 7 species within the genus of Streptococcus or as part of 'nutritionally variant streptococci' (NVS), 2 species of opportunistic pathogen Leptotrichia buccalis and Gemella sanguinis (all LDA score>3.5) as risk biomarkers, and one species of Saccharibacteria TM7 as a beneficial biomarker (LDA= -4.5). The machine-learning model based on these 10 distinguished oral microbiota species could predict LBW, with an accuracy of 82 %, sensitivity of 91 %, and specificity of 73 % (AUC-ROC score 0.89, 95 % CI: 0.75-1.0). Results of α-diversity showed that mothers who delivered LBW infants had less stable salivary microbiota construction throughout pregnancy than the control group (measured by Shannon, p = 0.048; and Pielou's, p = 0.021), however the microbiome diversity did not improve the prediction accuracy of LBW. A machine-learning oral microbiome model shows promise in predicting low-birth-weight delivery. Even in cases where oral health is not significantly compromised, opportunistic pathogens or rarer taxa associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes can still be identified in the oral cavity. This study highlights the potential complexity of the relationship between oral microbiome and pregnancy outcomes, indicating that mechanisms underlying the association between oral microbiota and adverse pregnancy outcomes may involve complex interactions between host factors, microbiota, and systemic conditions. Using machine learning to develop a predictive model based on specific oral microbiota biomarkers provides a potential for personalized medicine approaches.

This study aimed to assess the feasibility of machine learning algorithms for predicting cerebral infarction after revascularization surgery in patients with MMD. This retrospective study was conducted across two centers and harnessed data from 512 patients with MMD who had undergone revascularization surgery. The patient cohort was partitioned into internal and external datasets. Using perioperative clinical data from the internal cohort, three distinct machine learning algorithms-namely the support vector machine, random forest, and light gradient-boosting machine models-were trained and cross-validated to predict the occurrence of postoperative cerebral infarction. Predictive performance validity was subsequently assessed using an external dataset. Shapley additive explanations (SHAP) analysis was conducted to augment the prediction model's transparency and to quantify the impact of each input variable on shaping both the aggregate and individual patient predictions. In the cohort of 512 patients, 33 (6.4%) experienced postrevascularization cerebral infarction. The cross-validation outcomes revealed that, among the three models, the support vector machine model achieved the largest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) at mean ± SD 0.785 ± 0.052. Notably, during external validation, the light gradient-boosting machine model exhibited the highest accuracy at 0.903 and the largest ROC-AUC at 0.710. The top-performing prediction model utilized five input variables: postoperative serum gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase value, positive posterior cerebral artery (PCA) involvement on preoperative MRA, infarction as the rationale for surgery, presence of an infarction scar on preoperative MRI, and preoperative modified Rankin Scale score. Furthermore, the SHAP analysis identified presence of PCA involvement, infarction as the rationale for surgery, and presence of an infarction scar on preoperative MRI as positive influences on postoperative cerebral infarction. This study indicates the usefulness of employing machine learning techniques with routine perioperative data to predict the occurrence of cerebral infarction after revascularization procedures in patients with MMD.","20240405","Journal of neurosurgery","1Department of Neurosurgery, Nagoya University Graduate School of Medicine, Nagoya, Aichi."

A spatial database incorporating dust occurrence areas was created using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images from 2002 to 2022, including 15 influential criteria related to climate, soil, topography, and land cover. Four models were employed for modeling and DSM generation: TabNet, TabNet-PSO, TabNet-GWO, and TabNet-HGS. Evaluation of the modeling results using performance metrics indicated that the TabNet-HGS model outperformed the other models in both training (mean absolute error (MAE) = 0.055, root-mean-square error (RMSE) = 0.1, coefficient of determination (R2) = 0.959), and testing (MAE = 0.063, RMSE = 0.114, R2 = 0.947) data. Following TabNet-HGS, the TabNet-PSO, TabNet-GWO, and TabNet models demonstrated progressively lower accuracy. The validation of the DSM was performed by assessing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, revealing that the TabNet-HGS, TabNet-PSO, TabNet-GWO, and TabNet models exhibited the highest modeling accuracy, with corresponding area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.994, 0.986, 0.98, and 0.832, respectively. These results highlight the enhanced accuracy of dust susceptibility modeling achieved by integrating swarm-based metaheuristic algorithms with the TabNet model. The dust susceptibility map provides valuable insights into the sources, pathways, and impacts of dust particles on the environment and human health in the study area.","20240425","Journal of environmental management","Dept. of Computer Science & Engineering and Convergence Engineering for Intelligent Drone, XR Research Center, Sejong University, Seoul, Republic of Korea.

Somatic mutations in plasma samples were identified using a customized 128-gene capture panel with next-generation sequencing. The correlation between early change in ctDNA levels and treatment response or long-term clinical outcomes was assessed. 37 of 72 (51.4%) patients harbored detectable ctDNA alterations at baseline. Patients with complete response showed a larger decrease in ctDNA levels during PST. The median relative change of variant allele fraction (VAF) was -97.4%, -46.7%, and +21.1% for patients who subsequently had a complete response (n = 11), partial response (n = 11), and no response (n = 15) (p = 0.0012), respectively. In addition, the relative change of VAF between the pretreatment and first on-treatment blood draw exhibited the optimal predictive value to tumor response after PST (area under the curve, AUC = 0.7448, p = 0.02). More importantly, early change of ctDNA levels during treatment have significant prognostic value for patients with BC, there was a significant correlation between early decrease of VAF and longer recurrence-free survival compared to those with an VAF increase (HR = 12.54; 95% CI, 2.084 to 75.42, p = 0.0063).

The purpose of this paper is to investigate whether Cisternostomy prevents the occurrence of PTH in patients with moderate and severe TBI. A retrospective analysis of clinical data of 86 patients with moderate and severe TBI from May 2019 to October 2021 was carried out in the Brain Trauma Center of Tianjin Huanhu Hospital. Univariate analysis was performed to examine the gender, age, preoperative Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score, preoperative Rotterdam CT score, decompressive craniectomy rate, intracranial infection rate, the incidence of subdural fluid, and incidence of hydrocephalus in patients between the Cisternostomy group and the non-Cisternostomy surgery group. we also analyzed the clinical outcome indicators like GCS at discharge,6 month GOS-E and GOS-E ≥ 5 in two groups.Additionaly, the preoperative GCS score, decompressive craniectomy rate, age, and gender of patients with PTH and non hydrocephalus were compared. Further multifactorial logistic binary regression was performed to explore the risk factors for PTH. Finally, we conducted ROC curve analysis on the statistically significant results from the univariate regression analysis to predict the ability of each risk factor to cause PTH.

However, differences in the severity and distribution patterns of lower extremity nerve enlargement have not been established for either disease. Therefore, we examined the utility of lower extremity nerve ultrasonography for differentiating between CMT and CIDP. Twelve patients with demyelinating CMT and 17 patients with CIDP were evaluated. The median, ulnar, tibial, and fibular nerves were evaluated in three regions: the distal upper extremity, intermediate upper extremity, and lower extremity. Of the 14 selected screening sites, the number of sites that exhibited nerve enlargement (enlargement site number, ESN) in each region was determined.

The current traditional methods for identifying accounting fraud rely on manual review and judgment, lacking objectivity and accuracy. In order to improve the accuracy of accounting fraud identification, improve identification efficiency and objectivity, this article combines smart city information technology to conduct in-depth research on data mining algorithms for accounting fraud identification. This article first provides a brief overview of smart cities and information technology, then introduces the basic theory of accounting fraud identification, and finally implements accounting fraud identification through k-means clustering mining algorithm. The data is divided into k clusters, and abnormal clusters are identified by checking the characteristics and attributes of each cluster. Compared with traditional rule-based and pattern based methods, this approach can more flexibly adapt to different types and forms of fraud, and can discover unknown patterns of fraud. In the experiment, this article used electronic data collection, analysis, and retrieval systems on the websites of the Shanghai Stock Exchange and Shenzhen Stock Exchange to collect 641 annual reports and financial characteristics from 62 listed companies that engaged in financial statement fraud and 84 companies that were not reported to have financial statement fraud from 2012 to 2021 as test samples. The results were tested and analyzed from several aspects, including the number of misjudgments, misjudgment rate, and ROC curve. The final test results show that compared to traditional accounting fraud identification methods, the comprehensive misjudgment rate of data mining algorithms based on smart cities has decreased by 3 %.

It is also important to determine which patients would benefit from Surgical Stabilisation of Rib Fractures (SSRF). This study aims to validate two scoring systems (RibScore and SCARF score) in predicting complications and association with SSRF in an Australian trauma population. Clinical observation suggests that complications and criteria for SSRF is associated with anatomical and physiological factors. Therefore it is hypothesized that utilisation of an anatomical (RibScore) and physiological (SCARF) in conjunction will have improved predictive ability. Retrospective cohort study of rib fracture patients admitted to an Australian Level I trauma centre from Jan 2017 to Jan 2021. RibScore and SCARF score were calculated. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine risk factors associated with complications and SSRF, as well the scoring systems' ability via ROC AUC. 1157 patients were included. Higher median RibScore (1vs0; p < 0.001) and SCARF score (3vs1, p < 0.001) was associated with development of complications. Similarly for SSRF, RibScore (3vs0; p < 0.001), SCARF score (3vs1; p < 0.001) were higher. On multivariate analysis, increasing RibScore and SCARF score were associated with an increased risk of respiratory failure, pneumonia, death, and SSRF. The sensitivity for a patient with a high risk score in either RibScore or SCARF increased to 96.3 % in identifying pulmonary complications (from 66.7 % in RibScore and 88 % in SCARF, when used individually) and 91.9 % in identifying association with SSRF (from 86.5 % in RibScore and 70.3 % in SCARF). RibScore and SCARF score demonstrate predictive ability for complications and SSRF in an Australian trauma rib fracture population.

The candidate eccDNAs were validated by routine polymerase chain reaction (PCR), TOPO-TA cloning and Sanger sequencing. In the validation cohort, 30 patients with PAH and 10 healthy controls were recruited for qPCR amplification to detect the candidate eccDNAs. Datas at the baseline were collected, including clinical background, biochemical variables, echocardiography and hemodynamic factors.

The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to detect the ability of variables to assess BMD. The z-test was used to compare the area under the curves of different variables. VBQ was more effective in identifying low BMD than osteoporosis (AUC, 0.768 vs. 0.613, p = 0.02). Elevated VBQ (OR 6.912, 95% CI 2.72-17.6) and low BMI (0.858, 0.76-0.97) were risk factors for low BMD, while the risk factor for osteoporosis was age (1.067, 1.02-1.12), not VBQ. ROC analysis showed that AUCs were 0.613 for VBQ and 0.665 for age when screening for osteoporosis. The combined variable of VBQ, sex, age, and BMI obtained by logistic regression significantly improved the efficacy of BMD screening, with an AUC of 0.824 for low BMD and 0.733 for osteoporosis. VBQ is better at detecting low BMD than identifying osteoporosis. The ability of VBQ to predict osteoporosis is limited, and a similar diagnostic efficacy can be achieved with age.

We screened candidate tsRNAs in 3 pairs of HCC and adjacent tissues through high-throughput sequencing. tRF-33-RZYQQ9M739P0J was screened in tissues, sera, and cells through quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) for further analysis. tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J was characterized using agarose gel electrophoresis, Sanger sequencing, and nuclear and cytoplasmic RNA isolation. Experiments at room temperature and repeated freeze-thaw cycles were conducted to evaluate the detection performance of tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J. We measured the levels of differential expression of tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J in sera using qRT-PCR. We applied the chi-square test to evaluate the correlation between tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J expression levels and clinicopathological features, and assessed its prognostic value by plotting Kaplan-Meier curves. The diagnostic efficacy of tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Finally, the downstream genes related to tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J were explored through bioinformatics prediction. tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J was highly expressed in HCC tissues and sera, and its expression was correlated with metastasis, TNM stage, BCLC stage, and vein invasion. Expression of tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J were decreased after surgery in patients with HCC. High serum tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J levels are associated with low survival rates, and they can predict survival times in patients with HCC according to the Kaplan-Meier analysis. Combining tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J with serum alpha-fetoprotein and prothrombin induced by vitamin K absence II can improve the diagnostic efficiency of HCC, suggesting its potential as a biomarker for HCC. tRF-33-RZYQHQ9M739P0J may not only be a promising non-invasive marker for early diagnosis, but also a predictor of liver cancer progression.","20240420","Heliyon","Medical School of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, 226001, China."

This study aimed to develop and validate a novel, machine-learning-derived model to predict cardiovascular mortality risk using office blood pressure (OBP) and ambulatory blood pressure (ABP). The performance of the novel risk score was compared with existing risk scores, and the possibility of predicting ABP phenotypes utilizing clinical variables was assessed. Using data from 59 124 patients enrolled in the Spanish ABP Monitoring registry, machine-learning approaches (logistic regression, gradient-boosted decision trees, and deep neural networks) and stepwise forward feature selection were used. For the prediction of cardiovascular mortality, deep neural networks yielded the highest clinical performance. The novel mortality prediction models using OBP and ABP outperformed other risk scores. The area under the curve achieved by the novel approach, already when using OBP variables, was significantly higher when compared with the area under the curve of the Framingham risk score, Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease score. However, the prediction of cardiovascular mortality with ABP instead of OBP data significantly increased the area under the curve (0.870 versus 0.865; P=3.61×10-28), accuracy, and specificity, respectively. The prediction of ABP phenotypes (ie, white-coat, ambulatory, and masked hypertension) using clinical characteristics was limited. The receiver operating characteristic curves for cardiovascular mortality using ABP and OBP with deep neural network models outperformed all other risk metrics, indicating the potential for improving current risk scores by applying state-of-the-art machine learning approaches. The prediction of cardiovascular mortality using ABP data led to a significant increase in area under the curve and performance metrics.","20240425","Hypertension (Dallas, Tex. : 1979)","Chair for Clinical Bioinformatics, Saarland University, Saarbrücken, Germany (P.G., A.K., T.F.)."

Clinical data were retrospectively analyzed for association with mortality and morbidity measured with the Comprehensive Complication Index (CCI). Predictability of WIC and other predictors were examined using area under receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). Among 110 patients included, 18 died (16.4%) and 36 (32.7%) had significant morbidity postoperatively (High CCI, ≥26.2). Both mortality and high CCI were associated with age >65 years, female sex, comorbidities (diabetes mellitus, hypertension, and renal disease), and American Society of Anesthesiologist score >2. Most patients who died had renal dysfunction, metabolic acidosis, lactate >2 mmol/L upon presentation preoperatively. While surgery >24 h after presentation correlated with mortality and high CCI, the benefit of earlier surgery <6 h or <12 h was not demonstrated. WIC (AUC, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.81-0.99) showed similar predictability to Peptic Ulcer Perforation (PULP) (AUC, 0.97; 95% CI, 0.93-1.00) for mortality. PULP effectively predicted high CCI (AUC, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.73-0.93; p < 0.001). WIC is valuable in predicting mortality, highlighting the importance of comorbidity in risk assessment.

No evidence from big data supports its possible additive value in outcome prediction. We performed a big data analysis to confirm the value of abdominal physical examinations in ICU patients without GI primary diseases. Patients were selected from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (MIMIC)-IV database and classified into two groups depending on whether they received abdominal palpation and auscultation. The primary outcome was the 28-day mortality. Statistical approaches included Cox regression, propensity score matching, and inverse probability of treatment weighting. Then, the abdominal physical examination group was randomly divided into the training and testing cohorts in an 8:2 ratio. And patients with GI primary diseases were selected as the validation group. Several machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, Adaboost, Extra Trees, Bagging, and Multi-Layer Perceptron, were used to develop in-hospital mortality predictive models. Abdominal physical examinations were performed in 868 (2.63%) of 33,007 patients without primary GI diseases. A significant benefit in terms of 28-day mortality was observed among the abdominal physical examination group (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.56-0.99; p = 0.043), and a higher examination frequency was associated with improved outcomes (HR 0.62, 95%CI 0.40-0.98; p = 0.042). Machine learning studies further revealed that abdominal physical examinations were valuable in predicting in-hospital mortality. Considering both model performance and storage space, the Multi-Layer Perceptron model performed the best in predicting mortality (AUC = 0.9548 in the testing set and AUC = 0.9833 in the validation set).

We aimed to develop a multi-outcome deep learning model using CT multi-level body composition parameters to detect metabolic syndrome (MS), osteoporosis and sarcopenia by identifying metabolic clusters simultaneously. We also investigated the prognostic value of metabolic phenotyping by CT model for long-term mortality. The derivation set (n = 516; 75% train set, 25% internal test set) was constructed using age- and sex-stratified random sampling from two community-based cohorts. Data from participants in the individual health assessment programme (n = 380) were used as the external test set 1. Semi-automatic quantification of body compositions at multiple levels of abdominal CT scans was performed to train a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based multi-label classification model. External test set 2 to test the prognostic value of the model output for mortality was built using data from individuals who underwent abdominal CT in a tertiary-level institution (n = 10 141). The mean ages of the derivation and external sets were 62.8 and 59.7 years, respectively, without difference in sex distribution (women 50%) or body mass index (BMI; 23.9 kg/m2). Skeletal muscle density (SMD) and bone density (BD) showed a more linear decrement across age than skeletal muscle area. Alternatively, an increase in visceral fat area (VFA) was observed in both men and women. Hierarchical clustering based on multi-level CT body composition parameters revealed three distinctive phenotype clusters: normal, MS and osteosarcopenia clusters. The L3 CT-parameter-based model, with or without clinical variables (age, sex and BMI), outperformed clinical model predictions of all outcomes (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: MS, 0.76 vs. 0.55; osteoporosis, 0.90 vs. 0.79; sarcopenia, 0.85 vs. 0.81 in external test set 1; P < 0.05 for all). VFA contributed the most to the MS predictions, whereas SMD, BD and subcutaneous fat area were features of high importance for detecting osteoporosis and sarcopenia.

This multidisciplinary prospective cohort study was conducted in a single academic ED over the course of a year. Adult patients with AKI were evaluated using the venous excess ultrasound (VExUS) score, which is a four-step ultrasound protocol. The protocol begins with the inferior vena cava (IVC) measurement and examines organ flow patterns, including portal, hepatic and renal veins in the presence of dilated IVC. The AKI subtypes (hypovolaemia, cardiorenal, systemic vasodilatation and renal) were adjudicated by nephrologists and emergency physicians, considering data that became available during the hospitalisation. We determined the diagnostic test characteristics of VExUS for identifying each of the four AKI aetiological subtypes. 150 patients with AKI were included in the study. Hypovolaemia was the most frequent finally adjudicated cause of AKI (66%), followed by cardiorenal (18%), systemic vasodilatation (8.7%) and renal (7.3%). In diagnosing the cardiorenal subtype, the area under the curve (AUC) for VExUS grade >0 was 0.819, with 77.8% sensitivity and 80.5% specificity, and the AUC for IVC maximum diameter >20.4 mm was 0.865, with 74.1% sensitivity and 86.2% specificity.

Using customized software, the raw gait data were preprocessed, emphasizing 12 essential gait variables. The data were standardized, and several machine learning models, including XGBoost, logistic regression, support vector machine, LightGBM, and Random Forest, were trained, tested, and evaluated. Special attention was given to class imbalance, addressed using the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE). Additionally, we introduced a novel methodology to compute the post-injury recovery rate for gait variables, which operates independently of the time difference between the gait analyses of different participants. XGBoost was identified as the optimal model both before and after the application of SMOTE. Before using SMOTE, the model achieved an average test area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.90, with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of [0.79, 1.00], and an average test accuracy of 86%, with a 95% CI of [75%, 97%]. Through feature importance analysis, a pivotal role was attributed to the duration between the occurrence of the injury and the initial gait analysis. Data patterns over time revealed early aggressive physiological compensations, followed by stabilization phases, underscoring the importance of prompt gait analysis. χ2 analysis indicated a statistically significant higher readmission rate among participants with underlying medical conditions (p = 0.04). Although the complication rate was also higher in this group, the association did not reach statistical significance (p = 0.06), suggesting a more pronounced impact of medical conditions on readmission rates rather than on complications.

Previous studies have shown that cage subsidence can be better predicted by measuring site-specific bone density. MRI-based Endplate Bone Quality (EBQ) scoring effectively predicts cage subsidence after lumbar interbody fusion. However, there is still a lack of studies on the practical application of EBQ scoring in the cervical spine. To create a similar MRI-based scoring system for Cervical-EBQ (C-EBQ) and to assess the correlation of the C-EBQ with endplate Computed Tomography (CT)-Hounsfield Units (HU) and the ability of this scoring system to independently predict cage subsidence after ACDF, comparing the predictive ability of the C-EBQ with the Cervical-Vertebral Bone Quality (C-VBQ) score. A total of 161 patients who underwent single-level ACDF for degenerative cervical spondylosis at our institution from 2012 to 2022 were included. Demographics, procedure-related data, and radiological data were collected, and Pearson correlation test was used to determine the correlation between C-EBQ and endplate HU values. Cage subsidence was defined as fusion segment height loss of ≥ 3 mm. Receiver operating characteristic analysis and area-under-the-curve values were used to assess the predictive ability of C-EBQ and C-VBQ. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed to identify potential risk factors associated with subsidence. Cage subsidence was present in 65 (40.4%) of 161 patients. The mean C-EBQ score was 1.81 ± 0.35 in the group without subsidence and 2.59 ± 0.58 in the group with subsidence (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis showed that a higher C-EBQ score was significantly associated with subsidence (OR = 5.700; 95%CI = 3.435-8.193; P < 0.001), was the only independent predictor of cage subsidence after ACDF, had a predictive accuracy of 93.7%, which was superior to the C-VBQ score (89.2%), and was significantly negatively correlated with the endplate HU value (r = -0.58, P < 0.001). Higher C-EBQ scores were significantly associated with postoperative cage subsidence after ACDF. There was a significant negative correlation between C-EBQ and endplate HU values.

In recent years, several studies have leveraged Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology to gauge an individual's mental state or level of depression. This study introduces a novel multi-tier ensemble learning approach to integrate multiple EEG bands for conducting mental state or depression assessments. Initially, the EEG signal is divided into eight sub-bands, and then a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) model is trained for each band. Subsequently, the integration of multi-band EEG frequency models and the evaluation of mental state or depression level are facilitated through a two-tier ensemble learning approach based on Multiple Linear Regression (MLR). The authors conducted numerous experiments to validate the performance of the proposed method under different evaluation metrics. For clarity and conciseness, the research employs the simplest commercialized one-channel EEG sensor, positioned at FP1, to collect data from 57 subjects (49 depressed and 18 healthy subjects). The obtained results, including an accuracy of 0.897, F1-score of 0.921, precision of 0.935, negative predictive value of 0.829, recall of 0.908, specificity of 0.875, and AUC of 0.8917, provide evidence of the superior performance of the proposed method compared to other ensemble learning techniques.

INSRF was deployed to critically analyze 166 patients with abdominal or pelvic NB who underwent surgery at our department between October 2021 and June 2023. Patient demographics, clinical characteristics, surgical data sets, and postoperative complications were described in detail. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to explore a new method to evaluate the extent of resection. A questionnaire was formulated to obtain attitudes/feedback and commentary from surgical oncologists with INSRF. One hundred sixty-six NB patients with a median disease age of 36.50 months. This study collated 320 INSRF reports. Among the 166 index cases, 137 were documented by 2 surgeons, with a concordance rate of 16.78%. Items with high inconsistency were (1) the extent of tumor resection (29.20%), (2) renal vein involvement (25.55%), (3) abdominal aorta encasement (16.79%), and (4) mesenteric infiltration (17.52%). According to INSRF, the extent of resection was complete excision in 86 (51.81%) patients, minimal residual tumor < 5 cm 3 in 67 (40.36%) patients, and incomplete excision > 5 cm 3 in 13 (7.83%) patients.

The questionnaires showed that surgeons agreed that the extent of resection and tumor involvement of organ/vascular structures were important, while the definition and intervention(s) of intraoperative complications were less operational and understandable. INSRF has significant clinical applications in NB surgery. The extent of resection can be predicted based on the number of tumor-encased blood vessels.

The current study proposed a wrist rotation imitation (WRI) task (a meaningless GMI assignment), and established a WRI ability evaluation system using low-cost wearable inertial sensors, which acquired the simultaneous data of acceleration and angular acceleration during the WRI task. Three metrics (i.e., total rotation time, rotation amplitude, and symmetry) were extracted from those data of acceleration and angular acceleration, and then were adopted to construct classifiers based on five machine learning (ML) algorithms, including k-nearest neighbors, linear discriminant analysis, naive Bayes, support vector machines, and random forests. To illustrate our technique, this study recruited 49 ASD children (aged 3.5-6.5 years) and 59 age-matched typically developing (TD) children. Findings showed that compared with TD children, those with ASD may exhibit shorter total rotation time, lower rotation amplitude, and weaker symmetry. This implies that children with ASD might exhibit decreased WRI abilities. The classifier with the naive Bayes algorithm outperformed than other four algorithms, and achieved a maximal classification accuracy of 88% and a maximal AUC value of 0.91. Two metrics (i.e., rotation amplitude and symmetry) had high correlations with the gross and fine motor skills [evaluated by Gesell Developmental Schedules-Third Edition and Psychoeducational Profile-3 (PEP-3)]. While, the three metrics had no significant correlation with the visual-motor imitation abilities (evaluated by the subdomain of PEP-3) and the ASD symptom severity [evaluated by the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS)] . The strengths of this study are associated with the low-cost measurement system, correlation between the WRI metrics and clinical measures, decreased WRI abilities in ASD, and high classification accuracy.","20240418","Frontiers in psychiatry","Key Laboratory of Child Development and Learning Science of Ministry of Education, School of Biological Science and Medical Engineering, Southeast University, Nanjing, China."

A cohort of 90 sarcoidosis patients and a cohort of 90 control subjects were enrolled. Clinical, anamnestic, and biochemical data were collected. Results showed that TyG index values were higher in the sarcoidosis cohort than in the control group (p < 0.001), even after excluding the influence of diabetes and metabolic syndrome (p = 0.018).

Pelvic morphology influences an individual's sagittal lumbar alignment. Our purpose is to investigate the sensitivity and specificity of lumbar sagittal radiographic alignment and modeling variables to identify if these can discriminate between normal controls and CLBP patients. Methods: We conducted a computer analysis of digitized vertebral body corners on lateral lumbar radiographs of normal controls and CLBP patients. Fifty normal controls were attained from a required pre-employment physical examination (29 men; 21 women; mean age of 27.7 ± 8.5 years), with no history of low back pain, a normal spinal examination, no pathologies, anomalies, or instability. Additionally, 50 CLBP patients (29 men; 29.5 ± 8 years of age) were randomly chosen and matched to the characteristics of the controls. The inclusion criteria required no abnormalities on lumbar spine radiographs. The parameters included the following: ARA L1-L5 lordosis, ARA T12-S1 lordosis, Cobb T12-S1, b/a elliptical modelling ratio, sacral base angle (SBA), and S1 posterior tangent to vertical (PTS1). Two measures of pelvic morphology were determined for each person-the angle of pelvic incidence (API) and posterior tangent pelvic incidence angle (PTPIA)-and the relationships between API - ARA T12-S1, API - Cobb T12-S1, and API - ARA L1-5 was determined. Descriptive statistics and correlations among the primary variables were determined. The receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC curves) for primary variables were analyzed. Results: The mean values of LL were statistically different between the normal and CLBP groups (p < 0.001), indicating a hypo-lordotic lumbar spine for the CLBP group. The mean b/a ratio was lower in the chronic pain group (p = 0.0066). The pelvic morphology variables were similar between the groups (p > 0.05). API had a stronger correlation to the SBA and Cobb T12-S1 than PTPIA did, while PTPIA had a stronger correlation to the S1 tangent and ARA T12-S1 than API did. While CLBP patients had a stronger correlation of ARA T12-S1 and Cobb T12-S1 relative to the pelvic morphology, they also had a reduced correlation of ARA L1-L5 lordosis relative to their SBA and pelvic morphology measures. API - T12-S1, API - L1-L5, and API - Cobb T12-S1 were statistically different between the groups, p < 0.001. Using ROC curve analyses, it was identified that ARA L1-L5 lordosis of 36° and ARA T12-S1 of 68° have a good sensitivity and specificity to discriminate between normal and CLBP patients. ROC curve analyses identified that lordosis ARAT12-S1 < 68° (AUC = 0.83), lordosis ARAL1-L5 < 36° (AUC = 0.78), API - ARA T12-S1 < -18° (AUC = 0.75), API - ARAL1-L5 > 35° (AUC = 0.71), and API - Cobb T12-S1 < -5° (AUC = 0.69) had moderate to good discrimination between groups (AUC = 0.83, 0.78, 0.75, and 0.72).

There has been a significant improvement in the treatment of younger patients, however, prognosis in the elderly AML patients remains poor. Methods: We used computational methods and machine learning (ML) techniques to identify and explore the differential high-risk genes (DHRGs) in AML. The DHRGs were explored through multiple in silico approaches including genomic and functional analysis, survival analysis, immune infiltration, miRNA co-expression and stemness features analyses to reveal their prognostic importance in AML. Furthermore, using different ML algorithms, prognostic models were constructed and validated using the DHRGs. At the end molecular docking studies were performed to identify potential drug candidates targeting the selected DHRGs. Results: We identified a total of 80 DHRGs by comparing the differentially expressed genes derived between AML patients and normal controls and high-risk AML genes identified by Cox regression. Genetic and epigenetic alteration analyses of the DHRGs revealed a significant association of their copy number variations and methylation status with overall survival (OS) of AML patients. Out of the 137 models constructed using different ML algorithms, the combination of Ridge and plsRcox maintained the highest mean C-index and was used to build the final model. When AML patients were classified into low- and high-risk groups based on DHRGs, the low-risk group had significantly longer OS in the AML training and validation cohorts. Furthermore, immune infiltration, miRNA coexpression, stemness feature and hallmark pathway analyses revealed significant differences in the prognosis of the low- and high-risk AML groups. Drug sensitivity and molecular docking studies revealed top 5 drugs, including carboplatin and austocystin-D that may significantly affect the DHRGs in AML. Conclusion: The findings from the current study identified a set of high-risk genes that may be used as prognostic and therapeutic markers for AML patients. In addition, significant use of the ML algorithms in constructing and validating the prognostic models in AML was demonstrated. Although our study used extensive bioinformatics and machine learning methods to identify the hub genes in AML, their experimental validations using knock-out/-in methods would strengthen our findings.","20240408","Frontiers in pharmacology","Department of Hematology, Affiliated Hospital of Nantong University, Medical School of Nantong University, Nantong, Jiangsu, China."

Discriminative AUCs were achieved even in families with a low FF. We further investigate the performance of our method in correctly predicting SNVs in coding regions of clinically relevant genes and demonstrate significantly improved AUCs in these regions. Finally, we focus on the pathogenic variants in our cohort and show that our method correctly predicts if the fetus is unaffected or affected in all (10/10, 100%) of the families containing a pathogenic SNV.

Early detection and treatment are critical in preventing the progression of the illness and its associated life-threatening complications. In recent years, machine learning algorithms have emerged as powerful tools for disease prediction and diagnosis. In this study, we developed machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of Chagas disease based on five general factors: age, gender, history of living in a mud or wooden house, history of being bitten by a triatomine bug, and family history of Chagas disease. We analyzed data from the Retrovirus Epidemiology Donor Study (REDS) to train five popular machine learning algorithms. The sample comprised 2,006 patients, divided into 75% for training and 25% for testing algorithm performance. We evaluated the model performance using precision, recall, and AUC-ROC metrics. The Adaboost algorithm yielded an AUC-ROC of 0.772, a precision of 0.199, and a recall of 0.612. We simulated the decision boundary using various thresholds and observed that in this dataset a threshold of 0.45 resulted in a 100% recall. This finding suggests that employing such a threshold could potentially save 22.5% of the cost associated with mass testing of Chagas disease. Our findings highlight the potential of applying machine learning to improve the sensitivity and effectiveness of Chagas disease diagnosis and prevention. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of integrating socio-demographic and environmental factors into neglected disease prediction models to enhance their performance.","20240416","PLoS neglected tropical diseases","Faculdade de Medicina da Universidade de São Paulo-FMUSP, São Paulo, Brazil."

Differentially expressed proteins were identified via Data Independent Acquisition (DIA) proteomic profiling in a screening cohort composed of eight healthy mares and eight mares with endometritis. Subsequently, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay was employed that included a validation cohort of 40 healthy mares and 40 mares with endometritis to verify the accuracy and sensitivity of the identified proteins, thereby establishing a diagnostic threshold. In the screening cohort, 12 proteins were significantly differentially expressed between endometritis mares and healthy controls (p < 0.05, outside the 1/1.2 to 1.2-fold).

Epidural blood patch is the main treatment option for SIH; however, the characteristics of patients who experience relapse after successful EBP treatment for SIH remain understudied. In this exploratory, retrospective, case-control study, we included 19 patients with SIH recurrence after EBP and 36 age- and sex-matched patients without recurrence from a single tertiary medical institution. We analyzed clinical characteristics, neuroimaging findings, and volume changes in intracranial structures after EBP treatment. Machine learning methods were utilized to predict the recurrence of SIH after EBP treatment. There were no significant differences in clinical features between the recurrence and no-recurrence groups. Among brain magnetic resonance imaging signs, diffuse pachymeningeal enhancement and cerebral venous dilatation were more prominent in the recurrence group than no-recurrence group after EBP (14/19 [73%] vs. eight of 36 [22%] patients, p = 0.001; 11/19 [57%] vs. seven of 36 [19%] patients, p = 0.010, respectively).

For this reason, multiple automatic approaches have been raised in the last years to support clinical practice and diagnosis. Unfortunately, most state-of-the-art proposals apply attention mechanisms without considering the spatial instance correlation and usually work on a single-scale resolution. To leverage the full potential of pyramidal structured WSI, we propose a graph-based multi-scale MIL approach, DAS-MIL. Our model comprises three modules: i) a self-supervised feature extractor, ii) a graph-based architecture that precedes the MIL mechanism and aims at creating a more contextualized representation of the WSI structure by considering the mutual (spatial) instance correlation both inter and intra-scale. Finally, iii) a (self) distillation loss between resolutions is introduced to compensate for their informative gap and significantly improve the final prediction.

Such predictions can give important input to medical decision-making. However, evaluating the predictive performance of interventional predictions is challenging. Standard ways of evaluating predictive performance do not apply when using observational data, because prediction under interventions involves obtaining predictions of the outcome under conditions that are different from those that are observed for a subset of individuals in the validation dataset. This work describes methods for evaluating counterfactual performance of predictions under interventions for time-to-event outcomes. This means we aim to assess how well predictions would match the validation data if all individuals had followed the treatment strategy under which predictions are made. We focus on counterfactual performance evaluation using longitudinal observational data, and under treatment strategies that involve sustaining a particular treatment regime over time. We introduce an estimation approach using artificial censoring and inverse probability weighting that involves creating a validation dataset mimicking the treatment strategy under which predictions are made. We extend measures of calibration, discrimination (c-index and cumulative/dynamic AUCt) and overall prediction error (Brier score) to allow assessment of counterfactual performance.

Insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) signaling is implicated in tumor development and progression and induces apoptosis of cancer cells following functional inhibition. However, the relationship between the IGF-1R-related signaling pathway genes and glioma prognosis or immunotherapy/chemotherapy is poorly understood. LASSO-Cox regression was employed to develop a 16-gene risk signature in the TCGA-GBMLGG cohort, and all patients with glioma were divided into low-risk and high-risk subgroups. The relationships between the risk signature and the tumor immune microenvironment (TIME), immunotherapy response, and chemotherapy response were then analyzed. Immunohistochemistry was used to evaluate the HSP90B1 level in clinical glioma tissue. The gene risk signature yielded superior predictive efficacy in prognosis (5-year area under the curve: 0.875) and can therefore serve as an independent prognostic indicator in patients with glioma. The high-risk subgroup exhibited abundant immune infltration and elevated immune checkpoint gene expression within the TIME. Subsequent analysis revealed that patients in the high-risk subgroup benefited more from chemotherapy. Immunohistochemical analysis confirmed that HSP90B1 was overexpressed in glioma, with significantly higher levels observed in glioblastoma than in astrocytoma or oligodendrocytoma. The newly identified 16-gene risk signature demonstrates a robust predictive capacity for glioma prognosis and plays a pivotal role in the TIME, thereby offering valuable insights for the exploration of novel biomarkers and targeted therapeutics.","20240411","Frontiers in cell and developmental biology","Department of Neurosurgery, Affiliated Hospital of Jiangsu University, Zhenjiang, Jiangsu, China."

Seventy-seven predictor candidates from prehospitalization to 1 year of follow-up were included, and six machine learning approaches were analyzed. Primary outcome was defined as 1-year all-cause death. Secondary outcomes included all-cause deaths, cardiovascular deaths, and major adverse cardiovascular event (MACE) at the 1-year and 3-year follow-ups. Random forest resulted best performance in predicting the primary outcome, exhibiting a 99.6% accuracy along with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve of 0.874. Top 10 predictors for the primary outcome included peak troponin-I (variable importance value = 0.048), in-hospital duration (0.047), total cholesterol (0.047), maintenance of antiplatelet at 1 year (0.045), coronary lesion classification (0.043), N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide levels (0.039), body mass index (BMI) (0.037), door-to-balloon time (0.035), vascular approach (0.033), and use of glycoprotein IIb/IIIa inhibitor (0.032). Notably, BMI was identified as one of the most important predictors of major outcomes after AMI. BMI revealed distinct effects on each outcome, highlighting a U-shaped influence on 1-year and 3-year MACE and 3-year all-cause death.

We retrospectively included 89,855 Korean women who underwent their initial screening digital mammography from 2009 to 2020. Breast cancer within 12 months of the screening mammography was the reference standard, according to the National Cancer Registry. Lunit software was used to determine the probability of malignancy scores, with a cutoff of 10% for breast cancer detection. The AI's performance was compared with that of the final Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System category, as recorded by breast radiologists. Breast density was classified into four categories (A-D) based on the radiologist and AI-based assessments. The performance metrics (cancer detection rate [CDR], sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value [PPV], recall rate, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]) were compared across breast density categories. Mean participant age was 43.5 ± 8.7 years; 143 breast cancer cases were identified within 12 months.

In this research, a comprehensive approach was adopted to recognize factors influencing forest fires. Golestan National Park (GNP) was considered as a representative area with a humid climate in this study. Initially, using the Multi-Criteria Evaluation Method, a fire risk map was created by analyzing natural and human factors, and vulnerable areas were identified. Then, the relationship between key elements such as meteorological conditions, Land Surface Temperature (LST), and precipitation, with the occurrence of fire in different years was investigated. CHIRPS and Landsat data were utilized to assess LST changes and precipitation. 23-year changes in fire occurrence areas in GNP were acquired using MODIS products. The results of the data analysis showed that the highest number of fires occurred in forest areas, and in the fire risk prediction map, the extremely high-risk class is completely consistent with the ground truth data. The assigned weights, derived from expert opinions, highlight the substantial significance of elevation, and distance from roads and settlements. Additionally, the effectiveness of the model in providing reliable forecasts for fire risks in GNP is highlighted by the ROC curve with an AUC value of 0.83. Forest fires within GNP exhibit a distinct seasonality, predominantly occurring from July to December. During the warmer months, by coinciding with summer excursions, human activities may contribute to the ignition of fires. In 2013 and 2014, rising fire incidents correlated with elevated temperatures, hinting at a potential connection. GNP fires showed an upward trend with higher monthly LST and a downward trend with increased annual precipitation. The results showed that there is a relationship between LST, precipitation, and the occurrence of fire in GNP. Approximately 176.15 ha of GNP's forest areas have been destroyed by fires over the last two decades. This research demonstrated that there is a dynamic interaction between environmental conditions and fire incidents. By considering these factors, managers and environmental planners can develop effective strategies for managing and preventing forest fire risks.","20240419","Journal of environmental management","Department of Environmental Sciences, Faculty of Fisheries and Environmental Sciences, Gorgan University of Agricultural Sciences and Natural Resources, Gorgan, Golestan, Iran."

Therefore, we used machine learning (ML) algorithm to develop models to predict frailty risk in the elderly. A prospective cohort study. We collected data on 6997 elderly people from Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Study wave 6-7 surveys (2011-2012, 2014). After the baseline survey in 1998 (wave 1), the project conducted follow-up surveys (wave 2-8) in 2000-2018. The osteoporotic fractures index was used to assess frailty. Four ML algorithms (random forest [RF], support vector machine, XGBoost and logistic regression [LR]) were used to develop models to identify the risk factors of frailty and predict the risk of frailty. Different ML models were used for the prediction of frailty risk in the elderly and frailty risk was trained on a cohort of 4385 elderly people with frailty (split into a training cohort [75%] and internal validation cohort [25%]). The best-performing model for each study outcome was tested in an external validation cohort of 6997 elderly people with frailty pooled from the surveys (wave 6-7). Model performance was assessed by receiver operating curve and F2-score. Among the four ML models, the F2-score values were similar (0.91 vs. 0.91 vs. 0.88 vs. 0.90), and the area under the curve (AUC) values of RF model was the highest (0.75), followed by LR model (0.74). In the final two models, the AUC values of RF and LR model were similar (0.77 vs. 0.76) and their accuracy was identical (87.4% vs. 87.4%). Our study developed a preliminary prediction model based on two different ML approaches to help predict frailty risk in the elderly. The presented models from this study can be used to inform healthcare providers to predict the frailty probability among older adults and maybe help guide the development of effective frailty risk management interventions. Detecting frailty at an early stage and implementing timely targeted interventions may help to improve the allocation of health care resources and to reduce frailty-related burden. Identifying risk factors for frailty could be beneficial to provide tailored and personalized care intervention for older adults to more accurately prevent or improve their frail conditions so as to improve their quality of life.

Studies have demonstrated that medical images could be utilized for non-invasive prediction of biomarker statues. The biomarker status-associated features extracted from medical images are essential in developing medical image-based non-invasive prediction models. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) is a promising imaging technique for breast cancer diagnosis. This study aims to develop a neural network-based method to extract biomarker-related image features from CEM images and evaluate the potential of CEM in non-invasive biomarker status prediction. An end-to-end learning convolutional neural network with the whole breast images as inputs was proposed to extract CEM features for biomarker status prediction in breast cancer. The network focused on lesion regions and flexibly extracted image features from lesion and peri‑tumor regions by employing supervised learning with a smooth L1-based consistency constraint. An image-level weakly supervised segmentation network based on Vision Transformer with cross attention to contrast images of breasts with lesions against the contralateral breast images was developed for automatic lesion segmentation. Finally, prediction models were developed following further selection of significant features and the implementation of random forest-based classification. Results were reported using the area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. A dataset from 1203 breast cancer patients was utilized to develop and evaluate the proposed method. Compared to the method without lesion attention and with only lesion regions as inputs, the proposed method performed better at biomarker status prediction. Specifically, it achieved an AUC of 0.71 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.65, 0.77) for Ki-67 and 0.73 (95 % CI: 0.65, 0.80) for human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2).

Aiming at protein-DNA interaction hotspots, this work introduces an effective prediction method, ESPDHot based on a stacked ensemble machine learning framework. Here, the interface residue whose mutation leads to a binding free energy change (ΔΔG) exceeding 2 kcal/mol is defined as a hotspot. To tackle the imbalanced data set issue, the adaptive synthetic sampling (ADASYN), an oversampling technique, is adopted to synthetically generate new minority samples, thereby rectifying data imbalance. As for molecular characteristics, besides traditional features, we introduce three new characteristic types including residue interface preference proposed by us, residue fluctuation dynamics characteristics, and coevolutionary features. Combining the Boruta method with our previously developed Random Grouping strategy, we obtained an optimal set of features. Finally, a stacking classifier is constructed to output prediction results, which integrates three classical predictors, Support Vector Machine (SVM), XGBoost, and Artificial Neural Network (ANN) as the first layer, and Logistic Regression (LR) algorithm as the second one. Notably, ESPDHot outperforms the current state-of-the-art predictors, achieving superior performance on the independent test data set, with F1, MCC, and AUC reaching 0.571, 0.516, and 0.870, respectively.","20240408","Journal of chemical information and modeling","College of Chemistry and Life Science, Beijing University of Technology, Beijing 100124, China."

Because older individuals are more likely to have multiple comorbidities or increased frailty, the impact of anxiety disorders on their overall well-being is exacerbated. Early identification of anxiety disorders using machine learning (ML) can potentially mitigate the adverse consequences associated with these disorders. We applied ML to the data from the Canadian Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) to predict the onset of anxiety disorders approximately three years in the future. We used Shapley value-based methods to determine the top factor for prediction. We also investigated whether anxiety onset can be predicted by baseline depression-related predictors alone. Our model was able to predict anxiety onset accurately (Area under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve or AUC = 0.814 ± 0.016 (mean ± standard deviation), balanced accuracy = 0.741 ± 0.016, sensitivity = 0.743 ± 0.033, and specificity = 0.738 ± 0.010). The top predictive factors included prior depression or mood disorder diagnosis, high frailty, anxious personality, and low emotional stability. Depression and mood disorders are well known comorbidity of anxiety; however a prior depression or mood disorder diagnosis could not predict anxiety onset without other factors. While our findings underscore the importance of a prior depression diagnosis in predicting anxiety, they also highlight that it alone is inadequate, signifying the necessity to incorporate additional predictors for improved prediction accuracy. Our study showcases promising prospects for using machine learning to develop personalized prediction models for anxiety onset in middle-aged and older adults using easy-to-access survey data.","20240424","Journal of affective disorders","Department of Psychiatry, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta, Canada."

In symptomatic cases, surgery with posterior fossa decompression (PFD) is the treatment of choice. Surgery is, however, associated with peri- and postoperative complications that may require readmission or renewed surgical intervention. Given the associated financial costs and the impact on patients' well-being, there is a need for predictive tools that can assess the likelihood of such adverse events. The aim of this study was therefore to leverage machine learning algorithms to develop a predictive model for 30-day readmissions and reoperations after PFD in pediatric patients with CM-I. This was a retrospective study based on data from the National Surgical Quality Improvement Program-Pediatric database. Eligible patients were those undergoing PFD (Current Procedural Terminology code 61343) for CM-I between 2012 and 2021. Patients undergoing surgery for tumors or vascular lesions were excluded. Unplanned 30-day readmission and unplanned 30-day reoperation were the main study outcomes. Additional outcome data considered included the length of hospital stay, 30-day complications, discharge disposition, and 30-day mortality. Training and testing samples were randomly generated (80:20) to study the 30-day readmission and reoperation using logistic regression, decision tree, random forest (RF), K-nearest neighbors, and Gaussian naive Bayes algorithms. A total of 7106 pediatric patients undergoing PFD were included. The median age was 9.2 years (IQR 4.7, 14.2 years). Most of the patients were female (56%). The 30-day readmission and reoperation rates were 7.5% and 3.4%, respectively. Headaches (32%) and wound-related complications (30%) were the most common reasons for 30-day readmission, while wound revisions and evacuation of fluid or blood (62%), followed by CSF diversion-related procedures (28%), were the most common reasons for 30-day reoperation. RF classifiers had the highest predictive accuracy for both 30-day readmissions (area under the curve [AUC] 0.960) and reoperations (AUC 0.990) compared with the other models. On feature importance analysis, sex, developmental delay, ethnicity, respiratory disease, premature birth, hydrocephalus, and congenital/genetic anomaly were some of the variables contributing the most to both RF models. Using a large-scale nationwide dataset, machine learning models for the prediction of both 30-day readmissions and reoperations were developed and achieved high accuracy.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for new therapeutic targets and improved tumor tracking methods. This study aims to address these challenges by proposing a strategy for identifying membrane proteins in tumors that can be targeted for specific BC therapy and diagnosis. The strategy involves the analyses of gene expressions in breast tumor and non-tumor tissues and other healthy tissues by using comprehensive bioinformatics analysis from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), UALCAN, TNM Plot, and LinkedOmics. By employing this strategy, we identified four transcripts (LRRC15, EFNA3, TSPAN13, and CA12) that encoded membrane proteins with an increased expression in BC tissue compared to healthy tissue. These four transcripts also demonstrated high accuracy, specificity, and accuracy in identifying tumor samples, as confirmed by the ROC curve. Additionally, tissue microarray (TMA) analysis revealed increased expressions of the four proteins in tumor tissues across all molecular subtypes compared to the adjacent breast tissue. Moreover, the analysis of human interactome data demonstrated the important roles of these proteins in various cancer-related pathways. Taken together, these findings suggest that LRRC15, EFNA3, TSPAN13, and CA12 can serve as potential biomarkers for improving cancer diagnosis screening and as suitable targets for therapy with reduced side effects and enhanced efficacy.","20240403","Cancers","Translational Oncology Platform, Center for Technological Development in Health, Fundação Oswaldo Cruz (Fiocruz), Rio de Janeiro 21040-900, RJ, Brazil."

Fairness metrics have been proposed to measure algorithmic bias, but their application to real-world tasks is limited. This study aims to evaluate the algorithmic bias associated with the application of common 30-day hospital readmission models and assess the usefulness and interpretability of selected fairness metrics. We used 10.6 million adult inpatient discharges from Maryland and Florida from 2016 to 2019 in this retrospective study. Models predicting 30-day hospital readmissions were evaluated: LACE Index, modified HOSPITAL score, and modified Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) readmission measure, which were applied as-is (using existing coefficients) and retrained (recalibrated with 50% of the data). Predictive performances and bias measures were evaluated for all, between Black and White populations, and between low- and other-income groups. Bias measures included the parity of false negative rate (FNR), false positive rate (FPR), 0-1 loss, and generalized entropy index. Racial bias represented by FNR and FPR differences was stratified to explore shifts in algorithmic bias in different populations. The retrained CMS model demonstrated the best predictive performance (area under the curve: 0.74 in Maryland and 0.68-0.70 in Florida), and the modified HOSPITAL score demonstrated the best calibration (Brier score: 0.16-0.19 in Maryland and 0.19-0.21 in Florida). Calibration was better in White (compared to Black) populations and other-income (compared to low-income) groups, and the area under the curve was higher or similar in the Black (compared to White) populations. The retrained CMS and modified HOSPITAL score had the lowest racial and income bias in Maryland. In Florida, both of these models overall had the lowest income bias and the modified HOSPITAL score showed the lowest racial bias. In both states, the White and higher-income populations showed a higher FNR, while the Black and low-income populations resulted in a higher FPR and a higher 0-1 loss. When stratified by hospital and population composition, these models demonstrated heterogeneous algorithmic bias in different contexts and populations. Caution must be taken when interpreting fairness measures' face value. A higher FNR or FPR could potentially reflect missed opportunities or wasted resources, but these measures could also reflect health care use patterns and gaps in care. Simply relying on the statistical notions of bias could obscure or underplay the causes of health disparity. The imperfect health data, analytic frameworks, and the underlying health systems must be carefully considered. Fairness measures can serve as a useful routine assessment to detect disparate model performances but are insufficient to inform mechanisms or policy changes. However, such an assessment is an important first step toward data-driven improvement to address existing health disparities.","20240418","Journal of medical Internet research","Bloomberg School of Public Health, Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States."

This study aimed to establish the association between pelvic enthesis involvement on pelvic X-ray and SpA diagnosis through a radiographic enthesis index (REI) and to assess the reliability and accuracy of this REI. The participants were SpA patients and a control group composed of patients with chronic lumbar pain without SpA. Three blinded observers assessed each pelvic radiography three times. Three zones were used: Zone I (ZI), the iliopubic ramus; Zone II (ZII), the pubic symphysis, and Zone III (ZIII), the ischiopubic ramus. A grading system was created from 0 to 3 [Grade 0, normal; Grade 1, minimal changes (subcortical bone demineralization and/or periosteal wishkering, seen as radiolucency and trabeculation of the cortical bone upon tendon insertion); Grade 2, destructive changes (Grade 1 findings and erosions at the enthesis site); and Grade 3, findings of Grade 2 plus >2 mm whiskering out of the cortical bone) for the REI. The sum of the results of the three zones was called the total REI. For statistical analysis, we used the weighted kappa statistic adjusted for prevalence and bias using Gwet's agreement coefficient. We enrolled 161 patients, 111 of them with SpA (39.6 % with axial SpA and 47.7 % with peripheral SpA) and 50 without SpA. In the SpA group, 36.7 % and 25.7 % had REI Grades 2 and 3 in ZIII, respectively, while only 6 % of the controls had these grades. For ZI, the frequency of Grades 1 to 3 was 42.3 % in the SpA group (8.1 %, 14.4 %, and 19.8 %, respectively), compared to only 2 % in the controls. ZII was unaffected in most of the patients with SpA (82.9 %) and in the controls (98 %). In the control group, Grade 0 was the most common REI grade in all three zones. The agreement was almost perfect for each zone and between the independent readers. The ROC-curve analysis showed that the highest performance areas were the total REI, ZIII, and ZI. Most (75 %) of the SpA patients without sacroiliitis on X-ray were REI-positive. The sensitivity of the REI for SpA diagnosis was 82 %, while the sensitivity of sacroiliitis on X-ray was 38.7 %. The assessment of pelvic enthesis using the REI on pelvic radiography may be useful for SpA diagnosis. Total REI, ZIII, and ZI had the highest accuracy and almost perfect reliability.

However, existing methods often produce mis-segmentation when dealing with low contrast images and thin blood vessels, which affects the continuity and integrity of the vessel skeleton. In addition, existing deep learning methods tend to lose a lot of detailed information during training, which affects the accuracy of segmentation. To address these issues, we propose a novel dual-decoder based Cross-patch Feature Interactive Net with Edge Refinement (CFI-Net) for end-to-end retinal vessel segmentation. In the encoder part, a joint refinement down-sampling method (JRDM) is proposed to compress feature information in the process of reducing image size, so as to reduce the loss of thin vessels and vessel edge information during the encoding process. In the decoder part, we adopt a dual-path model based on edge detection, and propose a Cross-patch Interactive Attention Mechanism (CIAM) in the main path to enhancing multi-scale spatial channel features and transferring cross-spatial information. Consequently, it improve the network's ability to segment complete and continuous vessel skeletons, reducing vessel segmentation fractures. Finally, the Adaptive Spatial Context Guide Method (ASCGM) is proposed to fuse the prediction results of the two decoder paths, which enhances segmentation details while removing part of the background noise. We evaluated our model on two retinal image datasets and one coronary angiography dataset, achieving outstanding performance in segmentation comprehensive assessment metrics such as AUC and CAL. The experimental results showed that the proposed CFI-Net has superior segmentation performance compared with other existing methods, especially for thin vessels and vessel edges.

An efficient detectability assessment method that is sensitive to small effects of dose and scanner settings is desirable. We previously proposed a method using a search challenge instrument: a phantom is embedded with hundreds of lesions at random locations, and a model observer is used to detect lesions. Preliminary tests in simulation and a prototype showed promising results. In this work, we fabricated a full-size search challenge phantom with design updates, including changes to lesion size, contrast, and number, and studied our implementation by comparing the lesion detectability from a nonprewhitening (NPW) model observer between different reconstructions at different exposure levels, and by estimating the instrument sensitivity to detect changes in dose. Designed to fit into QRM anthropomorphic phantoms, our search challenge phantom is a cylindrical insert 10 cm wide and 4 cm thick, embedded with 12 000 lesions (nominal width of 0.6 mm, height of 0.8 mm, and contrast of -350 HU), and was fabricated using PixelPrint, a 3D printing technique. The insert was scanned alone at a high dose to assess printing accuracy. To evaluate lesion detectability, the insert was placed in a QRM thorax phantom and scanned from 50 to 625 mAs with increments of 25 mAs, once per exposure level, and the average of all exposure levels was used as high-dose reference. Scans were reconstructed with three different settings: filtered-backprojection (FBP) with Br40 and Br59, and Sinogram Affirmed Iterative Reconstruction (SAFIRE) with strength level 5 and Br59 kernel. An NPW model observer was used to search for lesions, and detection performance of different settings were compared using area under the exponential transform of free response ROC curve (AUC). Using propagation of uncertainty, the sensitivity to changes in dose was estimated by the percent change in exposure due to one standard deviation of AUC, measured from 5 repeat scans at 100, 200, 300, and 400 mAs. The printed insert lesions had an average position error of 0.20 mm compared to printing reference. As the exposure level increases from 50 mAs to 625 mAs, the lesion detectability AUCs increase from 0.38 to 0.92, 0.42 to 0.98, and 0.41 to 0.97 for FBP Br40, FBP Br59, and SAFIRE Br59, respectively, with a lower rate of increase at higher exposure level. FBP Br59 performed best with AUC 0.01 higher than SAFIRE Br59 on average and 0.07 higher than FBP Br40 (all P < 0.001). The standard deviation of AUC was less than 0.006, and the sensitivity to detect changes in mAs was within 2% for FBP Br59. Our 3D-printed search challenge phantom with 12 000 submillimeter lesions, together with an NPW model observer, provide an efficient CT detectability assessment method that is sensitive to subtle effects in reconstruction and is sensitive to small changes in dose.","20240408","Medical physics","Faculty of Medicine, Chulalongkorn University, Bangkok, Thailand."

A total of 78 participants were randomly allocated to the remimazolam (R) or sevoflurane (S) groups. The primary outcome was the incidence of hypotension that occurred immediately after switching to a BCP. The secondary outcomes included differences between the study groups in perioperative blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR), endotracheal tube extubation time, postoperative complications, and hospital length of stay (LOS). Results: The incidence of hypotension immediately after switching to a BCP was significantly higher in the S group. The risk factors associated with hypotension included sevoflurane administration and a high baseline systolic BP. In the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for the occurrence of hypotension after the transition to a BCP, the cutoff value for systolic BP was 142 mmHg. The perioperative BP and HR were higher in the R group at several timepoints. Postoperative endotracheal tube extubation time was shorter in the R group. There were no significant differences in the postoperative complications or hospital LOS between the two groups. Conclusions: Remimazolam should be considered as an anesthetic agent to prevent hypotension when switching to BCP, and hypotension may occur frequently in patients with high baseline BP.","20240418","Journal of clinical medicine","Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Kyung Hee University College of Medicine, Kyung Hee University Hospital, Seoul 02447, Republic of Korea."

We benchmark our results against a ResNet-50 CNN trained on spectrogram images. Our final dataset consisted of 366 normal heart sounds, 175 innocent murmurs, and 216 pathologic murmurs. Innocent murmurs collected include Still's murmur, venous hum, and flow murmurs. Pathologic murmurs included ventricular septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, aortic regurgitation, aortic stenosis, pulmonary stenosis, mitral regurgitation and stenosis, and tricuspid regurgitation. We find that the Vision Transformer consistently outperforms the ResNet-50 on all three image representations, and that the Gramian angular field is the superior image representation for pediatric heart sounds. We calculated a one-vs-rest multi-class ROC curve for each of the three classes. Our best model achieves an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.92 ± 0.05, 0.83 ± 0.04, and 0.88 ± 0.04 for identifying normal heart sounds, innocent murmurs, and pathologic murmurs, respectively. We present two novel methods for pediatric heart sound classification, which outperforms the current standard of using a convolutional neural network trained on spectrogram images. To our knowledge, we are the first to demonstrate multi-class classification of pediatric murmurs. Multiclass output affords a more explainable and interpretable model, which can facilitate further model improvement in the downstream model development cycle and enhance clinician trust and therefore adoption.","20240404","Artificial intelligence in medicine","Weill Cornell Medicine, New York, NY 10021, USA.

Therefore, these preferences should be taken into account when designing formulations and prescriptions. This study investigates the factors affecting patient preference in patients who have difficulties swallowing large tablets or capsules and aims to identify appropriate sizes for tablets and capsules. A robust data set was developed based on a questionnaire survey conducted from December 1, 2022, to December 7, 2022, using the harmo smartphone app operated by harmo Co, Ltd. The data set included patient input regarding their tablet and capsule preferences, personal health records (including dispensing history), and drug formulation information (available from package inserts). Based on the medication formulation information, 6 indices were set for each of the tablets or capsules that were considered difficult to swallow owing to their large size and concomitant tablets or capsules (used as controls). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the performance of each index. The index demonstrating the highest area under the curve of the ROC was selected as the best index to determine the tablet or capsule size that leads to swallowing difficulties. From the generated ROCs, the point with the highest discriminative performance that maximized the Youden index was identified, and the optimal threshold for each index was calculated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors contributing to difficulty in swallowing oversized tablets or capsules. Additionally, decision tree analysis was performed to estimate the combined risk from several factors, using risk factors that were significant in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. This study analyzed 147 large tablets or capsules and 624 control tablets or capsules. The ""long diameter + short diameter + thickness"" index (with a 21.5 mm threshold) was identified as the best indicator for causing swallowing difficulties in patients. The multivariate logistic regression analysis (including 132 patients with swallowing difficulties and 1283 patients without) results identified the following contributory risk factors: aged <50 years (odds ratio [OR] 1.59, 95% CI 1.03-2.44), female (OR 2.54, 95% CI 1.70-3.78), dysphagia (OR 3.54, 95% CI 2.22-5.65), and taking large tablets or capsules (OR 9.74, 95% CI 5.19-18.29). The decision tree analysis results suggested an elevated risk of swallowing difficulties for patients with taking large tablets or capsules. This study identified the most appropriate index and threshold for indicating that a given tablet or capsule size will cause swallowing difficulties, as well as the contributory risk factors.

A total of 1819 participants above 60 without sarcopenia at baseline were included from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS). Cox models were applied to evaluate the association between TyG and incident sarcopenia. Mediation analyses were performed to evaluate the contribution of the level of BMI to observed associations. During a median follow-up of 4.0 years, 217 (11.9 %) participants developed sarcopenia. The multivariable-adjusted hazard ratios of total sarcopenia in higher quartiles of TyG index versus the lowest quartiles were 0.59, 0.61, and 0.46, respectively. There were significant trends toward a decreasing risk of sarcopenia across the quartiles of TyG index before adjusting for BMI, but no significant association was observed after accounting for BMI. The area under the ROC curve was 0.6281 (0.597-0.660). In subgroup analysis, there was an inverse significant association between TyG index and sarcopenia among male participants. In mediation analyses, BMI explained 88.7 % of the association of TyG index and sarcopenia. Our findings indicated that TyG index was negatively associated with incident sarcopenia in older Chinese without considering BMI adjustment.

We aimed to advance a novel approach to better characterize epileptogenicity and investigate whether the EZ encompasses a broader epileptogenic network (EpiNet) beyond the seizure zone (SZ) that exhibits seizure activity. We first used computational modeling to test putative complex systems-driven and systems neuroscience-driven mechanistic biomarkers for epileptogenicity. We then used these biomarkers to extract features from resting-state stereoelectroencephalograms recorded from DRE patients and trained supervised classifiers to localize the SZ against gold standard clinical localization. To further explore the prevalence of pathological features in an extended brain network outside of the clinically identified SZ, we also used unsupervised classification. Supervised SZ classification trained on individual features achieved accuracies of .6-.7 area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Combining all criticality and synchrony features further improved the AUC to .85. Unsupervised classification discovered an EpiNet-like cluster of brain regions, in which 51% of brain regions were outside of the SZ. Brain regions in the EpiNet-like cluster engaged in interareal hypersynchrony and locally exhibited high-amplitude bistability and excessive inhibition, which was strikingly similar to the high seizure risk regime revealed by our computational modeling. The finding that combining biomarkers improves SZ localization accuracy indicates that the novel mechanistic biomarkers for epileptogenicity employed here yield synergistic information. On the other hand, the discovery of SZ-like brain dynamics outside of the clinically defined SZ provides empirical evidence of an extended pathophysiological EpiNet.","20240430","Epilepsia","Neuroscience Center, Helsinki Institute of Life Science, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland."

To the best of our knowledge, no studies have evaluated the lymphatic transport of therapeutics from the brain. The objective of this study was to determine the lymphatic transport of model therapeutics of different molecular weights and lipophilicity from the brain using cervical lymph cannulation and ligation models in rats. To do this, anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats were cannulated at the carotid artery and cannulated, ligated, or left intact at the cervical lymph duct. Rats were administered 14C-ibuprofen (206.29 g/mol, logP 3.84), 3H-halofantrine HCl (536.89 g/mol, logP 8.06), or 3H-albumin (∼65,000 g/mol) via direct injection into the brain striatum at a rate of 0.5 μL/min over 16 min. Plasma or cervical lymph samples were collected for up to 6-8 h following dosing, and brain and lymph nodes were collected at 6 or 8 h. Samples were subsequently analyzed for radioactivity levels via scintillation counting. For 14C-ibuprofen, plasma concentrations over time (plasma AUC0-6h) were >2 fold higher in lymph-ligated rats than in lymph-intact rats, suggesting that ibuprofen is cleared from the brain primarily via nonlymphatic routes (e.g., across the blood-brain barrier) but that this clearance is influenced by changes in lymphatic flow. For 3H-halofantrine, >73% of the dose was retained at the brain dosing site in lymph-intact and lymph-ligated groups, and plasma AUC0-8h values were low in both groups (<0.3% dose.h/mL), consistent with the high retention in the brain. It was therefore not possible to determine whether halofantrine undergoes lymphatic transport from the brain within the duration of the study. For 3H-albumin, plasma AUC0-8h values were not significantly different between lymph-intact, lymph-ligated, and lymph-cannulated rats. However, >4% of the dose was recovered in cervical lymph over 8 h. Lymph/plasma concentration ratios of 3H-albumin were also very high (up to 53:1). Together, these results indicate that 3H-albumin is transported from the brain not only via lymphatic routes but also via the blood. Similar to other tissues, the lymphatics may thus play a significant role in the transport of macromolecules, including therapeutic proteins, from the brain but are unlikely to be a major transport pathway from the brain for small molecule drugs that are not lipophilic. Our rat cervical lymph cannulation model can be used to quantify the lymphatic drainage of different molecules and factors from the brain.","20240405","Molecular pharmaceutics","Drug Delivery, Disposition and Dynamics, Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Monash University, Parkville, Victoria 3052, Australia."

We evaluated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and immune infiltration landscape in atherosclerosis using microarray datasets and bioinformatics analysis. By intersecting PANoptosis-related genes from the GeneCards database with DEGs, we obtained a set of PANoptosis-related genes in atherosclerosis (PANoDEGs). Functional enrichment analysis of PANoDEGs was performed and protein-protein interaction (PPI) network of PANoDEGs was established. The machine learning algorithms were used to identify the key PANoDEGs closely linked to atherosclerosis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to assess the diagnostic potency of key PANoDEGs. CIBERSORT was used to analyze the immune infiltration patterns in atherosclerosis, and the Spearman method was used to study the relationship between key PANoDEGs and immune infiltration abundance. The single gene enrichment analysis of key PANoDEGs was investigated by GSEA. The transcription factors and target miRNAs of key PANoDEGs were predicted by Cytoscape and online database, respectively. The expression of key PANoDEGs was validated through animal and cell experiments. PANoDEGs in atherosclerosis were significantly enriched in apoptotic process, pyroptosis, necroptosis, cytosolic DNA-sensing pathway, NOD-like receptor signaling pathway, lipid and atherosclerosis. Four key PANoDEGs (ZBP1, SNHG6, DNM1L, and AIM2) were found to be closely related to atherosclerosis. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that the key PANoDEGs had a strong diagnostic potential in distinguishing atherosclerotic samples from control samples. Immune cell infiltration analysis revealed that the proportion of initial B cells, plasma cells, CD4 memory resting T cells, and M1 macrophages was significantly higher in atherosclerotic tissues compared to normal tissues. Spearman analysis showed that key PANoDEGs showed strong correlations with immune cells such as T cells, macrophages, plasma cells, and mast cells. The regulatory networks of the four key PANoDEGs were established. The expression of key PANoDEGs was verified in further cell and animal experiments.

In response to this need, our study collected comprehensive, longitudinal multimodal data from 48 TBI patients across multiple participating institutions. A supervised binary classification task was created, contrasting data from LPTS patients with those without LPTS. To accommodate missing modalities in some subjects, we took a two-pronged approach. Firstly, we extended a graphical model-based Bayesian estimator to directly classify subjects with incomplete modality. Secondly, we explored conventional imputation techniques. The imputed multimodal information was then combined, following several fusion and dimensionality reduction techniques found in the literature, and subsequently fitted to a kernel- or a tree-based classifier. For this fusion, we proposed two new algorithms: recursive elimination of correlated components (RECC) that filters information based on the correlation between the already selected features, and information decomposition and selective fusion (IDSF), which effectively recombines information from decomposed multimodal features. Our cross-validation findings showed that the proposed IDSF algorithm delivers superior performance based on the area under the curve (AUC) score. Ultimately, after rigorous statistical comparisons and interpretable machine learning examination using Shapley values of the most frequently selected features, we recommend the two following magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) abnormalities as potential biomarkers: the left anterior limb of internal capsule in diffusion MRI (dMRI), and the right middle temporal gyrus in functional MRI (fMRI).","20240419","Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society","Cognitive Systems Lab, Dept. of Electrical and Computer Engineering, College of Engineering, Northeastern University, 360 Huntington Ave, Boston, MA 02115, United States of America.

For this retrospective cohort study, data of patients that underwent CRS-HIPEC for colorectal PM from four Dutch HIPEC centers were used. Exclusion criteria were perioperative systemic therapy and peritoneal cancer index (PCI) ≥20. Nine previously identified factors were considered as predictors: gender, age, primary tumor characteristics (location, nodal stage, differentiation, and mutation status), synchronous liver metastases, preoperative Carcino-Embryonal Antigen (CEA), and peritoneal cancer index (PCI). The prediction model was developed using multivariable Cox regression and validated internally using bootstrapping. The performance of the model was evaluated by discrimination and calibration. In total, 408 patients were included. During the follow-up, recurrence of disease occurred in 318 patients (78%). Significant predictors of recurrence were PCI (HR 1.075, 95% CI 1.044-1.108) and primary tumor location (left sided HR 0.719, 95% CI 0.550-0.939). The prediction model for recurrence showed fair discrimination with a C-index of 0.64 (95% CI 0.62, 0.66) after internal validation.

Contrast media injection phase information is usually missing on public datasets and not standardized in the clinic even in the same region and language. This is a barrier to effective use of available CECT images in clinical research. The aim of this study is to detect contrast media injection phase from CT images by means of organ segmentation and machine learning algorithms. A total number of 2509 CT images split into four subsets of non-contrast (class #0), arterial (class #1), venous (class #2), and delayed (class #3) after contrast media injection were collected from two CT scanners. Seven organs including the liver, spleen, heart, kidneys, lungs, urinary bladder, and aorta along with body contour masks were generated by pre-trained deep learning algorithms. Subsequently, five first-order statistical features including average, standard deviation, 10, 50, and 90 percentiles extracted from the above-mentioned masks were fed to machine learning models after feature selection and reduction to classify the CT images in one of four above mentioned classes. A 10-fold data split strategy was followed. The performance of our methodology was evaluated in terms of classification accuracy metrics. The best performance was achieved by Boruta feature selection and RF model with average area under the curve of more than 0.999 and accuracy of 0.9936 averaged over four classes and 10 folds. Boruta feature selection selected all predictor features. The lowest classification was observed for class #2 (0.9888), which is already an excellent result. In the 10-fold strategy, only 33 cases from 2509 cases (∼1.4%) were misclassified. The performance over all folds was consistent. We developed a fast, accurate, reliable, and explainable methodology to classify contrast media phases which may be useful in data curation and annotation in big online datasets or local datasets with non-standard or no series description.

The objective of this study was to translate the FAM-CAM into a Chinese version and to verify its effectiveness for delirium detection in an online patient visit setting. This was a cross-sectional study. The FAM-CAM was translated to Chinese according to the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research guidelines. Patients and family members were recruited to participate in delirium assessments in three ICUs of one hospital. Family members then used the Chinese version of the FAM-CAM to assess for delirium via online visitation, and ICU nurses assessed patients for delirium using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist (ICDSC). Results were then compared between family members' and nurses' assessments. Overall, 190 critically ill patients and 190 family members were included, of whom 117 (61.6%) were assessed for delirium using the Intensive Care Delirium Screening Checklist.

The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that, compared with that in the low-stable uACR group, the incidence of MACE in the high-stable (HR = 1.337, 95% CI = 1.083-1.652, p = 0.007) and elevated-increasing (HR = 1.648, 95% CI = 1.139-2.387, p = 0.009) uACR groups significantly increased. Similar results were observed for HHF, non-fatal AMI, and acute renal injury/dialysis indications (p < 0.05). The multivariate Cox proportional hazards models indicated that, after adjusting for potential confounders, the HRs for the risk of MACE were 1.145 (p = 0.132), 1.337 (p = 0.007), and 1.648 (p = 0.009) in the moderate-stable, high-stable, and elevated-increasing uACR groups, respectively. In addition, the HRs for the risk of MACE were 1.203 (p = 0.028), 0.872 (p = 0.024), 1.562 (p = 0.033), and 2.218 (p = 0.002) in the moderate-stable, moderate-decreasing, high-stable, and elevated-increasing groups, respectively. The ROC curve showed that, after adding uACR, HbA1c, or both, the AUCs were 0.773, 0.792, and 0.826, which all signified statistically significant improvements (p = 0.021, 0.035, and 0.019, respectively). A long-term elevated uACR is associated with a significantly increased risk of MACE in patients with diabetes. This study implies that regular monitoring of uACR could be helpful in identifying diabetic patients with a higher risk of MACE.","20240429","Frontiers in endocrinology","Department of Cardiology, First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, China."

In this prospective study, patients with migraine (n = 145) were requested to fill out a headache diary, the Arabic version of HIT-6, and Migraine Disability Assessment Scale (MIDAS) at two time points (baseline and 3 months after initiation of prophylactic treatment). Some respondents (n = 73) were requested to fill out HIT-6 again 1 week from the baseline for test-retest reliability. The intensity of migraine headache attacks was evaluated using the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). An anchor-based method was used to establish the minimal important change (MIC) value and responsiveness of HIT-6. The total scores of HIT-6 were significantly correlated to a fair degree with MIDAS (r = 0.41), as well as VAS (r = 0.53), and monthly migraine days (r = 0.38) at the baseline while at the follow-up (after 3 months), the correlations were of moderate degree with MIDAS scores (r = 0.62) and monthly migraine days (r = 0.60; convergent validity).

The study involved 6 validated AI algorithms, each trained to predict future development of atrial fibrillation, aortic stenosis, low ejection fraction, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, amyloid heart disease, and biological age. These algorithms' outputs based on a single preoperative ECG were correlated with patient mortality data. Among 6504 KT recipients included in the study, 1764 (27.1%) died within a median follow-up of 5.7 y (interquartile range: 3.00-9.29 y). All AI-ECG algorithms were independently associated with long-term all-cause mortality ( P < 0.001). Notably, few patients had a clinical cardiac diagnosis at the time of transplant, indicating that AI-ECG scores were predictive even in asymptomatic patients.

Accurate subtype classification of tumors plays a crucial role in formulating effective treatment plans for patients. Notably, lymphoma comprises subtypes like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin's lymphoma, while lung cancer encompasses adenocarcinoma, small cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma. Similarly, liver cancer consists of subtypes such as cholangiocarcinoma and hepatocellular carcinoma. Consequently, the subtype classification of tumors based on PET images holds immense clinical significance. However, in clinical practice, the number of cases available for each subtype is often limited and imbalanced. Therefore, the primary challenge lies in achieving precise subtype classification using a small dataset. This paper presents a novel approach for tumor subtype classification in small datasets using RA-DL (Radiomics-DeepLearning) attention. To address the limited sample size, Support Vector Machines (SVM) is employed as the classifier for tumor subtypes instead of deep learning methods. Emphasizing the importance of texture information in tumor subtype recognition, radiomics features are extracted from the tumor regions during the feature extraction stage. These features are compressed using an autoencoder to reduce redundancy. In addition to radiomics features, deep features are also extracted from the tumors to leverage the feature extraction capabilities of deep learning. In contrast to existing methods, our proposed approach utilizes the RA-DL-Attention mechanism to guide the deep network in extracting complementary deep features that enhance the expressive capacity of the final features while minimizing redundancy. To address the challenges of limited and imbalanced data, our method avoids using classification labels during deep feature extraction and instead incorporates 2D Region of Interest (ROI) segmentation and image reconstruction as auxiliary tasks. Subsequently, all lesion features of a single patient are aggregated into a feature vector using a multi-instance aggregation layer. Validation experiments were conducted on three PET datasets, specifically the liver cancer dataset, lung cancer dataset, and lymphoma dataset. In the context of lung cancer, our proposed method achieved impressive performance with Area Under Curve (AUC) values of 0.82, 0.84, and 0.83 for the three-classification task. For the binary classification task of lymphoma, our method demonstrated notable results with AUC values of 0.95 and 0.75. Moreover, in the binary classification task of liver tumor, our method exhibited promising performance with AUC values of 0.84 and 0.86. The experimental results clearly indicate that our proposed method outperforms alternative approaches significantly. Through the extraction of complementary radiomics features and deep features, our method achieves a substantial improvement in tumor subtype classification performance using small PET datasets.","20240409","Computers in biology and medicine","Software College, Northeastern University, Shenyang 110819, China."

This study aims to design and evaluate a machine learning model to predict one-year mortality after a stroke. Data from the National Multiethnic Stroke Registry was utilized. Eight machine learning (ML) models were trained and evaluated using various metrics. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis was used to identify the influential predictors. The final analysis included 9840 patients diagnosed with stroke were included in the study. The XGBoost algorithm exhibited optimal performance with high accuracy (94.5%) and AUC (87.3%). Core predictors encompassed National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) at admission, age, hospital length of stay, mode of arrival, heart rate, and blood pressure. Increased NIHSS, age, and longer stay correlated with higher mortality. Ambulance arrival and lower diastolic blood pressure and lower body mass index predicted poorer outcomes. This model's predictive capacity emphasizes the significance of NIHSS, age, hospital stay, arrival mode, heart rate, blood pressure, and BMI in stroke mortality prediction. Specific findings suggest avenues for data quality enhancement, registry expansion, and real-world validation. The study underscores machine learning's potential for early mortality prediction, improving risk assessment, and personalized care.

Developing new, efficient, and safe small-molecule kinase inhibitors has become an important topic in the field of drug research and development. In contrast with traditional wet experiments which are time-consuming and expensive, machine learning-based approaches for predicting small molecule inhibitors for protein kinases are time-saving and cost-effective, which are highly desired for us. However, the issue of sample scarcity (known active and inactive compounds are usually limited for most kinases) poses a challenge to the research and development of machine learning-based kinase inhibitors' active prediction methods. To alleviate the data scarcity problem in the prediction of kinase inhibitors, in this study, we present a novel Meta-learning-based inductive logistic matrix completion method for the Prediction of Kinase Inhibitors (MetaILMC). MetaILMC adopts a meta-learning framework to learn a well-generalized model from tasks with sufficient samples, which can fast adapt to new tasks with limited samples. As MetaILMC allows the effective transfer of the prior knowledge learned from kinases with sufficient samples to kinases with a small number of samples, the proposed model can produce accurate predictions for kinases with limited data. Experimental results show that MetaILMC has excellent performance for prediction tasks of kinases with few-shot samples and is significantly superior to the state-of-the-art multi-task learning in terms of AUC, AUPR, etc., various performance metrics. Case studies also provided for two drugs to predict Kinase Inhibitory scores, further validating the proposed method's effectiveness and feasibility. SCIENTIFIC CONTRIBUTION: Considering the potential correlation between activity prediction tasks for different kinases, we propose a novel meta learning algorithm MetaILMC, which learns a prior of strong generalization capacity during meta-training from the tasks with sufficient training samples, such that it can be easily and quickly adapted to the new tasks of the kinase with scarce data during meta-testing. Thus, MetaILMC can effectively alleviate the data scarcity problem in the prediction of kinase inhibitors.","20240416","Journal of cheminformatics","School of Software, Yunnan University, Kunming, 650091, China."

A retrospective collection of 345 patients with TBI, and they were divided into malnutrition and comparison groups according to the occurrence of malnutrition. Univariate correlation and multifactor logistic regression analyses were performed to determine patients' malnutrition risk factors. We used univariate and logistic regression (forward stepwise method) analyses to identify significant predictors associated with malnutrition in patients with TBI and developed a predictive model for malnutrition prediction.

Here, we present a comprehensive study of how parental status and number of children born/fathered links to markers of brain and cellular ageing in 36,323 UK Biobank participants (age range 44.57-82.06 years; 52% female). To assess global effects of parenting on the brain, we trained a 3D convolutional neural network on T1-weighted magnetic resonance images, and estimated brain age in a held-out test set. To investigate regional specificity, we extracted cortical and subcortical volumes using FreeSurfer, and ran hierarchical clustering to group regional volumes based on covariance. Leukocyte telomere length (LTL) derived from DNA was used as a marker of cellular ageing. We employed linear regression models to assess relationships between number of children, brain age, regional brain volumes, and LTL, and included interaction terms to probe sex differences in associations. Lastly, we used the brain measures and LTL as features in binary classification models, to determine if markers of brain and cellular ageing could predict parental status. The results showed associations between a greater number of children born/fathered and younger brain age in both females and males, with stronger effects observed in females. Volume-based analyses showed maternal effects in striatal and limbic regions, which were not evident in fathers. We found no evidence for associations between number of children and LTL. Classification of parental status showed an Area under the ROC Curve (AUC) of 0.57 for the brain age model, while the models using regional brain volumes and LTL as predictors showed AUCs of 0.52. Our findings align with previous population-based studies of middle- and older-aged parents, revealing subtle but significant associations between parental experience and neuroimaging-based surrogate markers of brain health. The findings further corroborate results from longitudinal cohort studies following parents across pregnancy and postpartum, potentially indicating that the parenthood transition is associated with long-term influences on brain health.","20240402","Psychoneuroendocrinology","Department of Clinical Neurosciences, Lausanne University Hospital (CHUV) and University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland; Department of Psychology, University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway; Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK.

Cuproptosis is regulated by multiple genes and is crucial to the progression of ESCA. However, it is not yet clear what role the cuproptosis-associated lncRNAs (CuALs) play in ESCA. To tackle this problem, a prognostic signature incorporating three CuALs was created. This signature was constructed by the use of the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariate Cox regression. Subsequently, the signature effectively stratified ESCA samples into a high-risk group and a low-risk group. Those in the low-risk group demonstrated extended overall survival (OS), as well as increased infiltration of T cells, macrophages, and NK cells, suggesting a potentially enhanced response to immunotherapy. The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that this prognostic signature outperformed conventional clinical factors in predicting patient prognosis (AUC = 0.708). K-M survival analysis and correlation analysis identified UGDH-AS1 (a CuAL) as a protective factor positively associated with patient prognosis. The results of RT-qPCR and wound healing assays indicated that UGDH-AS1 is overexpressed in ESCA and could inhibit cancer cell migration.

The SRS spatial dose distribution (Dmap) of each BM was registered to the planning contrast-enhanced T1 (T1-CE) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Axial slices of the Dmap, T1-CE, and planning target volume (PTV) segmentation (PTVseg) intersecting the BM center were extracted within a fixed field of view determined by the 60% isodose volume in Dmap. A spherical projection was implemented to transform planar image content onto a spherical surface using multiple projection centers, and the resultant T1-CE/Dmap/PTVseg projections were stacked as a 3-channel variable. Four Visual Geometry Group (VGG-19) deep encoders were used in an ensemble design, with each submodel using a different spherical projection formula as input for BM outcome prediction. In each submodel, clinical features after positional encoding were fused with VGG-19 deep features to generate logit results. The ensemble's outcome was synthesized from the 4 submodel results via logistic regression.

For the discovery phase, untargeted proteomics analysis was performed using single window acquisition of all theoretical mass spectra to identify blood proteins differentially abundant in samples from children with and without delayed recovery from concussion. A subset of these proteins was then validated in a separate participant cohort using multiple reaction monitoring and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. A blood protein signature predictive of delayed recovery from concussion was modeled using a Support Vector Machine, a machine learning approach. In the discovery phase, 22 blood proteins were differentially abundant in age- and sex-matched samples from children with (n = 9) and without (n = 9) delayed recovery from concussion, six of whom were chosen for validation. In the validation phase, alpha-1-ACT was shown to be significantly lower in children with delayed recovery (n = 12) compared with those without delayed recovery (n = 28), those with orthopedic injuries (n = 7) and healthy controls (n = 33). A model consisting of alpha-1-ACT concentration stratified children based on recovery from concussion with an 0.88 area under the curve. We have identified that alpha-1-ACT differentiates between children at risk of delayed recovery from those without delayed recovery from concussion.

This retrospective study analyzed data from 396 patients who underwent surgical procedures for colon cancer (CC) between 2010 and 2021. Machine learning algorithms were employed to predict CC recurrence, with a focus on demographic, clinicopathological, and laboratory characteristics. A range of evaluation metrics, including AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic), accuracy, recall, precision, and F1 scores, assessed the performance of machine learning algorithms. Significant risk factors for CC recurrence were identified, including sex, carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels, tumor location, depth, lymphatic and venous invasion, and lymph node involvement. The CatBoost Classifier demonstrated exceptional performance, achieving an AUC of 0.92 and an accuracy of 88 % on the test dataset. Feature importance analysis highlighted the significance of CEA levels, albumin levels, N stage, weight, platelet count, height, neutrophil count, lymphocyte count, and gender in determining recurrence risk. The integration of machine learning into healthcare, exemplified by this study's findings, offers a pathway to personalized patient risk stratification and enhanced clinical decision-making. Early identification of individuals at risk of CC recurrence holds the potential for more effective therapeutic interventions and improved patient outcomes. Machine learning has the potential to revolutionize our approach to CC recurrence prediction, emphasizing the synergy between medical expertise and cutting-edge technology in the fight against cancer. This study represents a vital step toward precision medicine in CC management, showcasing the transformative power of data-driven insights in oncology.","20240419","Surgical oncology","Department of Medical Oncology, Suleyman Demirel University, Isparta, Turkey.

Although the usefulness of gait assessment using inertial measurement devices has been reported, its accuracy in discriminating gait independence in patients hospitalized for subacute stroke has not yet been validated. Can trunk acceleration indices discriminate between dependent and independent walking in patients with subacute stroke? Thirty-five patients with subacute stroke (mean ± standard deviation, 75.5 ± 9.8 years, 19 males), who were able to understand instructions, had a premorbid modified Rankin scale <3, and were able to walk 16 m straight ahead under supervision were included. The stride regularity, harmonic ratio, and normalized root mean square of trunk accelerations were measured in three directions (mediolateral, vertical, and anterioposterior) during comfortable walking. The Functional Ambulation Categories were used as the dependent variable to classify the patients into two groups (dependent and independent walking groups), and each trunk acceleration index was used as the independent variable to calculate the area under the curve using receiver operating characteristic curves. Twelve patients were in the dependent group and 23 were in the independent group. The normalized root mean square in both the mediolateral and vertical directions were excellent discriminators of walking independence, with an area under the curve greater than 0.8. The cutoff values (sensitivity/specificity) were 2.20 m2/s2 (0.783/0.833) and 2.82 m2/s2 (0.739/0.833), respectively. The magnitude of vertical and lateral acceleration during gait in patients with subacute stroke, has excellent accuracy in discriminating between dependent and independent gaits.

Currently, most existing methods ignore the regulatory relationships between genes and thus have unsatisfactory predictive performance. In this paper, we propose to predict anti-tumor drug efficacy via learning the activity representation of tumor cells based on a priori knowledge of gene regulation networks (GRNs). Specifically, the method simulates the cellular biosystem by synthesizing a cell-gene activity network and then infers a new low-dimensional activity representation for tumor cells from the raw high-dimensional expression profile. The simulated cell-gene network mainly comprises known gene regulatory networks collected from multiple resources and fuses tumor cells by linking them to hotspot genes that are over- or under-expressed in them. The resulting activity representation could not only reflect the shallow expression profile (hotspot genes) but also mines in-depth information of gene regulation activity in tumor cells before treatment. Finally, we build deep learning models on the activity representation for predicting drug efficacy in tumor cells. Experimental results on the benchmark GDSC dataset demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed method over SOTA methods with the highest AUC of 0.954 in the efficacy label prediction and the best R2 of 0.834 in the regression of half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC50) values, suggesting the potential value of the proposed method in practice.","20240402","Artificial intelligence in medicine","School of mathematics and physics, Anhui Jianzhu University, Hefei, China."

It used an 18fluorine-fluorodeoxyglucose-PET-based, pathological complete response (pCR)-adapted strategy. PHERGain was a randomised, open-label, phase 2 trial that took place in 45 hospitals in seven European countries. It randomly allocated patients in a 1:4 ratio with centrally confirmed, HER2-positive, stage I-IIIA invasive, operable breast cancer with at least one PET-evaluable lesion to either group A, where patients received docetaxel (75 mg/m2, intravenous), carboplatin (area under the curve 6 mg/mL per min, intravenous), trastuzumab (600 mg fixed dose, subcutaneous), and pertuzumab (840 mg loading dose followed by 420 mg maintenance doses, intravenous; TCHP), or group B, where patients received trastuzumab and pertuzumab with or without endocrine therapy, every 3 weeks. Random allocation was stratified by hormone receptor status. Centrally reviewed PET was conducted at baseline and after two treatment cycles. Patients in group B were treated according to on-treatment PET results. Patients in group B who were PET-responders continued with trastuzumab and pertuzumab with or without endocrine therapy for six cycles, while PET-non-responders were switched to receive six cycles of TCHP. After surgery, patients in group B who were PET-responders who did not achieve a pCR received six cycles of TCHP, and all patients completed up to 18 cycles of trastuzumab and pertuzumab. The primary endpoints were pCR in patients who were group B PET-responders after two treatment cycles (the results for which have been reported previously) and 3-year invasive disease-free survival (iDFS) in patients in group B. The study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03161353) and is ongoing.

At this second analysis (data cutoff: Nov 4, 2022), the median duration of follow-up was 43·3 months (range 0·0-63·0). In group B, the 3-year iDFS rate was 94·8% (95% CI 91·4-97·1; p=0·001), meeting the primary endpoint. No new safety signals were identified. Treatment-related adverse events and serious adverse events (SAEs) were numerically higher in patients allocated to group A than to group B (grade ≥3 62% vs 33%; SAEs 28% vs 14%). Group B PET-responders with pCR presented the lowest incidence of treatment-related grade 3 or higher adverse events (1%) without any SAEs.

Of these patients, 93 were mildly ill and had follow-up examinations in 7 days, and 61 of them had enlarged lesions on CT scans. We collected the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and three quantitative CT features from two examinations within 7 days. The three quantitative CT features of pneumonia lesions, including ground-glass opacity volume (GV), semi-consolidation volume (SV), and consolidation volume (CV), were automatically calculated using AI. Additionally, the variation volumes of the lesions were also computed. Finally, a nomogram was developed using a multivariable logistic regression model. To simplify the model, we classified all the lesion volumes based on quartiles and curve fitting results. Among the 93 patients, 61 patients showed enlarged lesions on CT within 7 days, of whom 19 (31.1%) developed any severe illness.

To go beyond the deficiencies of the three conventional multimodal fusion strategies (i.e. input-, feature- and output-level fusion), we propose a bidirectional attention-aware fluid pyramid feature integrated fusion network (BAF-Net) with cross-modal interactions for multimodal medical image diagnosis and prognosis.Approach. BAF-Net is composed of two identical branches to preserve the unimodal features and one bidirectional attention-aware distillation stream to progressively assimilate cross-modal complements and to learn supplementary features in both bottom-up and top-down processes. Fluid pyramid connections were adopted to integrate the hierarchical features at different levels of the network, and channel-wise attention modules were exploited to mitigate cross-modal cross-level incompatibility. Furthermore, depth-wise separable convolution was introduced to fuse the cross-modal cross-level features to alleviate the increase in parameters to a great extent. The generalization abilities of BAF-Net were evaluated in terms of two clinical tasks: (1) an in-house PET-CT dataset with 174 patients for differentiation between lung cancer and pulmonary tuberculosis.

Gout is an arthritic disease caused by the deposition of monosodium urate crystal (MSU) in the joints, which can lead to acute inflammation and damage adjacent tissue. Hyperuricemia is the main risk factor for MSU crystal deposition and gout. With the increasing burden of gout disease, the identification of potential biomarkers and novel targets for diagnosis is urgently needed. For the analysis of this subject paper, we downloaded the human gout data set GSE160170 and the gout mouse model data set GSE190138 from the GEO database. To obtain the differentially expressed genes (DEGs), we intersected the two data sets. Using the cytohubba algorithm, we identified the key genes and enriched them through GO and KEGG. The gene expression trends of three subgroups (normal control group, intermittent gout group and acute gout attack group) were analyzed by Series Test of Cluster (STC) analysis, and the key genes were screened out, and the diagnostic effect was verified by ROC curve. The expression of key genes in dorsal root nerve and spinal cord of gout mice was analyzed. Finally, the clinical samples of normal control group, hyperuricemia group, intermittent gout group and acute gout attack group were collected, and the expression of key genes at protein level was verified by ELISA. We obtained 59 co-upregulated and 28 co-downregulated genes by comparing the DEGs between gout mouse model data set and human gout data set. 7 hub DEGs(IL1B, IL10, NLRP3, SOCS3, PTGS2) were screened out via Cytohubba algorithm. The results of both GO and KEGG enrichment analyses indicate that 7 hub genes play a significant role in regulating the inflammatory response, cytokine production in immune response, and the TNF signaling pathway. The most representative hub genes SOCS3 and PTGS2 were screened out by Series Test of Cluster, and ROC analysis results showed the AUC values were both up to 1.000. In addition, we found that PTGS2 expression was significantly elevated in the dorsal root ganglia and spinal cord in monosodium urate(MSU)-induced gout mouse model. The ELISA results revealed that the expression of SOCS3 and PTGS2 was notably higher in the acute gout attack and intermittent gout groups compared to the normal control group. This difference was statistically significant, indicating a clear distinction between the groups.

The overall DNA methylation levels were analysed by using MethlTarget™ DNA Methylation Analysis platform in a discovery set consistent of 50 sarcopenic older adults (aged ≥65 years) and 50 age- and sex-matched non-sarcopenic individuals. The candidate differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were further validated by Methylation-specific PCR (MSP) in another two independent larger sets and confirmed by pyrosequencing. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to determine the optimum cut-off levels of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)_30 methylation best predicting sarcopenia and area under the ROC curve (AUC) was measured. The correlation between candidate DMRs and the risk of sarcopenia was investigated by univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Among 1149 cytosine-phosphate-guanine (CpG) sites of 27 skeletal muscle function-related secretary factors, 17 differentially methylated CpG sites and 7 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) were detected between patients with sarcopenia and control subjects in the discovery set. Further methylation-specific PCR identified that methylation of fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2)_30 was lower in patients with sarcopenia and the level was decreased as the severity of sarcopenia increased, which was confirmed by pyrosequencing. Correlation analysis demonstrated that the methylation level of FGF2_30 was positively correlated to ASMI (r = 0.372, P < 0.001), grip strength (r = 0.334, P < 0.001), and gait speed (r = 0.411, P < 0.001).

All included infants had known 2-year outcomes (45 with spastic CP and 30 without CP) including Gross Motor Functional Classification System (GMFCS) levels and CP body distribution. Receiver operating characteristic curves and cut points indicating greatest sensitivity and specificity were generated for predictive performance. Total BabyOSCAR score was a strong predictor of future outcome of spastic CP (cut score of 22.5, sensitivity = 98%, specificity = 100%, area under the curve = 0.99), and was able to distinguish children classified in GMFCS levels I and II from those in III to V (cut score of 13.5, sensitivity = 92%, specificity = 89%, area under the curve = 0.94). Having an (absolute) asymmetry score on the BabyOSCAR of more than 5 was a predictor of having unilateral CP at age 2 years (sensitivity = 56%, specificity = 100%, area under the curve = 0.86). BabyOSCAR scores are predictors of diagnosis, body distribution, and future gross motor function in infants with spastic CP at 2 years of age or later. Decreased independent joint movement at 3 months predicts spastic cerebral palsy (CP) at 2 years. Baby Observational Selective Control AppRaisal (BabyOSCAR) scores ≤13 are predictive of Gross Motor Function Classification System (GMFCS) levels III to V. BabyOSCAR scores of 14 to 22 are predictive of GMFCS levels I and II. A BabyOSCAR total asymmetry score >5 predicts unilateral CP. Stereotyped movements are more prominent in those who will be diagnosed with spastic CP at 2 years.","20240417","Developmental medicine and child neurology","Department of Physical Therapy and Human Movement Sciences, Feinberg School of Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, USA."

The aim of this study was to provide a detailed description of the tumor microenvironment (TME) of ONCOFID-P-B™-treated BCG-unresponsive bladder CIS patients enrolled in the NCT04798703 phase I study, in order to identify predictive biomarkers of response. The composition and spatial interactions of tumor-infiltrating immune cells and the expression of the most relevant hyaluronic acid (HA) receptors on cancer cells, were analyzed in biopsies from the 20 patients enrolled in the NCT04798703 phase I study collected before starting ONCOFID-P-B™ therapy (baseline), and after the intensive and the maintenance phases. Clinical data were correlated with cell densities, cell distribution and cell interactions. Associations between immune populations or HA receptors expression and outcome were analyzed using univariate Cox regression and log-rank analysis. In baseline biopsies, patients achieving CR after the intensive phase had a lower density of intra-tumoral CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), but also fewer interactions between CTL and macrophages or T-regulatory cells, as compared to non-responders (NR). NR expressed higher levels of the HA receptors CD44v6, ICAM-1 and RHAMM. The intra-tumoral macrophage density was positively correlated with the expression of the pro-metastatic and aggressive variant CD44v6, and the combined score of intra-tumoral macrophage density and CD44v6 expression had an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI 0.68-1.00) for patient response prediction. The clinical response to ONCOFID-P-B™ in bladder CIS likely relies on several components of the TME, and the combined evaluation of intra-tumoral macrophages density and CD44v6 expression is a potentially new predictive biomarker for patient response. Overall, our data allow to advance a potential rationale for combinatorial treatments targeting the immune infiltrate such as immune checkpoint inhibitors, to make bladder CIS more responsive to ONCOFID-P-B™ treatment.","20240410","Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR","Immunology and Molecular Oncology Diagnostics, Veneto Institute of Oncology IOV-IRCCS, Via Gattamelata 64, 35128, Padova, Italy. anna.tosi@iov.veneto.it."

Then, three machine learning algorithms, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator, support vector machine recursive feature elimination, and random forest were used to screen and obtain four shared candidate markers, including ACADL, EMP2, GPD1L, and HMMR. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the area under the curve for distinguishing normal mesothelial cells from mesothelioma was 0.976, 0.943, 0.962, and 0.956, respectively. The expression and diagnostic performance of these candidate genes were validated in two additional independent data sets (GSE42977 and GSE112154), indicating that the performances of ACADL, GPD1L, and HMMR were consistent between the training and validation data sets. Finally, the optimal candidate marker ACADL was verified by immunohistochemistry assay. Acyl-CoA dehydrogenase long chain (ACADL) was stained strongly in mesothelial cells, especially for reactive hyperplasic mesothelial cells, but was negative in malignant mesothelioma cells.

In such situations, concerns have been expressed by regulatory authorities that the common application of single slope analysis models may induce Type I error inflation. This article aims to offer practical advice and guidance, including SAS codes, on the statistical methodology to be employed in an eGFR rate of change analysis and offers guidance on trial design considerations for eGFR endpoints. A two-slope statistical model for eGFR data over time is proposed allowing for an analysis to simultaneously evaluate short term acute effects and long term chronic effects. A simulation study was conducted under a range of credible null and alternative hypotheses to evaluate the performance of the two-slope model in comparison to commonly used single slope random coefficients models as well as to non-slope based analyses of change from baseline or time normalized area under the curve (TAUC). Importantly, and contrary to preexisting concerns, these simulations demonstrate the absence of alpha inflation associated with the use of single or two-slope random coefficient models, even when such models are misspecified, and highlight that any concern regarding model misspecification relates to power and not to lack of Type I error control.","20240403","Pharmaceutical statistics","Chinook Therapeutics, Inc., Seattle, Washington, USA."

We compare the 2,103 loci results in non-European ancestries and show significant PRS associations in a large African-American sample. Secondary analyses implicate 500 genes previously unreported for BP.

To accurately diagnose closely related diseases like UCDs, we hypothesize that contextual learning is critical in enhancing the ability of the artificial intelligence models to differentiate the subtle differences in lesions amidst the vastly divergent spatial contexts. White-light colonoscopy datasets of patients with confirmed UCDs and healthy controls were retrospectively collected. We developed a Multiclass Contextual Classification (MCC) model that can differentiate among the mentioned UCDs and healthy controls by incorporating the tissue object contexts surrounding the individual lesion region in a scene and spatial information from other endoscopic frames (video-level) into a unified framework. Internal and external datasets were used to validate the model's performance. Training datasets included 762 patients, and the internal and external testing cohorts included 257 patients and 293 patients, respectively.

Statin use significantly increased the incidence of DN (OR=1.405, 95%CI (1.199,1.647), p<0.001). Individuals who used statins for 5 to 7 years were more likely to develop diabetic nephropathy (OR=1.472, 95%CI (1.057,2.048), p=0.022) compared to those who used statins for 1-3 years (OR=1.334, 95%CI (1.058,1.682), p=0.015) or <1 year (OR=1.266, 95%CI (1.054,1.522), p = 0.012).

The patients were divided into groups using unsupervised time series clustering for five-year BMD loss of Gruen zone 7 postoperatively, and a machine-learning model to predict the BMD loss was developed. Additionally, the predictor for BMD loss was extracted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). The patient-specific efficacy of bisphosphonate, which is the most important categorical predictor for BMD loss, was examined by calculating the change in predictive probability when hypothetically switching between the inclusion and exclusion of bisphosphonate. Time series clustering allowed us to divide the patients into two groups, and the predictive factors were identified including patient- and operation-related factors. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for the BMD loss prediction averaged 0.734. Virtual administration of bisphosphonate showed on average 14% efficacy in preventing BMD loss of zone 7. Additionally, stem types and preoperative triglyceride (TG), creatinine (Cr), estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), and creatine kinase (CK) showed significant association with the estimated patient-specific efficacy of bisphosphonate. Periprosthetic BMD loss after THA is predictable based on patient- and operation-related factors, and optimal prescription of bisphosphonate based on the prediction may prevent BMD loss.","20240418","Bone & joint research","Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, Yokohama City University, Yokohama, Japan."

The accurate survival prediction for CRC patients plays a significant role in the formulation of treatment strategies. Recently, machine learning and deep learning approaches have been increasingly applied in cancer survival prediction. However, most existing methods inadequately represent and leverage the dependencies among features and fail to sufficiently mine and utilize the comorbidity patterns of CRC. To address these issues, we propose a self-attention-based graph learning (SAGL) framework to improve the postoperative cancer-specific survival prediction for CRC patients. We present a novel method for constructing dependency graph (DG) to reflect two types of dependencies including comorbidity-comorbidity dependencies and the dependencies between features related to patient characteristics and cancer treatments. This graph is subsequently refined by a disease comorbidity network, which offers a holistic view of comorbidity patterns of CRC. A DG-guided self-attention mechanism is proposed to unearth novel dependencies beyond what DG offers, thus augmenting CRC survival prediction. Finally, each patient will be represented, and these representations will be used for survival prediction. The experimental results show that SAGL outperforms state-of-the-art methods on a real-world dataset, with the receiver operating characteristic curve for 3- and 5-year survival prediction achieving 0.849±0.002 and 0.895±0.005, respectively. In addition, the comparison results with different graph neural network-based variants demonstrate the advantages of our DG-guided self-attention graph learning framework.

This highlights the necessity for comprehensive, large-scale population studies. Therefore, our objective is to explore the association between PCT levels and various platelet parameters in relation to DKD. In this cross-sectional study, hematological parameter data were collected from a cohort of 4,302 hospitalized Chinese patients. We analyzed the relationships between PCT, platelet count (PLT), mean platelet volume (MPV), platelet distribution width (PDW), platelet large cell ratio (P-LCR), and DKD, along with the urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio (UACR), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was conducted to evaluate the diagnostic potential of these parameters. DKD patients exhibited significantly higher PCT levels compared to those without DKD. Multivariate regression analysis identified elevated PCT and PLT levels as potential independent risk factors for both DKD and UACR, while lower MPV levels might serve as independent protective factors for eGFR. The areas under the ROC curve for PCT in relation to DKD and UACR (≥30 mg/g) were 0.523 and 0.526, respectively. The area under the ROC curve for PLT in relation to UACR (≥30 mg/g) was 0.523. PCT demonstrates a weak diagnostic value for T2DM patients at risk of developing DKD and experiencing proteinuria, and PLT shows a similarly modest diagnostic utility for detecting proteinuria. These insights contribute to a deeper understanding of the complex dynamics involved in DKD.

The performance and interpretations of ML models were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP). In the training cohort, CatBoost algorithms outperformed others with the mean AUCs of 0.908 for LCOS and 0.957 for renal failure, while LightGBM and LR achieved the best mean AUCs of 0.886 for pneumonia and 0.942 for DVT, respectively. In the testing cohort, the best-performing ML model for each major APOs with the following mean AUCs: LCOS (LightGBM), 0.893 (95% CI: 0.884-0.895); pneumonia (LR), 0.929 (95% CI: 0.926-0.931); renal failure (LightGBM), 0.963 (95% CI: 0.947-0.979), and DVT (LightGBM), 0.970 (95% CI: 0.953-0.982). The performance of ML models using only clinical variables was slightly lower than those using combined data, with the mean AUCs of 0.873 for LCOS, 0.894 for pneumonia, 0.953 for renal failure, and 0.933 for DVT. The SHAP showed that mechanical ventilation time was the most important contributor of four major APOs. In pediatric congenital heart surgery, the established ML model can accurately predict the risk of four major APOs, providing reliable interpretations for high-risk contributor identification and informed clinical decisions-making.","20240401","International journal of surgery (London, England)","Department of Anesthesiology."

This positions the GGT/HDL-C ratio as a potential diagnostic indicator for NAFLD. To assess the diagnostic performance of the GGT/HDL-C ratio for NAFLD in adults with obesity undergoing bariatric surgery. We conducted an analytical cross-sectional study, designed as a diagnostic test evaluation. A secondary database of 249 adults with obesity was analyzed. The optimal cut-off point was ascertained using three methodologies, and five adjustment models were constructed for the total population, further stratified by sex. The optimal cut-off point was 20.5 U/mmol and the AUC of the ratio was 0.81 (95% CI: 0.64-0.98), with sensitivity and specificity being 82.5% and 77.8%, respectively. In the overall group with an elevated GGT/HDL-C ratio, the prevalence of NAFLD increased by 14% (PR: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.04-1.33). Specifically, women displaying this altered ratio showed a 19% increased prevalence (PR: 1.19; 95% CI: 1.07-1.42) compared to those with normal values.

For genetic-based prediction, the area under the curve (AUC) was .72; adding sex increased the AUC to .82. Validation in the NewIT cohort confirmed the model's accuracy (.71 without sex, .81 with sex). Individuals in the top group, representing the highest 25%, had a PBC risk approximately 14 times higher than that of the reference group (lowest 25%; p < 10-6).

To assist clinicians in decision-making, we developed a decision support tool using routine data from a precision oncology program.

Thirty participants with type 1 diabetes (≥3 years duration) and 30 control participants were recruited. Groups did not differ in age or sex. After quantification of peak stimulated C-peptide, participants were categorised into those with undetectable (<3 pmol/l), low (3-200 pmol/l) or high (>200 pmol/l) residual beta cell function. Maximal aerobic capacity was assessed by V˙O2peak test and did not differ between control and type 1 diabetes groups. All participants completed 45 min of incline treadmill walking (60% V˙O2peak ) with venous blood taken prior to exercise, immediately post exercise and after 60 min recovery. Serum was analysed using targeted metabolomics. Metabolomic data were analysed by multivariate statistics to define the metabolic phenotype of exercise in type 1 diabetes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to identify circulating metabolomic markers of maximal aerobic capacity ( V˙O2peak ) during exercise in health and type 1 diabetes. Maximal aerobic capacity ( V˙O2peak ) inversely correlated with HbA1c in the type 1 diabetes group (r2=0.17, p=0.024).

A correct diagnosis is important during pregnancy to avoid unnecessary surgery on the one hand and delayed surgery on the other hand, as both may negatively affect pregnancy outcomes. Clinical scores for risk-stratified management of suspected appendicitis are well established in adults but have not been validated during pregnancy. This nested case-control study evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of the Appendicitis Inflammatory Response (AIR) score and imaging during pregnancy. By cross-linking national Swedish health registries from a defined geographical area, we identified a cohort of 154 women who underwent appendectomy for suspected appendicitis during pregnancy and a matched cohort of 232 pregnant women admitted for acute abdominal pain and suspected appendicitis but with a discharge diagnosis of nonspecific abdominal pain (NSAP). All variables were extracted from medical records. The diagnostic value of AIR score and imaging was estimated for patients with a final diagnosis of appendicitis compared with patients with negative appendectomy and NSAP patients. The final diagnoses for the operated patients were uncomplicated and complicated appendicitis in 49.4% and 26.6%, respectively, and negative appendectomy in 24.0%. Nearly half of all the patients underwent diagnostic imaging (41%), mainly by ultrasonography. The sensitivity and specificity of diagnostic imaging were 44.9% (95% CI 32.9%-57.4%) and 42.2% (95% CI 31.9%-53.1%), respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of AIR score was 0.88 (95% CI 0.84-0.92) for all appendicitis and 0.90 (95% CI 0.84-0.95) for complicated appendicitis. The sensitivity for complicated appendicitis was 100% at a score of ≥4. The specificity for all appendicitis was 97% at a score of ≥9. The results of this study suggest that the AIR score may be a suitable diagnostic tool for risk stratification of pregnant women with abdominal pain and suspected appendicitis but further validation among pregnant women is needed.","20240410","Academic emergency medicine : official journal of the Society for Academic Emergency Medicine","Department of Surgery, County Hospital Ryhov, Jönköping, Sweden."

This study will examine whether the combination of MRI T1 and T2 mapping offers greater advantages in the diagnosis of DCM. The study included 28 patients with DCM and 21 healthy controls. CMR evaluation included late gadolinium enhancement (LGE), T1 mapping, extracellular volume (ECV) fraction and T2 mapping. The DCM group was divided into LGE (+) and LGE (-) subgroups. The main modes of LGE are subendocardial, midwall, subepicardial, or transmural. T1 values, T2 values, and ECV in the 16 segments myocardial levels were measured by post-processing software. Student's t-tests or Mann-Whitney U test was used to compare between two groups, and one-way ANOVA or Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to compare between multiple groups, with p values corrected by Bonferroni. The difference was considered statistically significant at P < 0.05. ROC curve analysis was used to compare the area under the curve (AUC) of each index and its combined value, and the cut-off value, sensitivity and specificity were determined by Jordan's index. Mean native myocardial T1, ECV and T2 were significantly higher in the DCM group compared to controls (p ≤ 0.001, respectively). The best cut-off values for T1, T2 and ECV to discriminate DCM from controls were 1184 ms, 40.9 ms and 29.2%, respectively. The AUC of T1, ECV and T2 were 0.87, 0.89, and 0.83, respectively. The combined AUC of the three values was 0.96. Native T1 value and ECV overcome some of the limitations of LGE, and the T2 helps to understand the extent of myocardial damage. The combination of T1 and T2 mapping techniques can reveal fibrotic and oedematous changes in the early stages of DCM, providing a more comprehensive assessment of DCM and better guidance for individualised clinical management of patients. We suggest that the addition of T2 mapping to the routine CMR examination of patients with suspected DCM, and the combined assessment of T1mapping and T2 mapping can provide complementary information about the disease and improve the early diagnosis of DCM.","20240423","Radiography (London, England : 1995)","Department of Clinical Medicine, Jining Medical University, Jining 272000, Shandong, China."

We used a multistep in silico screening strategy to identify repurposed candidate drugs against selected therapeutic molecular targets in GBM with potential to concomitantly target GSCs. Common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified through analysis of multiple GBM and GSC datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). For identification of target genes, we selected the genes with most significant effect on overall patient survival. The relative mRNA and protein expression of the selected genes in TCGA control versus GBM samples was also validated and their cancer dependency scores were assessed. Drugs targeting these genes and their corresponding proteins were identified from LINCS database using Connectivity Map (CMap) portal and by in silico molecular docking against each individual target using FDA-approved drug library from the DrugBank database, respectively. The molecules thus obtained were further evaluated for their ability to cross blood brain barrier (BBB) and their likelihood of resulting in drug resistance by acting as p-glycoprotein (p-Gp) substrates.

However, the interpretation of ES/GS presents a substantial operational challenge in clinical settings. Test interpretation requires the review of hundreds of genetic variants, a task that has become increasingly challenging given the rising use of ES/GS. In response, we present Clinical Assessment of Variants by Likelihood Ratios (CAVaLRi), which employ a modified likelihood ratio (LR) framework to assign diagnostic probabilities to candidate germline disease genes. CAVaLRi models aspects of the clinical variant assessment process, taking into consideration the predicted impact of the variant, the proband and parental genotypes, and the proband's clinical characteristics. It also factors in computational phenotype noise and weighs the relative significance of genotype, phenotype, and variant segregation information. We trained and tested CAVaLRi on variant and phenotype data from an internal cohort of 655 clinical ES cases. For validation, CAVaLRi's performance was benchmarked against four leading gene prioritization algorithms (Exomiser's hiPHIVE and PhenIX prioritizers, LIRICAL, and XRare) using a distinct cohort of 12,832 ES cases. Our findings reveal that CAVaLRi significantly outperforms its counterparts when clinician-curated phenotype sets are used, as evidenced by its superior precision-recall curve (PR AUC: 0.701) and average diagnostic gene rank (1.59). Notably, even when substituting highly focused clinician-curated phenotype sets with large and potentially nonspecific computationally derived phenotypes, CAVaLRi retains its precision (PR AUC: 0.658; diagnostic gene average rank: 1.68) and markedly outperforms other tools. In a large, heterogeneous validation cohort, CAVaLRi stood out as the most precise prioritization algorithm (PR AUC: 0.335; average diagnostic rank: 1.91). In conclusion, CAVaLRi presents a robust solution for prioritizing diagnostic genes, surpassing current methods. It demonstrates resilience to noisy, computationally-derived phenotypes, providing a scalable strategy to help labs focus on the most diagnostically relevant variants, thus addressing the growing demand for ES/GS interpretation.","20240429","Human mutation","The Office of Data Sciences, The Abigail Wexner Research Institute, Nationwide Children's Hospital, Columbus, Ohio, USA."

All treatments provided 1 g of HMB. Blood samples were taken before and on multiple time points following ingestion. The following parameters were calculated: peak plasma (Cmax), time to peak (Tmax), slope of HMB appearance in blood, area under the curve (AUC), half-life time (t1/2) and relative bioavailability (HMB-Ca in water set as reference). All treatments led to rapid and large increases in plasma HMB. HMB-Ca in capsules and in water showed similar plasma HMB values across time (p = 0.438).

This exploratory study included serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples of patients with migraine during the headache phase (ictally) (n = 23), between attacks (interictally) (n = 16), and age/sex-matched controls (n = 19). Total Tau (t-Tau) protein, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (UCH-L1), and neurofilament light chain (NfL) were measured with the Neurology 4-plex kit on a Single Molecule Array SR-X Analyzer (Simoa® SR-X, Quanterix Corp., Lexington, MA). Markers of microglial activation, C-X3-C motif chemokine ligand 1 (CX3CL1) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 2 (sTREM2), were assessed using an immunoassay. Concentrations of CX3CL1 but not sTREM2 were significantly increased both ictally and interictally in CSF but not in serum in comparison to the control cohort (p = 0.039). ROC curve analysis provided an AUC of 0.699 (95% CI 0.563 to 0.813, p = 0.007). T-Tau in serum but not in CSF was significantly increased in samples from patients taken during the headache phase, but not interictally (effect size: η2 = 0.121, p = 0.038).

Patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis without or with organ dysfunction/failure, the so-called acute-on-chronic liver failure (ACLF), have a particularly high short-term mortality. Recognizing the specificity of this clinical situation, dedicated classifications and scores have been developed over the last 15 years, including variables (e.g. organ failures and systemic inflammation) not part of the formerly available cirrhosis severity scores, namely Child-Pugh score or MELD. For patients with acute decompensation of cirrhosis, it led to the development of a dedicated score, the Clif-C-AD score, independently validated. For more severe patients, three different scoring systems have been proposed, by European, Asian and North American societies namely Clif-C-ACLF, AARC score and NASCELD-ACLF respectively. These scores have been validated, and are widely used across the world. The differences and similarities between these scores, as well as their validation and limitations are discussed here. Even if these scores and classifications have been a step forward in favouring homogeneity between studies, and in helping making decisions for individual patients, their predictive value for mortality can still be improved as their area under the ROC curve does not exceed .8.

Patients with anterior circulation stroke, large vessel occlusion, and Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score (ASPECTS) ≤ 5 were included. VPCO was defined as modified Rankin scale (mRS) ≥ 5 at discharge. MLS and EV were quantified at admission and in follow-up CT 24 h after admission. Correlation was analyzed between MLS, EV, and total infarct volume (TIV). Multivariable logistic regression and receiver operating characteristics curve analyses were performed to compare MLS and EV as predictors of MI and VPCO. Seventy patients (median TIV 110 mL) were analyzed. EV showed strong correlation to TIV (r = 0.91, p < 0.001) and good diagnostic accuracy to classify MI (EV AUC 0.74 [95%CI 0.61-0.88] vs. MLS AUC 0.82 [95%CI 0.71-0.94]; p = 0.48) and VPCO (EV AUC 0.72 [95%CI 0.60-0.84] vs. MLS AUC 0.69 [95%CI 0.57-0.81]; p = 0.5) with no significant difference compared to MLS, which did not correlate with TIV < 110 mL (r = 0.17, p = 0.33). EV might serve as an imaging biomarker of ischemic edema in future studies, as it is applicable to infarcts of all volumes and predicts MI and VPCO in patients with large infarcts with the same accuracy as MLS. Utilization of edema volume instead of midline shift as an edema parameter would allow differentiation of patients with large and small infarcts based on the extent of edema, with possible advantages in the prediction of treatment effects, complications, and outcome. • CT densitometry-based absolute edema volume challenges midline shift as current gold standard measure of ischemic edema. • Edema volume predicts malignant infarction and poor clinical outcome in patients with large infarcts with similar accuracy compared to MLS irrespective of the lesion extent. • Edema volume might serve as a reliable quantitative imaging biomarker of ischemic edema in acute stroke triage independent of lesion size.","20240416","European radiology","Department of Neuroradiology, University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Martinistraße 52, 20251, Hamburg, Germany. v.geest@uke.de."

Many machine-learning (ML) models predict short-term hypoglycemia are not specific for older adults and show poor precision-recall. We aimed to develop a multidimensional, electronic health record (EHR)-based ML model to predict one-year risk of SH requiring hospitalization in older adults with diabetes. We adopted a case-control design for a retrospective territory-wide cohort of 1,456,618 records from 364,863 unique older adults (age ≥65 years) with diabetes and at least 1 Hong Kong Hospital Authority attendance from 2013 to 2018. We used 258 predictors including demographics, admissions, diagnoses, medications, and routine laboratory tests in a one-year period to predict SH events requiring hospitalization in the following 12 months. The cohort was randomly split into training, testing, and internal validation sets in a 7:2:1 ratio. Six ML algorithms were evaluated including logistic-regression, random forest, gradient boost machine, deep neural network (DNN), XGBoost, and Rulefit. We tested our model in a temporal validation cohort in the Hong Kong Diabetes Register with predictors defined in 2018 and outcome events defined in 2019. Predictive performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) statistics, and positive predictive value (PPV). We identified 11,128 SH events requiring hospitalization during the observation periods. The XGBoost model yielded the best performance (AUROC = 0.978 [95% CI 0.972 to 0.984]; AUPRC = 0.670 [95% CI 0.652 to 0.688]; PPV = 0.721 [95% CI 0.703 to 0.739]). This was superior to an 11-variable conventional logistic-regression model comprised of age, sex, history of SH, hypertension, blood glucose, kidney function measurements, and use of oral glucose-lowering drugs (GLDs) (AUROC = 0.906; AUPRC = 0.085; PPV = 0.468). Top impactful predictors included non-use of lipid-regulating drugs, in-patient admission, urgent emergency triage, insulin use, and history of SH. External validation in the HKDR cohort yielded AUROC of 0.856 [95% CI 0.838 to 0.873]. Main limitations of this study included limited transportability of the model and lack of geographically independent validation.

We aimed to do so by using Machine Learning. 275 PD patients were included. Four cognitive batteries were created: two Standard ones (Levels I and II), applying current criteria and ""traditional"" tests; two Alternative ones (Levels I and II), which incorporated a test of social cognition. These batteries were included in the Random Forest (RF) classifier. To assess RF performance, the AUC was considered, and the Variable Importance Index was estimated to understand the contribution of each test in PD-MCI classification. Standard Level I and II showed an AUC of 0.852 and 0.892, while Alternative Level I and II showed an AUC of 0.898 and of 0.906. Variable Importance Index revealed that TMT B-A, Ekman test, RAVLT-IR, MoCA, and Action Naming were tests that most contributed to PD-MCI classification.

Bilateral sEMG and 3D-kinematic data were collected from clinically non-lame horses (n = 8) during in-hand trot. iFL and iHL (2-3/5 AAEP) were induced on separate days using a modified horseshoe, with baseline data initially collected each day. sEMG signals were DC-offset removed, high-pass filtered (40 Hz), and full-wave rectified. Normalized, average rectified value (ARV) was calculated for each muscle and stride (sEMGabs), with the difference between right and left-side ARV representing sEMGasym. Asymmetry parameters (MinDiff, MaxDiff, Hip Hike) were calculated from poll, withers, and pelvis vertical displacement. Receiver-operating-characteristic (ROC) and area under the curve (AUC) analysis determined the accuracy of each parameter for distinguishing baseline from iFL or iHL.

The diagnosis of MCI was based on the aging-associated cognitive decline (AACD), and 13 factors (gender, education, marital status, residence, diabetes, hypertension, depression, hearing impairment, social isolation, physical activity, drinking status, body mass index and expenditure) were finally selected as predictors. We implemented a long short-term memory (LSTM) to predict the MCI risks in middle-aged and older adults within 7 years. The Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) and calibration curve were used to evaluate the performance of the model. Through 7 years of follow-up, 1925 participants developed MCI. The model for all incident MCI achieved an AUC of 0.774, and its deployment to the participants followed 2, 4, and 7 years achieved results of 0.739, 0.747, and 0.750, respectively. The model was well-calibrated with predicted probabilities plotted against the observed proportions of cognitive impairment. Education level, gender, marital status, and depression contributed most to the prediction of MCI. This model could be widely applied to medical institutions, even in the community, to identify middle-aged and older adults at high risk of MCI.","20240420","Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology","Department of Epidemiology, School of Public Health, Key Laboratory of Public Health Safety (Fudan University), Ministry of Education, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."

These saponins, which act as a defense against herbivores and pathogens also show promise in treating human conditions such as heart failure, pain, hypercholesterolemia, cancer, and inflammation. Some of these effects are mediated by activating AMP-dependent protein kinase (AMPK). Therefore, comprehensive screening for activating constituents in a CR extract is highly desirable. Employing machine learning (ML) techniques such as Deep Neural Networks (DNN), Logistic Regression Classification (LRC), and Random Forest Classification (RFC) with molecular fingerprint MACCS descriptors, 95 CR constituents were classified. Calibration involved 50 randomly chosen positive and negative controls. LRC achieved the highest overall test accuracy (90.2%), but DNN and RFC surpassed it in precision, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC AUC. All CR constituents were predicted as activators, except for three non-triterpene compounds. The validity of these classifications was supported by good calibration, with misclassifications ranging from 3% to 17% across the various models. High sensitivity (84.5-87.2%) and specificity (84.1-91.4%) suggest suitability for screening.

Four models (logistic regression, neural network, random forest, and XGBoost) were trained, validated, and a user-friendly risk calculator was then developed. A total of 1954 CRS-HIPEC procedures for peritoneal carcinomatosis were included. Overall, 13% (n = 258) achieved TO following CRS-HIPEC procedure.

Brain edema cases were radiologically identified using the following MR criteria: brain parenchymal T2 prolongation, blurring of lamination, and effacement of external CSF spaces. Fractional anisotropy (FA) values were calculated from regions of interest (ROI), including hemispheric parenchyma, internal capsule, and corticospinal tract, and compared group-wise. After 1:1 age matching and manual single-slice 2D segmentation of the fetal brain parenchyma using ITK-Snap, radiomics features were extracted using pyradiomics. Areas under the curve (AUCs) of the features regarding discriminating subgroups were calculated. Ninety-one fetuses with Chiari II underwent a total of 101 MRI scans at a median gestational age of 24.4 weeks and were included. Fifty scans were visually classified as Chiari II with brain edema group and showed significantly reduced external CSF spaces compared to the nonedema group (9.8 vs. 18.3 mm, p < 0.001). FA values of all used ROIs were elevated in the edema group (p < 0.001 for all ROIs). The 10 most important radiomics features showed an AUC of 0.81 (95%CI: 0.71, 0.91) for discriminating between Chiari II fetuses with and without edema. Brain edema in fetuses with Chiari II is common and radiologically detectable on T2-weighted fetal MRI sequences, and DTI-based FA values and radiomics features provide further evidence of microstructure differences between subgroups with and without edema. A more severe phenotype of fetuses with Chiari II malformation is characterized by prenatal brain edema and more postnatal clinical morbidity and disability. Fetal brain edema is a promising prenatal MR imaging biomarker candidate for optimizing the risk-benefit evaluation of selection for fetal surgery. Brain edema of fetuses prenatally diagnosed with Chiari II malformation is a common, so far unknown, association.

Therefore, with the improvement of computing power, predicting LPI has met new development opportunity. In virtue of the state-of-the-art works, a framework called LncRNA-Protein Interactions based on Kernel Combinations and Graph Convolutional Networks (LPI-KCGCN) has been proposed in this article. We first construct kernel matrices by taking advantage of extracting both the lncRNAs and protein concerning the sequence features, sequence similarity features, expression features, and gene ontology. Then reconstruct the existent kernel matrices as the input of the next step. Combined with known LPI interactions, the reconstructed similarity matrices, which can be used as features of the topology map of the LPI network, are exploited in extracting potential representations in the lncRNA and protein space using a two-layer Graph Convolutional Network. The predicted matrix can be finally obtained by training the network to produce scoring matrices w.r.t. lncRNAs and proteins.

However, its accuracy is limited. While progress is being made using medical imaging for PCa screening, PSA testing can still be improved as an easily accessible first step in the screening process. We aimed to develop and validate a new model by further personalizing the analysis of PSA with demographic, medical history, lifestyle parameters, and digital rectal examination (DRE) results. Using data from 34,224 patients in the screening arm of the PLCO trial (22,188 for the training set and 12,036 for the validation set), we applied a gradient-boosting model whose features (Model 1) were one PSA value and the personal variables available in the PLCO trial except those that signaled an ex-ante assumption of PCa. A second algorithm (Model 2) included a DRE result. The primary outcome was the occurrence of PCa, while the aggressiveness of PCa was a secondary outcome. ROC analyses were used to compare both models to other initial screening tests. The areas under the curve (AUC) for Model 2 was 0.894 overall and 0.908 for patients with a suspicious DRE, compared to 0.808 for PSA for patients with a suspicious DRE. The AUC for Model 1 was 0.814 compared to 0.821 for PSA. Model 2 predicted 58% more high-risk PCa than PSA ≥4 combined with an abnormal DRE and had a positive predictive value of 74.7% (vs. 50.6%). Personalizing the interpretation of PSA values and DRE results with a gradient-boosting model showed promising results as a potential novel, low-cost method for the initial screening of PCa. The importance of DRE, when included in such a model, was also highlighted.","20240404","The Prostate","Prostperia, Nancy, France."

The primary aim of this pilot study was to benchmark the ability of multiple biomarkers of aging (p16, epigenetic clocks, T cell gene expression profiles, and T cell receptor excision circles (TREC) to identify frailty as measured by a clinical impairment index (I2) in patients with HM. 70 patients newly diagnosed with HM had peripheral blood T lymphocytes (PBTL) analyzed for p16INK4a expression using the OSU_Senescence Nanostring CodeSet. PBTL epigenetic age was measured using 7 epigenetic clocks, and TREC were quantified by qRT-PCR. A composite clinical impairment index (I2) was generated by combining values from 11 geriatric metrics (Independent Activities of Daily Living (iADL), physical health score, Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB), Body Mass Index (BMI), Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, self-reported KPS, Blessed Orientation Memory Concentration (BOMC), polypharmacy, Mental Health Inventory (MHI)-17, Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) subscales). Clinical frailty was defined as a score of 7 or greater on the I2. Age-adjusted p16INK4a was similar in newly diagnosed patients and healthy controls (p > 0.1). PBTL p16INK4a levels correlated positively with the Hannum [r = 0.35, 95% CI (0.09-0.75); p adj. = 0.04] and PhenoAge [r = 0.37, 95% CI (0.11-0.59); p adj. = 0.04] epigenetic clocks. The discrimination ability of the I2 model was calculated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). After adjusting for chronologic age and disease group, baseline p16INK4a [AUC = 0.76, 95% CI (0.56-0.98); p = 0.01], Hannum [AUC = 0.70, 95% CI (0.54-0.85); p = 0.01], PhenoAge [AUC = 0.71, 95% CI (0.55-0.86); p = 0.01], and DunedinPACE [AUC = 0.73, 95% CI (0.57-0.88); p =  < 0.01] measures showed the greatest potential to identify clinical frailty using the I2. Our pilot data suggest that multiple blood-based aging biomarkers have potential to identify frailty in older adults with HM.

However, the associations of short-term peridiagnosis weight dynamics in standardized, clinically operational time frames with cancer survival remain largely unknown. This study aimed to screen for and evaluate the optimal indicator of short-term peridiagnosis weight dynamics to predict overall survival (OS) in patients with cancer. This multicentre cohort study prospectively collected data from 7460 patients pathologically diagnosed with cancer between 2013 and 2019. Body weight data were recorded 1 month before, at the time of and 1 month following diagnosis. By permuting different types (point value in kg, point height-adjusted value in kg/m2, absolute change in kg or relative change in percentage) and time frames (prediagnosis, postdiagnosis or peridiagnosis), we generated 12 different weight-related indicators and compared their prognostic performance using Harrell's C-index, integrated discrimination improvement, continuous net reclassification improvement and time-dependent C-index. We analysed associations of peridiagnosis relative weight change (RWC) with OS using restricted cubic spine (RCS), Kaplan-Meier analysis and multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models. The study enrolled 5012 males and 2448 females, with a median age of 59 years. During a median follow-up of 37 months, 1026 deaths occurred. Peridiagnosis (1 month before diagnosis to 1 month following diagnosis) RWC showed higher prognostic performance (Harrell's C-index = 0.601, 95% confidence interval [CI] = [0.583, 0.619]) than other types of indicators including body mass index (BMI), absolute weight change, absolute BMI change, prediagnosis RWC and postdiagnosis RWC in the study population (all P < 0.05). Time-dependent C-index analysis also indicated that peridiagnosis RWC was optimal for predicting OS. The multivariable-adjusted RCS analysis revealed an N-shaped non-linear association between peridiagnosis RWC and OS (PRWC < 0.001, Pnon-linear < 0.001). Univariate survival analysis showed that the peridiagnosis RWC groups could represent distinct mortality risk stratifications (P < 0.001). Multivariable survival analysis showed that, compared with the maintenance group (weight change < 5%), the significant (gain >10%, hazard ratio [HR] = 0.530, 95% CI = [0.413, 0.680]) and moderate (gain 5-10%, HR = 0.588, 95% CI = [0.422, 0.819]) weight gain groups were both associated with improved OS. In contrast, the moderate (loss 5-10%, HR = 1.219, 95% CI = [1.029, 1.443]) and significant (loss >10%, HR = 1.280, 95% CI = [1.095, 1.497]) weight loss groups were both associated with poorer OS. The prognostic performance of peridiagnosis RWC is superior to other weight-related indicators in patients with cancer. The findings underscore the importance of expanding the surveillance of body weight from at diagnosis to both past and future, and conducting it within clinically operational time frames, in order to identify and intervene with patients who are at risk of weight change-related premature deaths.","20240421","Journal of cachexia, sarcopenia and muscle","Department of Clinical Nutrition, Daping Hospital, Army Medical University (Third Military Medical University), Chongqing, China."

Subjects without radiographic signs of KOA according to the Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) classification scale (KL=0 in both knees) were enrolled in the OA initiative (OAI) cohort and the Prospective Cohort of A Coruña (PROCOAC). Prognostic models were developed to predict rKOA incidence during a 96-month follow-up period among OAI participants based on clinical variables and serum levels of the candidate protein biomarkers APOA1, APOA4, ZA2G and A2AP. The predictive capability of the biomarkers was assessed based on area under the curve (AUC), and internal validation was performed to correct for overfitting. A nomogram was plotted based on the regression parameters. Model performance was externally validated in the PROCOAC. 282 participants from the OAI were included in the development dataset. The model built with demographic, anthropometric and clinical data (age, sex, body mass index and WOMAC pain score) showed an AUC=0.702 for predicting rKOA incidence during the follow-up.

Predictive performance was externally validated in an independent dataset of 100 individuals from the PROCOAC (AUC=0.713). A novel prognostic model based on common clinical variables and protein biomarkers was developed and externally validated to predict rKOA incidence over a 96-month period in individuals without any radiographic signs of disease.

AF, HF, and death events were recorded. Associations between baseline sST2 concentrations and clinical outcomes were assessed using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) curves, and Cox regression and generalised additive models. Subgroup analysis were carried out between RI and non-RI groups. Among the patients with CHD (61.5 ± 11.8 years; 78.6 % men), 415 (12.02 %) had RI.

This provides a rapid, safe, and cost-effective imaging modality for screening lung diseases. However, the current pulmonary ultrasound diagnosis mainly relies on the subjective assessments of sonographers, which has high requirements for the operator's professional ability and clinical experience. In this study, we proposed an objective and quantifiable algorithm for the diagnosis of lung diseases that utilizes two-dimensional (2D) spectral features of ultrasound radiofrequency (RF) signals. The ultrasound data samples consisted of a set of RF signal frames, which were collected by professional sonographers. In each case, a region of interest of uniform size was delineated along the pleural line. The standard deviation curve of the 2D spatial spectrum was calculated and smoothed. A linear fit was applied to the high-frequency segment of the processed data curve, and the slope of the fitted line was defined as the frequency spectrum standard deviation slope (FSSDS). Based on the current data, the method exhibited a superior diagnostic sensitivity of 98% and an accuracy of 91% for the identification of lung diseases. The area under the curve obtained by the current method exceeded the results obtained that interpreted by professional sonographers, which indicated that the current method could provide strong support for the clinical ultrasound diagnosis of lung diseases.","20240408","Ultrasonics","Key Laboratory of Modern Acoustics (MOE), Department of Physics, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructure, Nanjing University, Nanjing 210093, China."

Here, we present an omics approach where DNA methylation profiles are integrated with gene expression and results from proteomic data in breast cancer patients to predict response to therapy and pinpoint response-related epigenetic events. Fresh-frozen tumor biopsies taken before, during, and after treatment from human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 negative non-metastatic patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy with or without bevacizumab were subjected to molecular profiling. Here, we report that DNA methylation at enhancer CpGs related to cell cycle regulation can predict response to chemotherapy and bevacizumab for the estrogen receptor positive subset of patients (AUC = 0.874), and we validated this observation in an independent patient cohort with a similar treatment regimen (AUC = 0.762). Combining the DNA methylation scores with the scores from a previously published protein signature resulted in a slight increase in the prediction performance (AUC = 0.784). We also show that tumors receiving the combination treatment underwent more extensive epigenetic alterations. Finally, we performed an integrative expression-methylation quantitative trait loci analysis on alterations in DNA methylation and gene expression levels, showing that the epigenetic alterations that occur during treatment are different between responders and non-responders and that these differences may be explained by the proliferation-epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition axis through the activity of grainyhead like transcription factor 2. Using tumor purity computed from copy number data, we developed a method for estimating cancer cell-specific methylation to confirm that the association to response reflects DNA methylation in cancer cells.

This value was associated with a sensitivity and specificity of 0.70 (95% CI, 0.54-0.83) and 0.40 (95% CI, 0.34-0.45), and positive and negative predictive values of 0.14 (95% CI, 0.09-0.19) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.85-0.95), respectively. Our data demonstrate an association between reduced UVF close to term, severely stunted fetal growth and adverse perinatal outcome in a cohort of low-risk pregnant women, with a moderate ability to rule out and a poor ability to rule in either outcome. Further studies are needed to establish whether the assessment of UVF can improve the identification of fetuses at risk of subclinical placental insufficiency and adverse perinatal outcome. © 2023 The Authors.

We investigated the discordance between TAPSE, FAC, FWLS, and RVEF in RV systolic function grading and associated outcomes. We analyzed two- and three-dimensional echocardiography data from 2 centers including 750 patients followed up for all-cause mortality. Right ventricular dysfunction was defined as RVEF <45%, with guideline-recommended thresholds (TAPSE <17 mm, FAC <35%, FWLS >-20%) considered. Among patients with normal RVEF, significant proportions exhibited impaired TAPSE (21%), FAC (33%), or FWLS (8%). Conversely, numerous patients with reduced RVEF had normal TAPSE (46%), FAC (26%), or FWLS (41%). Using receiver-operating characteristic analysis, FWLS exhibited the highest area under the curve of discrimination for RV dysfunction (RVEF <45%) with 59% sensitivity and 92% specificity. Over a median 3.7-year follow-up, 15% of patients died. Univariable Cox regression identified TAPSE, FAC, FWLS, and RVEF as significant mortality predictors. Combining impaired conventional parameters showed that outcomes are the worst if at least 2 parameters are impaired and gradually better if only one or none of them are impaired (log-rank P < .005). Guideline-recommended cutoff values of conventional echocardiographic parameters of RV systolic function are only modestly associated with RVEF-based assessment. Impaired values of FWLS showed the closest association with the RVEF cutoff. Our results emphasize a multiparametric approach in the assessment of RV function, especially if 3D echocardiography is not available.","20240417","Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography","Heart and Vascular Center, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary."

The random forest model achieved a 94% AUC ROC with 82.76% specificity and 100% sensitivity. Significant differences were found in IBM patients, including increased CD8+ T-bet+ cells, CD4+ T cells skewed towards a Th1 phenotype and altered γδ T cell repertoire with a reduced proportion of Vγ9+Vδ2+ cells. IBM patients formed three clusters: (i) activated and inflammatory CD8+ and CD4+ T-cell profile and the highest proportion of anti-cN1A-positive patients in cluster 1; (ii) limited inflammation in cluster 2; (iii) highly differentiated, pro-inflammatory T-cell profile in cluster 3. Additionally, no significant differences in patients' age and gender were detected between immunophenotype clusters; however, worsening trends were detected with several functional outcomes.

They offer a simple but sophisticated approach to decipher the chemically encoded ligand information, making them a valuable tool in drug design. Methods: Our research summarized the key studies for applying 3D pharmacophore models in virtual screening for 6,944 compounds of APJ receptor agonists. Recent advances in clustering algorithms and ensemble methods have enabled classical pharmacophore modeling to evolve into more flexible and knowledge-driven techniques. Butina clustering categorizes molecules based on their structural similarity (indicated by the Tanimoto coefficient) to create a structurally diverse training dataset. The learning method combines various individual pharmacophore models into a set of pharmacophore models for pharmacophore space optimization in virtual screening. Results: This approach was evaluated on Apelin datasets and afforded good screening performance, as proven by Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC score of 0.994 ± 0.007), enrichment factor of (EF1% of 50.07 ± 0.211), Güner-Henry score of 0.956 ± 0.015, and F-measure of 0.911 ± 0.031. Discussion: Although one of the high-scoring models achieved statistically superior results in each dataset (AUC of 0.82; an EF1% of 19.466; GH of 0.131 and F1-score of 0.071), the ensemble learning method including voting and stacking method balanced the shortcomings of each model and passed with close performance measures.","20240416","Frontiers in chemistry","Faculty of Pharmacy, University of Medicine and Pharmacy at Ho Chi Minh City, Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam."

Automated cell imaging provides many benefits such as their ability to provide high-content data, modularity, dynamics recording and the fact that imaging is the most direct way to access cell viability and cell proliferation. However, currently most publicly available large-scale anticancer drugs screens, such as GDSC, CTRP and NCI-60, provide cell viability data measured by assays based on colorimetric or luminometric measurements of NADH or ATP levels. Although such datasets provide valuable data, it is unclear how well drug toxicity measurements can be integrated with imaging data. Here we explored the relations between drug toxicity data obtained by XTT assay, two quantitative nuclei imaging methods and trypan blue dye exclusion assay using a set of four cancer cell lines with different morphologies and 30 drugs with different mechanisms of action. We show that imaging-based approaches provide high accuracy and the differences between results obtained by different methods highly depend on drug mechanism of action. Selecting AUC metrics over IC50 or comparing data where significantly drugs reduced cell numbers noticeably improves consistency between methods. Using automated cell segmentation protocols we analyzed mitochondria activity in more than 11 thousand drug-treated cells and showed that XTT assay produces unreliable data for CDK4/6, Aurora A, VEGFR and PARP inhibitors due induced cell size growth and increase in individual mitochondria activity. We also explored several benefits of image-based analysis such as ability to monitor cell number dynamics, dissect changes in total and individual mitochondria activity from cell proliferation, and ability to identify chromatin remodeling drugs. Finally, we provide a web tool that allows comparing results obtained by different methods.","20240418","Cell death discovery","Department of Cancer Cell Biology, Engelhardt Institute of Molecular Biology, Russian Academy of Sciences, 32 Vavilova str., Moscow, 119991, Russia."

However, there is a lack of research on non-invasive and rapid prediction of cardiovascular risk. We aimed to develop and validate a machine-learning model for predicting cardiovascular risk based on variables encompassing clinical questionnaires and oculomics. We collected data from the Korean National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (KNHANES). The training dataset (80% from the year 2008 to 2011 KNHANES) was used for machine learning model development, with internal validation using the remaining 20%. An external validation dataset from the year 2012 assessed the model's predictive capacity for TyG-index or AIP in new cases. We included 32122 participants in the final dataset. Machine learning models used 25 algorithms were trained on oculomics measurements and clinical questionnaires to predict the range of TyG-index and AIP. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score were used to evaluate the performance of our machine learning models. Based on large-scale cohort studies, we determined TyG-index cut-off points at 8.0, 8.75 (upper one-third values), 8.93 (upper one-fourth values), and AIP cut-offs at 0.318, 0.34. Values surpassing these thresholds indicated elevated cardiovascular risk.

GEP-NETs patients determined from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER)-13 registry database (1992-2018) and with additional treatment data from the SEER-18 registry database (1975-2016). In order to select independent prognostic factors that contribute significantly to patient survival and can be included in the nomogram, multivariate Cox regression analysis was performed using the minimum value of Akaike information criterion (AIC) and we analyzed the relationship of variables with OS by calculating hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs. In addition, we also comprehensively compared the nomogram using to predict OS with the current 7th American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) staging system. From 2004 to 2015, a total of 42 662 patients at diagnosis years with GEP-NETs were determined from the SEER database. The results indicated that the increasing incidence of GEP-NETs per year and the highest incidence is in patients aged 50-54. After removing cases lacking adequate clinicopathologic characteristics, the remaining eligible patients ( n =7564) were randomly divided into training (3782 patients) and testing sets (3782 patients). In the univariate analysis, sex, age, race, tumour location, SEER historic stage, pathology type, TNM, stage, surgery, radiation, chemotherapy, and CS tumour size were found to be significantly related to OS. Ultimately, the key factors for predicting OS were determined, involving sex, age, race, tumour location, SEER historic stage, M, N, grade, surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy. For internal validation, the C-index of the nomogram used to estimate OS in the training set was 0.816 (0.804-0.828). For external validation, the concordance index (C-index) of the nomogram used to predict OS was 0.822 (0.812-0.832). In the training and testing sets, our nomogram produced minimum AIC values and C-index of OS compared with AJCC stage. Decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that the nomogram was better than the AJCC staging system because more clinical net benefits were obtained within a wider threshold probability range. A nomogram combined treatment data may be better discrimination in predicting overall survival than AJCC staging system.

We selected 18,572 ICU patients' records from the MIMIC-IV database for this study. We applied five machine learning classifiers: Logistic regression (LR), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), AdaBoost (AB) and XGBoost (XGB). We computed both the sum dose and the average dose for the medication and included them in our model. The performance of the RF model demonstrates the highest level of accuracy compared to other models, as indicated by an Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) of 0.716 and an Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of 0.023. The calibration improved all five classifiers (LR, RF, SVC, AB, XGB) in terms of ECE. The most important two features for RF are the length of 1st admission and the patient's age when they visited the hospital. The most important medication features are Phytonadione and Metoprolol Succinate XL. Also, both the sum and the average dose for the medication features contributed to the prediction task. Our model showed the capability to predict the prolonged ICU LOS of the 2nd admission by utilizing the demographic, diagnosis, and medication information from the 1st admission.

To evaluate the influence of liver fibrosis and inflammation on M2BPGi-Qt levels, we assessed M2BPGi-Qt levels at each fibrosis and activity stage within different etiologies of CLD based on pathological findings. Subsequently, we evaluated if the accuracy of fibrosis staging based on M2BPGi-Qt could be improved by considering the influence of liver inflammation. In patients with viral hepatitis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and primary biliary cholangitis, the median M2BPGi-Qt levels increased liver fibrosis progression.

After repeating this process for a total of 50 outcome permutations, we averaged the resulting AUCs. Any increase over a null AUC of 0.5 can be attributed to overfitting. Applying this approach and varying sample size and the number of imaging features, we found that failing to control for overfitting could result in near-perfect prediction (AUC near 1.0). Cross-validation offered greater protection against overfitting than the other evaluation techniques, and for most classification algorithms a sample size of at least 200 was required to assess as few as 10 features with less than 0.05 AUC inflation attributable to overfitting.

Targeting lactate metabolism (LM) in tumor cells as a method to potentiate anti-tumor immune responses represents a promising therapeutic strategy. Public single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-seq) cohorts collected from patients who received immunotherapy were systematically gathered and scrutinized to delineate the association between LM and the immunotherapy response. A novel LM-related signature (LM.SIG) was formulated through an extensive examination of 40 pan-cancer scRNA-seq cohorts. Then, multiple machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to validate the capacity of LM.SIG for immunotherapy response prediction and survival prognostication based on 8 immunotherapy transcriptomic cohorts and 30 The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) pan-cancer datasets. Moreover, potential targets for immunotherapy were identified based on 17 CRISPR datasets and validated via in vivo and in vitro experiments. The assessment of LM was confirmed to possess a substantial relationship with immunotherapy resistance in 2 immunotherapy scRNA-seq cohorts. Based on large-scale pan-cancer data, there exists a notably adverse correlation between LM.SIG and anti-tumor immunity as well as imbalance infiltration of immune cells, whereas a positive association was observed between LM.SIG and pro-tumorigenic signaling. Utilizing this signature, the ML model predicted immunotherapy response and prognosis with an AUC of 0.73/0.80 in validation sets and 0.70/0.87 in testing sets respectively. Notably, LM.SIG exhibited superior predictive performance across various cancers compared to published signatures. Subsequently, CRISPR screening identified LDHA as a pan-cancer biomarker for estimating immunotherapy response and survival probability which was further validated using immunohistochemistry (IHC) and spatial transcriptomics (ST) datasets. Furthermore, experiments demonstrated that LDHA deficiency in pancreatic cancer elevated the CD8+ T cell antitumor immunity and improved macrophage antitumoral polarization, which in turn enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapy. We unveiled the tight correlation between LM and resistance to immunotherapy and further established the pan-cancer LM.SIG, holds the potential to emerge as a competitive instrument for the selection of patients suitable for immunotherapy.","20240425","Journal of experimental & clinical cancer research : CR","Department of General Surgery, Pancreatic Disease Center, Ruijin Hospital, Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine, Shanghai, 200025, China."

However, the PA pressure waveform might be influenced by the direct transmission of the intrathoracic pressure changes throughout the respiratory cycle caused by mechanical ventilation (MV), potentially impacting the reliability of PA pulse wave analysis (PAPWA). We assessed a new method that minimizes the direct effect of the MV on continuous PA pressure measurements and enhances the reliability of PAPWA in tracking beat-to-beat RVSV. Continuous PA pressure and flow were simultaneously measured for 2-3 min in 5 pigs using a high-fidelity micro-tip catheter and a transonic flow sensor around the PA trunk, both pre and post an experimental ARDS model. RVSV was estimated by PAPWA indexes such as pulse pressure (SVPP), systolic area (SVSystAUC) and standard deviation (SVSD) beat-to-beat from both corrected and non-corrected PA signals. The reference RVSV was derived from the PA flow signal (SVref). The reliability of PAPWA in tracking RVSV on a beat-to-beat basis was enhanced after accounting for the direct impact of intrathoracic pressure changes induced by MV throughout the respiratory cycle. This was evidenced by an increase in the correlation between SVref and RVSV estimated by PAPWA under healthy conditions: rho between SVref and non-corrected SVSD - 0.111 (0.342), corrected SVSD 0.876 (0.130), non-corrected SVSystAUC 0.543 (0.141) and corrected SVSystAUC 0.923 (0.050).

We consecutively enrolled 126 cataract patients (including 246 eyes) with no comorbidities that could decrease best corrected visual acuity (BCVA). Three index tests (USG, nonmydriatic UWF, and mydriatic IDO) were performed preoperatively to screen for retinal breaks. One week after cataract extraction, a dilated IDO examination was repeated for the definitive diagnosis of retinal break as the reference standard. The sensitivity, specificity, Youden index (YI), and predictive values of each index test were calculated according to postoperative ophthalmoscopic findings. A deep-learning nomogram was developed to quantify the risk of retinal break presence using patients' baseline data and findings reported from preoperative ophthalmic tests. Fifty-two eyes (21%) were excluded from appropriate preoperative UWF imaging because of massive lens opacity. The BCVA cutoff point with maximum YI indicating UWF applicability was 0.6 logMAR (YI = 0.3; area under curve [AUC] = 0.7). Among all 246 eyes, preoperative IDO, USG, and UWF showed fair interobserver agreement (all κ > 0.2). According to postoperative IDO findings, the index tests with the highest sensitivity and specificity were USG (100%) and preoperative IDO (99%), respectively. For cataractous eyes without vision-impairing comorbidities, a BCVA better than 0.6 logMAR (Snellen acuity, 20/80) allows for appropriate nonmydriatic standard UWF imaging. In a high-volume clinic equipped with skilled ophthalmic examiners, screening with USG followed by directed IDO allows the efficient identification of retinal breaks in cataractous eyes.","20240424","Eye (London, England)","Eye Institute and Department of Ophthalmology, Eye & ENT Hospital, Fudan University, Shanghai, China."

Due to the lateral curvature of lumbar spine of degenerative scoliosis, accurate measurement of VBQ score by conventional measurement methods that capture MRI signal intensity at L1-4 may be limited under certain conditions. To this end, a new simplified S1 VBQ score method has been proposed, which is comparable to the previous L1-4 VBQ score or S1 Hounsfield unit (HU) value, and has high accuracy and reliability. To evaluate the predictive value of MRI-based S1 VBQ score for pedicle screw loosening following surgery for adult degenerative scoliosis (ADS). Retrospective single-center cohort. We reviewed 92 patients who underwent posterior lumbar interbody fusion (PLIF) with pedicle screw fixation for ADS between January 2017 and January 2020. Association between S1 VBQ score and pedicle screw loosening following surgery for ADS. We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients who performed PLIF between January 2017 and January 2020. The clear zone around pedicle screws≥1 mm can be identified as screw loosening. The S1 VBQ score is calculated from the S1 central-based noncontrast T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The signal intensity (SI) of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was then measured using ROI placed at the L3 level to normalize the results. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for screw loosening. Then, constructed a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and determined the threshold (cut-off) of VBQ score with high sensitivity and specificity based on Youden Index. A total of 92 patients were included, including 34 males and 58 females. The mean age of the patients was 61.23±1.23 years old. At 1-year follow-up, the screw loosening rate was 56.5% (52/92). The age and levels of fixation were higher in the loosening group than in the nonloosening group (p=.036, p=.025). Patients in the loosening group had a greater VBQ score compared to patients in the nonloosening group (3.31±0.41 vs 3.01±0.28, p=.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that advanced age (OR, 1.090; 95% CI 1.005-1.183; p=.039) and higher VBQ score (OR, 5.778; 95% CI 2.889-16.177; p=.001) were independent risk factors for screw loosening. In addition, the ROC curve were created to assess the role of VBQ score as predictors of screw loosening with a diagnostic accuracy of 74.6% (95% CI 64.2%-85.1%).The most suitable threshold for the VBQ score as determined by the Youden Index was 3.175 (sensitivity: 76.0%, specificity: 83.3%).

Similar findings were seen for incident HCC. Increased LSM by VCTE was associated with an increased risk of progression to both cirrhosis with portal hypertension, and to HCC, and had a high discriminative ability across different aetiologies of chronic liver diseases.

The syCRP and seCRP levels and their changes were assessed preoperatively and in the first-stage and second-stage revisions. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the ROC curves (AUCs) were analyzed.

Furthermore, syCRP proved to be more reliable in predicting reimplantation success, exhibiting an AUC of 0.86 versus 0.63 for seCRP. In evaluating trends in CRP levels to determine reimplantation timing, changes in syCRP levels demonstrated superior diagnostic utility, exhibiting an AUC of 0.79 versus 0.63 for changes in seCRP levels.

A logistic regression model was built, and its accuracy was evaluated by the sensitivity, specificity, and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of the Receiver Operating Characteristic. Analysis showed strong correlation between (1) XpressO memory tasks scores and the MoCA Memory Index Score (p-values < 0.001), and between (2) XpressO sub-test scores and MoCA total score (p-values < 0.005). The AUC for predicting MoCA performance is 0.845. To classify individuals with normal and abnormal MoCA scores, two threshold values were introduced for the total XpressO scores: sensitivity of 91% at a cutoff of 72, specificity of 90% at a cutoff of 42, and an undetermined range in between. XpressO demonstrated high AUC, high sensitivity and specificity to predict cognitive performance compared to the digital MoCA. It may provide efficient cognitive prescreening by identifying individuals who would benefit from further clinical assessments, potentially reducing waiting times and high burden on healthcare clinics.","20240401","Journal of the American Geriatrics Society","McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada."

Unfortunately, owing to a variety of reasons, analyte concentrations for some of the time points may be missing. This study aimed to develop an algorithm to estimate the missing values at sampled time points in the analyte response curve to a mixed meal tolerance test (MMTT). We developed an algorithm to simulate the missing postprandial concentration values for an MMTT. The algorithm was developed to handle any number of missing values for 2 or less consecutive missing values. The algorithm was tested on MMTT response curve data for glucose and triglyceride measurements in data from 3 different studies with 2119 postprandial MMTT response curves. The algorithm was validated by removing concentration values that were not missing and replacing them with the algorithm simulated values. The AUC error between the actual curve and simulated curves were also calculated. A web-based application was developed to automatically simulate missing values for an uploaded MMTT data set. The algorithm was programmed in Python and the resulting web-based application and a video tutorial were provided. The validation indicated good agreement between actual and simulated values with error increasing for less frequently sampled time points. The study with the mean minimum error of glucose concentrations was 6.2 ± 2.1 mg/dL and study with the mean maximum error of glucose concentrations was 11.3 ± 4.7 mg/dL. Triglycerides had 16.1 ± 6.2 mg/dL mean error. The AUC error was small ranging between 0.01% and 0.28%.

We parameterized three distinct model structures describing virus-host interaction by fitting to published viral kinetics data of untreated COVID-19 patients. The models were used to test theoretical behaviors and map therapeutic design criteria of the different MoAs, identifying the most rapid and robust antiviral activity from neutralizing biologic and anti-replicative MoAs. We found good agreement between model predictions and clinical viral load reduction observed with anti-replicative nirmatrelvir/ritonavir (Paxlovid®) and neutralizing biologics bamlanivimab and casirivimab/imdevimab (REGEN-COV®), building confidence in the modeling framework to inform a dose selection.

Dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI) is a sensitive tool for assessing breast cancer by analyzing tumor blood flow, but it requires gadolinium-based contrast agents, which carry risks such as brain retention and astrocyte migration. Contrast-free MRI is thus preferable for patients with renal impairment or who are pregnant. This study aimed to investigate the feasibility of generating contrast-enhanced MR images from precontrast images and to evaluate the potential use of synthetic images in diagnosing breast cancer.Approach. This retrospective study included 322 women with invasive breast cancer who underwent preoperative DCE-MRI.

The quality of the synthesized images was evaluated using the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and structural similarity (SSIM). The diagnostic performance of the generated images was assessed using a convolutional neural network to predict Ki-67, luminal A and histological grade with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC).

We collected and analyzed hourly imaging data over a span of at least 38 hours from 400 sequences, encompassing 502 parasites. Our method was compared to human annotations to validate its efficacy. Performance metrics, including the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity, were evaluated on an independent test dataset. The outcomes revealed an AUC of 0.873, a sensitivity of 84.6%, and a specificity of 83.3%, underscoring the potential of our CNN-based framework to predict liver stage development of P. berghei. These findings not only demonstrate the feasibility of our methodology but also could potentially contribute to the broader understanding of parasite biology.","20240418","Computational and structural biotechnology journal","Artificial Intelligence in Medicine group, University of Bern, Switzerland."

This was a retrospective cohort study that included 197 singleton pregnancies without (n = 178) and with (n = 19) a history of PTD which were found to have a short cervix (≤ 25 mm) between 18 + 0 and 23 + 6 weeks' gestation with a follow-up transvaginal CL measurement taken at least 1 week after vaginal progesterone treatment started. Receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC)-curve analysis was performed and three CL shortening patterns were evaluated: (1) ≥ 10% reduction; (2) ≥ 20% reduction; and (3) ≥ 5 mm reduction relative to the first CL measurement. The predictive performance of each CL reduction cut-off and its association with PTD ≤ 34 weeks and PTD < 37 weeks were evaluated. Overall, the rate of PTD ≤ 34 weeks was 16.8% (33/197) and that of PTD < 37 weeks was 36.5% (72/197). The area under the ROC curve of cervical shortening expressed in % for predicting PTD ≤ 34 weeks and PTD < 37 weeks was 0.703 and 0.608, respectively. Cervical shortening was observed in 60/197 (30.5%) patients, with 49/60 (81.7%) women showing ≥ 10% reduction, 32/60 (53.3%) ≥ 20% reduction and 27/60 (45.0%) ≥ 5 mm reduction in CL. Sensitivity and specificity for PTD ≤ 34 weeks were, respectively, 48.5% and 79.9% for ≥ 10% reduction; 36.4% and 87.8% for ≥ 20% reduction; and 27.3% and 89.0% for ≥ 5 mm reduction in CL. For PTD < 37 weeks, sensitivity and specificity were, respectively, 36.1% and 81.6% for ≥ 10% reduction; 27.8% and 90.4% for ≥ 20% reduction; and 20.8% and 90.4% for ≥ 5 mm reduction in CL. The highest positive likelihood ratios for PTD ≤ 34 and < 37 weeks were for ≥ 20% CL reduction (2.98 (95% CI, 1.62-5.49) and 2.89 (95% CI, 1.52-5.57), respectively). Despite significant differences in sensitivity among the different cut-offs for cervical shortening, favoring the ≥ 10% reduction cut-off, a reduction of ≥ 20% in CL showed the strongest association with PTD ≤ 34 weeks (odds ratio (OR), 4.11 (95% CI, 1.75-9.62)) and < 37 weeks (OR, 3.62 (95% CI, 1.65-7.96)), as compared with a less pronounced reduction in CL. In women with a short cervix treated with vaginal progesterone, a reduction in CL on a subsequent ultrasound scan can predict PTD ≤ 34 and < 37 weeks. A ≥ 20% reduction in CL had the highest positive likelihood ratio and strongest association with PTD ≤ 34 and < 37 weeks compared with ≥ 10% or ≥ 5 mm reduction. © 2023 International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology.","20240415","Ultrasound in obstetrics & gynecology : the official journal of the International Society of Ultrasound in Obstetrics and Gynecology","Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences, McGovern Medical School, University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth), Houston, TX, USA."

This was a case-control study. In total, 2,036 patients who underwent FET at the Third Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University from October 2019 to September 2020 were included. The patients were divided into a clinical pregnancy group and a nonclinical pregnancy group according to pregnancy outcome. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to analyze the factors affecting the clinical pregnancy rate. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal mean PI cutoff value of 1.75. After 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM), 562 patients were included. For statistical description and analysis, the patients were divided into two groups: a group with a mean PI > 1.75 and a group with a mean PI ≤ 1.75. The clinical pregnancy group included 1,218 cycles, and the nonclinical pregnancy group included 818 cycles. There were significant differences in female age (P<0.01), infertility type (P=0.04), baseline follicle-stimulating hormone level (P=0.04), anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) level (P<0.01), antral follicle count (P<0.01), number of transferred embryos (P=0.045) and type of transferred embryo (P<0.01).

Currently, diagnosis is based only on clinical symptoms; identifying objective biomarkers and a more reliable diagnostic procedure is desirable. We investigated whether people with panic disorder can be reliably diagnosed utilizing combinations of multiple polygenic scores for psychiatric disorders and their intermediate phenotypes, compared with single polygenic score approaches, by applying specific machine learning techniques. Polygenic scores for 48 psychiatric disorders and intermediate phenotypes based on large-scale genome-wide association studies (n = 7556-1,131,881) were calculated for people with panic disorder (n = 718) and healthy controls (n = 1717). Discrimination between people with panic disorder and healthy controls was based on the 48 polygenic scores using five methods for classification: logistic regression, neural networks, quadratic discriminant analysis, random forests and a support vector machine. Differences in discrimination accuracy (area under the curve) due to an increased number of polygenic score combinations and differences in the accuracy across five classifiers were investigated. All five classifiers performed relatively well for distinguishing people with panic disorder from healthy controls by increasing the number of polygenic scores. Of the 48 polygenic scores, the polygenic score for anxiety UK Biobank was the most useful for discrimination by the classifiers. In combinations of two or three polygenic scores, the polygenic score for anxiety UK Biobank was included as one of polygenic scores in all classifiers. When all 48 polygenic scores were used in combination, the greatest areas under the curve significantly differed among the five classifiers. Support vector machine and logistic regression had higher accuracy than quadratic discriminant analysis and random forests. For each classifier, the greatest area under the curve was 0.600 ± 0.030 for logistic regression (polygenic score combinations N = 14), 0.591 ± 0.039 for neural networks (N = 9), 0.603 ± 0.033 for quadratic discriminant analysis (N = 10), 0.572 ± 0.039 for random forests (N = 25) and 0.617 ± 0.041 for support vector machine (N = 11). The greatest areas under the curve at the best polygenic score combination significantly differed among the five classifiers. Random forests had the lowest accuracy among classifiers. Support vector machine had higher accuracy than neural networks. These findings suggest that increasing the number of polygenic score combinations up to approximately 10 effectively improved the discrimination accuracy and that support vector machine exhibited greater accuracy among classifiers.

Traditional pregnancy risk management systems have poor prediction abilities for adverse pregnancy outcomes in such patients, with many limitations in clinical application. In this study, we will use machine learning to screen high-risk factors for miscarriage and develop a miscarriage risk prediction model for patients with immune-abnormal pregnancies. This model aims to provide an adjunctive tool for the clinical identification of patients at high risk of miscarriage and to allow for active intervention to reduce adverse pregnancy outcomes. Methods: Patients with immune-abnormal pregnancies attending Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital were collected through electronic medical records (EMR). The data were divided into a training set and a test set in an 8:2 ratio. Comparisons were made to evaluate the performance of traditional pregnancy risk assessment tools for clinical applications. This analysis involved assessing the cost-benefit of clinical treatment, evaluating the model's performance, and determining its economic value. Data sampling methods, feature screening, and machine learning algorithms were utilized to develop predictive models. These models were internally validated using 10-fold cross-validation for the training set and externally validated using bootstrapping for the test set. Model performance was assessed by the area under the characteristic curve (AUC). Based on the best parameters, a predictive model for miscarriage risk was developed, and the SHapley additive expansion (SHAP) method was used to assess the best model feature contribution. Results: A total of 565 patients were included in this study on machine learning-based models for predicting the risk of miscarriage in patients with immune-abnormal pregnancies. Twenty-eight risk warning models were developed, and the predictive model constructed using XGBoost demonstrated the best performance with an AUC of 0.9209. The SHAP analysis of the best model highlighted the total number of medications, as well as the use of aspirin and low molecular weight heparin, as significant influencing factors. The implementation of the pregnancy risk scoring rules resulted in accuracy, precision, and F1 scores of 0.3009, 0.1663, and 0.2852, respectively. The economic evaluation showed a saving of ¥7,485,865.7 due to the model. Conclusion: The predictive model developed in this study performed well in estimating the risk of miscarriage in patients with immune-abnormal pregnancies. The findings of the model interpretation identified the total number of medications and the use of other medications during pregnancy as key factors in the early warning model for miscarriage risk. This provides an important basis for early risk assessment and intervention in immune-abnormal pregnancies. The predictive model developed in this study demonstrated better risk prediction performance than the Pregnancy Risk Management System (PRMS) and also demonstrated economic value. Therefore, miscarriage risk prediction in patients with immune-abnormal pregnancies may be the most cost-effective management method.","20240422","Frontiers in pharmacology","Department of Pharmacy, Personalised Drug Therapy Key Laboratory of Sichuan Province, Sichuan Academy of Medical Sciences and Sichuan Provincial People's Hospital, School of Medicine, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China."

In the present study, we reviewed thirty-three patients (mean age 64.9 ± 10 years; 31 males) with advanced CLI after failed or impossible revascularisation, who were treated with 40 mL of autologous BMCs by local intramuscular application. Patients with limb salvage and wound healing (N = 22) were considered as responders to BMCs therapy, and patients with limb salvage and complete ischemic wound healing (N = 13) were defined as super-responders. Logistic regression models were used to screen and identify the prognostic factors, and a receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve, a linear regression, and a survival curve were drawn to determine the predictive accuracy, the correlation between the candidate predictors, and the risk of major amputation. Based on the univariate regression analysis, baseline C-reactive protein (CRP) and transcutaneous oxygen pressure (TcPO2) values were identified as prognostic factors of the responders, while CRP value, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and bone marrow-derived mononuclear cells (BM-MNCs) concentration were identified as prognostic factors of the super-responders. An area under the ROC curve of 0.768 indicated good discrimination for CRP > 8.1 mg/L before transplantation as a predictive factor for negative clinical response. Linear regression analysis revealed a significant dependence between the levels of baseline CRP and the concentration of BM-MNCs in transplanted bone marrow. Patients taking atorvastatin before BMCs treatment (N = 22) had significantly improved TcPO2 and reduced pain scale after BMCs transplant, compared to the non-atorvastatin group. Statin treatment was associated with reduced risk for major amputation. However, the difference was not statistically significant. Statin use was also associated with a significantly higher concentration of BM-MNCs in the transplanted bone marrow compared to patients without statin treatment. Patients treated with RAS-acting agents (N = 20) had significantly reduced pain scale after BMCs transplant, compared to the non-RAS-acting agents group. Similar results, reduced pain scale and improved TcPO2, were achieved in patients treated with atorvastatin and RAS-acting agents (N = 17) before BMCs treatment. Results of the Spearman correlation showed a significant positive correlation between CLI regression, responders, and previous therapy before BMCs transplant with RAS-acting agents alone or with atorvastatin. CRP and TcPO2 were prognostic factors of the responders, while CRP value, ABI, and BM-MNCs concentration were identified as predictive factors of the super-responders. Atorvastatin treatment was associated with a significantly increased concentration of BM-MNCs in bone marrow concentrate and higher TcPO2 and lower pain scale after BMCs treatment in CLI patients. Similarly, reduced pain scales and improved TcPO2 were achieved in patients treated with atorvastatin and RAS-acting agents before BMCs treatment.

The gut microbiota plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD, yet the detailed characteristics and ecological alterations of gut microbial communities during the progression from non-alcoholic fatty liver (NAFL) to NASH remain poorly understood. Methods: In this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of gut microbiota composition in individuals with NAFL and NASH to elucidate differences and characteristics. We utilized 16S rRNA sequencing to compare the intestinal gut microbiota among a healthy control group (65 cases), NAFL group (64 cases), and NASH group (53 cases). Random forest machine learning and database validation methods were employed to analyze the data. Results: Our findings indicate a significant decrease in the diversity of intestinal flora during the progression of NAFLD (p < 0.05). At the phylum level, high abundances of Bacteroidetes and Fusobacteria were observed in both NAFL and NASH patients, whereas Firmicutes were less abundant. At the genus level, a significant decrease in Prevotella expression was seen in the NAFL group (AUC 0.738), whereas an increase in the combination of Megamonas and Fusobacterium was noted in the NASH group (AUC 0.769). Furthermore, KEGG pathway analysis highlighted significant disturbances in various types of glucose metabolism pathways in the NASH group compared to the NAFL group, as well as notably compromised flavonoid and flavonol biosynthesis functions. The study uncovers distinct microbiota characteristics and microecological changes within the gut during the transition from NAFL to NASH, providing insights that could facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers and therapeutic targets for NAFLD.","20240404","Frontiers in microbiology","Faculty of Chinese Medicine and State Key Laboratory of Quality Research in Chinese Medicine, Macau University of Science and Technology, Macau, China."

Thus, the present study aimed to identify morphologic femoral and acetabular risk factors that may also contribute to posterior hip dislocations in high-energy trauma mechanisms. The acetabular and femoral morphology of 83 hips with a traumatic posterior dislocation following a high-energy trauma mechanism were analyzed and matched to a control group of 83 patients who sustained high-energy trauma without a hip injury. The lateral center-edge angle, acetabular index, acetabular depth/width ratio, cranial and central acetabular version angles, and the anterior and posterior acetabular sector angles were measured on computed tomography to quantify femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) morphology, acetabular version, and coverage. The caput-collum-diaphyseal angle and the alpha angles in the coronal and axial planes were measured to detect cam-type FAI deformity. A receiver operating characteristic curve was utilized to determine threshold values for an increased risk of hip dislocation. Acetabular retroversion and posterior acetabular undercoverage were significantly increased in patients with hip dislocations compared with controls (p < 0.001). The central acetabular version angle and posterior acetabular sector angle that indicated an increased risk of hip dislocation were ≤9° and ≤90°, respectively. Cam-type FAI deformity and coxa valga were significantly increased in the dislocation group (p < 0.001). The anterolateral alpha angle that indicated an increased dislocation risk was ≥47°. Acetabular retroversion, posterior acetabular undercoverage, and cam-type FAI morphology may be risk factors contributing to traumatic posterior hip dislocation in high-energy trauma mechanisms.

Presently, a comprehensive clinical index to predict mortality in MVD remains elusive. The aim of our study is to construct and assess a nomogram for predicting the 28-day mortality risk of MVD patients. Patients diagnosed with MVD were identified via ICD-9 code from the MIMIC-III database. Independent risk factors were identified utilizing the LASSO method and multivariate logistic regression to construct a nomogram model aimed at predicting the 28-day mortality risk. The nomogram's performance was assessed through various metrics including the area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow test, integrated discriminant improvement (IDI), net reclassification improvement (NRI), and decision curve analysis (DCA). The study encompassed a total of 2771 patients diagnosed with MVD. Logistic regression analysis identified several independent risk factors: age, anion gap, creatinine, glucose, blood urea nitrogen level (BUN), urine output, systolic blood pressure (SBP), respiratory rate, saturation of peripheral oxygen (SpO2), Glasgow Coma Scale score (GCS), and metastatic cancer. These factors were found to independently influence the 28-day mortality risk among patients with MVD. The calibration curve demonstrated adequate calibration of the nomogram. Furthermore, the nomogram exhibited favorable discrimination in both the training and validation cohorts. The calculations of IDI, NRI, and DCA analyses demonstrate that the nomogram model provides a greater net benefit compared to the Simplified Acute Physiology Score II (SAPSII), Acute Physiology Score III (APSIII), and Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scoring systems. This study successfully identified independent risk factors for 28-day mortality in patients with MVD. Additionally, a nomogram model was developed to predict mortality, offering potential assistance in enhancing the prognosis for MVD patients.

This study was performed to investigate the effect of age at the index GR surgery on the complication rates and formulate clinical guidelines for the optimal timing to begin GR treatment for EOS patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to determine complication occurrence as a function of the age at the index surgery and to determine the survival rates for the procedures. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine optimal cut-off values for the optimal timing of index surgery based on whether complications occurred or not. 54 patients who met the criteria were enrolled in this study. The following spinal parameters were measured: major coronal Cobb angle, global kyphosis (GK), and coronal balance (CB). CB was defined as the horizontal distance from the C7 plumb line to the center sacral vertical line. All patients had completed GR treatment and had a minimum 1-year follow-up duration after the final surgical intervention. Patient data were collected as follows: age at the index surgery, gender, diagnosis, type of GR construct, and the number of lengthening procedures. The standing full-spine radiographs were obtained before and after the index surgery, before and after each lengthening procedure, before and after the final surgical intervention, and at the latest follow-up. Complications were categorized as implant, alignment, and general. Kaplan-Meier analysis of complications demonstrated a declining trend in complication rates with increasing age at the index surgery. The absence of perioperative complications was targeted, we constructed the ROC curve and the cut-off value was 71.0 months. Age at the index surgery was therefore categorized into two groups: younger-age group (≤ 71.0 months) and advanced-age group (> 71.0 months). There was a higher complication rate for the younger-age group than versus the advanced-age group (61.5% vs 22.0%, p=.011). PJK as a major alignment-related complication, was more frequent in the younger-age group than in the advanced-age group (30.8% vs 4.9%, p=.025). But the advanced-age group exhibited significantly more severe deformities before GR surgery compared to the younger-age group. This study shows that the elevated risk of complications observed in the younger-age group, which can be attributed to the younger age at the index surgery and the increased number of lengthening procedures during treatment.

Similar to HPV-positive, HPV-negative cervical carcinomas were frequently hypermethylated for these markers. This 5-marker panel detected SCC and HSIL in cervical smears with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Molecular tests with the ability to rapidly detect high-risk HSIL will lead to timely treatment for those in need and prevent unnecessary procedures in women with low-risk lesions throughout the world. Validation of these markers in prospectively collected cervical smear cells followed by the development of a hypermethylated marker-based cervical cancer detection test is warranted.","20240420","Clinical epigenetics","Women's Malignancies Program, Department of Oncology, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins, 1650 Orleans Street, Rm 144, CRB1, Baltimore, MD, 21231, USA."

Hepatic impairment studies have relied on clinical or laboratory criteria like Child-Pugh classification to categorize the degree of hepatic dysfunction. We compared HepQuant tests with Child-Pugh classification in predicting the pharmacokinetics of ampreloxetine. Twenty-one subjects with hepatic impairment (8 Child-Pugh A, 7 Child-Pugh B, and 6 Child-Pugh C), and 10 age- and sex-matched controls were studied. The pharmacokinetics of ampreloxetine were measured after oral administration of a single dose of 10 mg. Disease severity index (DSI), portal-systemic shunting (SHUNT%), hepatic reserve, and hepatic filtration rates (HFRs) were measured from serum samples obtained after intravenous administration of [24-13C]-cholate and oral administration of [2,2,4,4-2H]cholate. Ampreloxetine plasma exposure (AUC0-inf) was similar to controls in Child-Pugh A, increased 1.7-fold in subjects with Child-Pugh B, and 2.5-fold in subjects with Child-Pugh C and correlated with both Child-Pugh score and HepQuant parameters. The variability observed in ampreloxetine exposure (AUC0-inf) in subjects with moderate (Child-Pugh B) and severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh C) was explained by HepQuant parameters. Multivariable regression models demonstrated that DSI, SHUNT%, and Hepatic Reserve from SHUNT and DuO were superior predictors of ampreloxetine exposure (AUC0-inf) compared to Child-Pugh score. HepQuant DSI, SHUNT%, and hepatic reserve were more useful predictors of drug exposure than Child-Pugh class for ampreloxetine and thus may better optimize dose recommendations in patients with liver disease.

To address this challenge, a scaled average BE based on the reference product within-subject variability for narrowing the acceptance range of NTI drugs was recently proposed. However, this approach showed increased type I error (T1E), especially close to the cut-off point between the unscaled and scaled portions of the method. Based on simulations, this limitation can be overcome by predefining the protocol the path to be followed: either the fixed 90.00-111.11% acceptance range approach or the previously proposed scaled average BE approach with a slight adjustment of the one-sided significance level α to 0.042 for a 2 × 3 × 3 partial replicate design and without a lower cut-off point.

Two cross-sectional case-control designs examined the clinical utility of social network indicators for identifying individuals with AUD (cases) versus demographically matched drinkers without AUD (controls).

The study employed two distinct methods. MDC was calculated using distribution-based approaches to consider standard error of measurement and effect size change in a population of 321 patients (176 SMA II and 145 SMA III), allowing for stratification based on age and function. MCID was assessed using anchor-based methods (receiver operating characteristic [ROC] curve analysis and standard error) on 76 patients (52 SMA II and 24 SMA III) for whom the 12-month HFMSE could be anchored to a caregiver-reported clinical perception questionnaire. With both approaches, SMA type II and type III patients had different profiles. The MCID, using ROC analysis, identified optimal cutoff points of -2 for type II and -4 for type III patients, whereas using the standard error we found the optimal cutoff points to be 1.5 for improvement and -3.2 for deterioration. Furthermore, distribution-based methods uncovered varying values across age and functional status subgroups within each SMA type.

However, these methods have limitations, potentially resulting in imprecise predictions owing to incomplete coverage of AMR mechanisms and genetic variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose a pan-genome-based machine learning approach to advance our understanding of AMR gene repertoires and uncover possible feature sets for precise AMR classification. By building compacted de Brujin graphs (cDBGs) from thousands of genomes and collecting the presence/absence patterns of unique sequences (unitigs) for Pseudomonas aeruginosa, we determined that using machine learning models on unitig-centered pan-genomes showed significant promise for accurately predicting the antibiotic resistance or susceptibility of microbial strains. Applying a feature-selection-based machine learning algorithm led to satisfactory predictive performance for the training dataset (with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of > 0.929) and an independent validation dataset (AUC, approximately 0.77). Furthermore, the selected unitigs revealed previously unidentified resistance genes, allowing for the expansion of the resistance gene repertoire to those that have not previously been described in the literature on antibiotic resistance. These results demonstrate that our proposed unitig-based pan-genome feature set was effective in constructing machine learning predictors that could accurately identify AMR pathogens. Gene sets extracted using this approach may offer valuable insights into expanding known AMR genes and forming new hypotheses to uncover the underlying mechanisms of bacterial AMR.","20240416","Computational and structural biotechnology journal","Graduate Institute of Biomedical Informatics, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan."

IVIM images were acquired for 13 head-and-neck patients prior to radiotherapy. Post-radiotherapy scans were also acquired for five of these patients. Images were denoised prior to parameter fitting using neural blind deconvolution, a method of solving the ill-posed mathematical problem of blind deconvolution using neural networks. The signal decay curve was then quantified in terms of several area under the curve (AUC) parameters. Improvements in image quality were assessed using blind image quality metrics, total variation (TV), and the correlations between parameter changes in parotid glands with radiotherapy dose levels. The validity of blur kernel predictions was assessed by the testing the method's ability to recover artificial 'pseudokernels'. AUC parameters were compared with monoexponential, biexponential, and triexponential model parameters in terms of their correlations with dose, contrast-to-noise (CNR) around parotid glands, and relative importance via principal component analysis.Main results.

However, it is unclear how these anomalies affect the biomechanical stability of the craniovertebral junction (CVJ) and whether they are associated with an increased incidence of occipitocervical fusion (OCF) following posterior fossa decompression (PFD). The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of condylar hypoplasia and atlas anomalies in children with CM-I and syringomyelia. The authors also investigated the predictive contribution of these anomalies to the occurrence of OCF following PFD (PFD+OCF). The authors analyzed the prevalence of condylar hypoplasia and atlas arch anomalies for patients in the Park-Reeves Syringomyelia Research Consortium database who underwent PFD+OCF. Condylar hypoplasia was defined by an atlanto-occipital joint axis angle (AOJAA) ≥ 130°. Atlas assimilation and arch anomalies were identified on presurgical radiographic imaging. This PFD+OCF cohort was compared with a control cohort of patients who underwent PFD alone. The control group was matched to the PFD+OCF cohort according to age, sex, and duration of symptoms at a 2:1 ratio. Clinical features and radiographic atlanto-occipital joint parameters were compared between 19 patients in the PFD+OCF cohort and 38 patients in the PFD-only cohort. Demographic data were not significantly different between cohorts (p > 0.05). The mean AOJAA was significantly higher in the PFD+OCF group than in the PFD group (144° ± 12° vs 127° ± 6°, p < 0.0001). In the PFD+OCF group, atlas assimilation and atlas arch anomalies were identified in 10 (53%) and 5 (26%) patients, respectively. These anomalies were absent (n = 0) in the PFD group (p < 0.001). Multivariate regression analysis identified the following 3 CVJ radiographic variables that were predictive of OCF occurrence after PFD: AOJAA ≥ 130° (p = 0.01), clivoaxial angle < 125° (p = 0.02), and occipital condyle-C2 sagittal vertical alignment (C-C2SVA) ≥ 5 mm (p = 0.01). A predictive model based on these 3 factors accurately predicted OCF following PFD (C-statistic 0.95). The authors' results indicate that the occipital condyle-atlas joint complex might affect the biomechanical integrity of the CVJ in children with CM-I and syringomyelia. They describe the role of the AOJAA metric as an independent predictive factor for occurrence of OCF following PFD. Preoperative identification of these skeletal abnormalities may be used to guide surgical planning and treatment of patients with complex CM-I and coexistent osseous pathology.","20240405","Journal of neurosurgery.

Perinatal adaptations in the HPA-axis dynamics in terms of the Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR), may be involved in dysregulation of perinatal mental health. We aimed to determine if CAR and absolute evening cortisol early postpartum differed from non-perinatal women and evaluate the association between the CAR and maternal mental well-being. The CAR was computed as the area under the curve with respect to increase from baseline from serial home-sampling of saliva across 0-60 minutes from awakening. We evaluated differences in CAR and absolute evening cortisol between postpartum women (N=50, mean postpartum days: 38, SD: ±11) and non-perinatal women (N=91) in a multiple linear regression model. We also evaluated the association between CAR and maternal mental well-being in a multiple linear regression model. We found that healthy postpartum women had a blunted CAR (p<0.001) corresponding to 84% reduction and 80% lower absolute evening cortisol (p<0.001) relative to non-perinatal healthy women. In the postpartum group, there was a trend-level association between lower CAR and higher scores on the WHO Well-Being Index (WHO-5) (p=0.048) and lower Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) scores (p=0.04). Our data emphasize the unique hormonal landscape during the postpartum period in terms of blunted CAR and lower absolute evening cortisol in healthy women early postpartum compared to non-perinatal.

This paper aimed to quantify LVEF automatically and accurately with the proposed pipeline method based on deep neural networks and ensemble learning. Within the pipeline, an Atrous Convolutional Neural Network (ACNN) was first trained to segment the left ventricle (LV), before employing the area-length formulation based on the ellipsoid single-plane model to calculate LVEF values. This formulation required inputs of LV area, derived from segmentation using an improved Jeffrey's method, as well as LV length, derived from a novel ensemble learning model. To further improve the pipeline's accuracy, an automated peak detection algorithm was used to identify end-diastolic and end-systolic frames, avoiding issues with human error. Subsequently, single-beat LVEF values were averaged across all cardiac cycles to obtain the final LVEF. This method was developed and internally validated in an open-source dataset containing 10,030 echocardiograms. The Pearson's correlation coefficient was 0.83 for LVEF prediction compared to expert human analysis (p < 0.001), with a subsequent area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.97 to 0.99) for categorisation of HF with reduced ejection (HFrEF; LVEF<40%). In an external dataset with 200 echocardiograms, this method achieved an AUC of 0.90 (95% confidence interval 0.88 to 0.91) for HFrEF assessment.

Datasets comprise 24 931 IED (from 484 patients) and 166 094 non-IED 4-second video-EEG segments. The video data is processed by the proposed patient detection method, with frame difference and Simple Keypoints (SKPS) capturing patients' movements. EEG data is processed with EfficientNetV2. The video and EEG features are fused via a multilayer perceptron. We developed a comparative model, termed nEpiNet, to test the effectiveness of the video feature in vEpiNet. The 10-fold cross-validation was used for testing. The 10-fold cross-validation showed high areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) in both models, with a slightly superior AUROC (0.9902) in vEpiNet compared to nEpiNet (0.9878). Moreover, to test the model performance in real-world scenarios, we set a prospective test dataset, containing 215 h of raw video-EEG data from 50 patients. The result shows that the vEpiNet achieves an area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) of 0.8623, surpassing nEpiNet's 0.8316. Incorporating video data raises precision from 70% (95% CI, 69.8%-70.2%) to 76.6% (95% CI, 74.9%-78.2%) at 80% sensitivity and reduces false positives by nearly a third, with vEpiNet processing one-hour video-EEG data in 5.7 min on average. Our findings indicate that video data can significantly improve the performance and precision of IED detection, especially in prospective real clinic testing. It suggests that vEpiNet is a clinically viable and effective tool for IED analysis in real-world applications.","20240414","Neural networks : the official journal of the International Neural Network Society","Department of Neurology, Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing, 100730, China."

To date, the diagnosis is made by a pathologist on the excised tumor. The aim of this study was to develop a machine learning algorithm using radiomic data extracted from contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT) images that could accurately distinguish leiomyosarcomas from leiomyomas. Pre-operative CECT images from patients submitted to surgery with a histological diagnosis of leiomyoma or leiomyosarcoma were used for the region of interest identification and radiomic feature extraction. Feature extraction was conducted using the PyRadiomics library, and three feature selection methods combined with the general linear model (GLM), random forest (RF), and support vector machine (SVM) classifiers were built, trained, and tested for the binary classification task (malignant vs. benign). In parallel, radiologists assessed the diagnosis with or without clinical data. A total of 30 patients with leiomyosarcoma (mean age 59 years) and 35 patients with leiomyoma (mean age 48 years) were included in the study, comprising 30 and 51 lesions, respectively. Out of nine machine learning models, the three feature selection methods combined with the GLM and RF classifiers showed good performances, with predicted area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity ranging from 0.78 to 0.97, from 0.78 to 1.00, and from 0.67 to 0.93, respectively, when compared to the results obtained from experienced radiologists when blinded to the clinical profile (AUC = 0.73 95%CI = 0.62-0.84), as well as when the clinical data were consulted (AUC = 0.75 95%CI = 0.65-0.85). CECT images integrated with radiomics have great potential in differentiating uterine leiomyomas from leiomyosarcomas. Such a tool can be used to mitigate the risks of eventual surgical spread in the case of leiomyosarcoma and allow for safer fertility-sparing treatment in patients with benign uterine lesions.","20240419","Cancers","Department of Medical Physics, IRCCS Azienda Ospedaliero-Universitaria di Bologna, 40138 Bologna, Italy."

Therefore, we sought to investigate differential expression of miRNAs among adolescents and young adults with endometriosis. The Women's Health Study: from Adolescence to Adulthood (A2A) is an ongoing WERF EPHect compliant longitudinal cohort. Our analysis included 64 patients with surgically-confirmed endometriosis (96% rASRM stage I/II) and 118 females never diagnosed with endometriosis frequency matched on age (median = 21 years) and hormone use at blood draw. MicroRNA measurement was separated into discovery (10 cases and 10 controls) and internal replication (54 cases and 108 controls) phases. The levels of 754 plasma miRNAs were assayed in the discovery phase using PCR with rigorous internal control measures, with the relative expression of miRNA among cases vs. controls calculated using the 2-ΔΔCt method. miRNAs that were significant in univariate analyses stratified by hormone use were included in the internal replication phase. The internal replication phase was split 2:1 into a training and testing set and utilized FirePlex miRNA assay to assess 63 miRNAs in neural network analyses. The testing set of the validation phase was utilized to calculate the area under the curve (AUC) of the best fit models from the training set including hormone use as a covariate. In the discovery phase, 49 miRNAs were differentially expressed between endometriosis cases and controls. The associations of the 49 miRNAs differed by hormone use at the time of blood draw. Neural network analysis in the testing set of the internal replication phase determined a final model comprising 5 miRNAs (miR-542-3p, let-7b-3p, miR-548i, miR-769-5p, miR-30c-1-3p), yielding AUC = 0.77 (95% CI: 0.67-0.87, p < 0.001).

However, existing methods to predict an individual's sleep-loss phenotype are not scalable or involve effort-dependent neurobehavioural tests. To overcome these limitations, we sought to predict an individual's level of resilience or vulnerability to sleep loss using electroencephalographic (EEG) features obtained from routine night sleep. To this end, we retrospectively analysed five studies in which 96 healthy young adults (41 women) completed a laboratory baseline-sleep phase followed by a sleep-loss challenge. After classifying subjects into sleep-loss phenotypic groups, we extracted two EEG features from the first sleep cycle (median duration: 1.6 h), slow-wave activity (SWA) power and SWA rise rate, from four channels during the baseline nights. Using these data, we developed two sets of logistic regression classifiers (resilient versus not-resilient and vulnerable versus not-vulnerable) to predict the probability of sleep-loss resilience or vulnerability, respectively, and evaluated model performance using test datasets not used in model development. Consistently, the most predictive features came from the left cerebral hemisphere. For the resilient versus not-resilient classifiers, we obtained an average testing performance of 0.68 for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.72 for accuracy, 0.50 for sensitivity, 0.84 for specificity, 0.61 for positive predictive value, and 3.59 for likelihood ratio.

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 329 patients who underwent RARP at the Seoul National University Bundang Hospital between July 2021 and March 2023. Various pre- and intraoperative variables were collected, including ORi values. The relationship between ORi values and hypoxia occurrence was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curves and logistic regression analysis. Intraoperative hypoxia occurred in 18.8% of the patients. The receiver operating characteristic curve showed a satisfactory area under the curve of 0.762, with the ideal ORi cut-off value for predicting hypoxia set at 0.16. Sensitivity and specificity were 64.5% and 75.7%, respectively. An ORi value of < 0.16 and a higher body mass index were identified as independent risk factors of hypoxia during RARP. ORi monitoring provides a non-invasive approach to predict intraoperative hypoxia during RARP, enabling early management. Additionally, the significant relationship between a higher body mass index and hypoxia underscores the importance of individualized patient assessment.","20240413","World journal of urology","Department of Anesthesiology and Pain Medicine, Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, 13620, Korea."

Microarray data were downloaded from the Gene Expression Omnibus(GEO) database and used to screen for differential expressed genes(DEGs) in the SA and MDD datasets. A weighted gene co-expression network analysis(WGCNA) was used to identify the co-expression modules of SA and MDD. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operatoes(LASSO) and support vector machine(SVM) were used to determine critical biomarkers. Immune cell infiltration analysis was used to investigate the correlation between immune cell infiltration and common biomarkers of SA and MDD. Finally, validation of these analytical results was accomplished via the use of both in vivo and in vitro studies. The number of DEGs that were included in the MDD dataset was 5177, whereas the asthma dataset had 1634 DEGs. The intersection of DEGs for SA and MDD included 351 genes, the strongest positive modules of SA and MDD was 119 genes, which played a function in immunity. The intersection of DEGs and modular hub genes was 54, following the analysis using machine learning algorithms,three hub genes were identified and employed to formulate a nomogram and for the evaluation of diagnostic effectiveness, which demonstrated a significant diagnostic value (area under the curve from 0.646 to 0.979). Additionally, immunocyte disorder was identified by immune infiltration. In vitro studies have revealed that STK11IP deficiency aggravated the LPS/IFN-γinduced up-regulation in M1 macrophage activation.

Our objective was to assess the correlation between elevated SIRI values and adverse events related to the onset of T1DM. (2) Methods: This retrospective study, spanning ten years, included 187 patients with new-onset T1DM divided into three groups based on SIRI tertiles. The primary outcome was the occurrence of acute complications during hospital admission, while the secondary outcome was prolonged Intensive Care Unit (ICU) admission. (3) Results: Patients with high SIRI values were more likely to experience higher disease activity, leading to longer ICU admission times and more frequent complications. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the SIRI was independently associated with acute complications (p = 0.003) and prolonged ICU length of stay (p = 0.003). Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated the SIRI's superior predictive accuracy compared to venous pH (AUC = 0.837 and AUC = 0.811, respectively) and to the individual component cell lineages of the SIRI.

While geospatial environmental data, which provide detailed spatial information on ecosystems and land use, offer valuable insights into GHG sinks and sources, the potential of directly using remote sensing data from satellites remains largely unexplored. We predicted the spatial distribution of three major GHGs (CH4, CO2, and N2O) sinks and sources across Finland. Utilizing 143 field measurements, we compared the predictive capacity of three different data sets with MaxEnt machine-learning modeling: (1) geospatial environmental data including climate, topography and habitat variables, (2) remote sensing data (Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2), and (3) a combination of both. The combined dataset yielded the highest accuracy with an average test area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.845 and AUC stability of 0.928.

In contrast, using only remote sensing data resulted in reduced predictive accuracy (test AUC 0.763, stability AUC 0.927). Our results suggest that (1) reliable estimates of GHG sinks and sources cannot be produced with remote sensing data only and (2) integrating multiple data sources is recommended to achieve accurate and realistic predictions of GHG spatial patterns.","20240402","Environmental management","Natural Resources Institute Finland (Luke), Oulu, Finland. priscillia.christiani@luke.fi."

Nevertheless, accurate prediction of GC outcome may rely on multiple modalities with complementary information, particularly gene expression data. Thus, there is a need to develop multimodal learning methods to enhance prediction performance. In this paper, we collect a dataset from Ruijin Hospital and propose a multimodal learning method for GC diagnosis and outcome prediction, called GaCaMML, which is featured by a cross-modal attention mechanism and Per-Slide training scheme. Additionally, we perform feature attribution analysis via integrated gradient (IG) to identify important input features. The proposed method improves prediction accuracy over the single-modal learning method on three tasks, i.e., survival prediction (by 4.9% on C-index), pathological stage classification (by 11.6% on accuracy), and lymph node classification (by 12.0% on accuracy). Especially, the Per-Slide strategy addresses the issue of a high WSI-to-patient ratio and leads to much better results compared with the Per-Person training scheme. For the interpretable analysis, we find that although WSIs dominate the prediction for most samples, there is still a substantial portion of samples whose prediction highly relies on gene expression information. This study demonstrates the great potential of multimodal learning in GC-related prediction tasks and investigates the contribution of WSIs and gene expression, respectively, which not only shows how the model makes a decision but also provides insights into the association between macroscopic pathological phenotypes and microscopic molecular features.","20240417","Artificial intelligence in medicine","Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, 200240, China."

This study aimed to evaluate second MTP joint instability in patients with HV without dislocation via ultrasonography and investigate its relationship with the presence of PP injury or foot form. Between May 2018 and July 2023, symptomatic female patients with HV without any lesser toe deformity were included in this study. Second MTP joint instability was defined as the dorsal displacement ratio (DDR) of the passively subluxated proximal phalangeal articular surface on the metatarsal head articular surface. The presence of PP injury was assessed using ultrasonography. Foot ""form"" was determined by measuring standard foot bony angles on weight-bearing foot-ankle radiographs. The relationship between DDR or PP injury and radiographic measurements was investigated. Sixty-four patients (100 feet) were included. The average DDR of the second MTP joint in patients with HV without dislocation was 35.7%. There was an increase in the probability of PP injury, above a cutoff DDR value r of 35.4% (area under the curve = 0.712). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value for the presence of PP injury based on this cutoff level were 63.9%, 74.4%, 79.6%, and 56.9%, respectively. Metatarsalgia was reported in 21 feet (21.0%), of which 15 feet (71.4%) showed PP injury. An increase in DDR was weakly associated with increased metatarsus adductus angle and decreased second metatarsal height. In female patients with HV without second MTP dislocation, we found ultrasonographic evidence of second MTP plantar plate injury and joint instability to be a relatively common finding with a high prevalence in those with localized metatarsalgia.

By integrating diverse datasets and network structures, the research investigates the effectiveness of ML algorithms in improving diagnostic accuracy and automation potential. Both Multinominal Logistic Regression (MLR)-integrated and fully connected neuron layers are included in the analysis. The methods were trained using three variants of combinations of histopathological data and LN-RADS scale labels to assess their utility. The findings demonstrate that the LN-RADS scale improves prediction accuracy. MLR integration is shown to achieve higher accuracy, while the fully connected neuron approach excels in AUC performance. All of the above suggests a possibility for significant improvement in the early detection and prognosis of cancer using AI techniques. The study underlines the importance of further exploration into combined datasets and network architectures, which could potentially lead to even greater improvements in the diagnostic process.","20240419","Cancers","Copernicus Regional Multi-Specialty Oncology and Trauma Centre, 93-513 Lódź, Poland."

Development of further-decompensation worsens survival, while non-selective β-blockers (NSBBs) can modify the risk. However, how this applies to each stage is uncertain. We aimed to investigate, in each stage of decompensated-cirrhosis, the influence of further-decompensation on mortality and whether changes in portal-pressure (HVPG) under NSBBs influence these outcomes. Patients with variceal bleeding were consecutively included differentiating those with bleeding-alone from those who also had ascites. Patients with ascites and high-risk varices referred for primary-prophylaxis were also investigated. A baseline haemodynamic study was performed and was repeated after 1-3-months under NSBBs. Outcomes were investigated by competing-risk. Totally 103 patients had bleeding-alone, 186 bleeding-plus-ascites and 187 ascites-alone. Mean follow-up was 32-months (IQR, 12-60). Patients with bleeding-plus-ascites had higher HVPG and were more hyperdynamic than patients with ascites-alone and these than those with bleeding-alone. At each stage, the mortality risk was more than twice in patients developing further-decompensation vs. those without (p < .001). In each stage, HVPG-decrease under NSBBs showed better discrimination to predict further-decompensation than the baseline MELD, Child-Pugh or HVPG, by time-dependent ROC-curves (c-statistic >70%). At each stage, patients without HVPG-decreases, either ≥10% or ≥20% from the baseline, had higher risk of further-decompensation (sHR from 2.43 to 6.73, p < .01) and worse survival. In each stage of decompensated cirrhosis, mortality risk significantly and very markedly increase with further-decompensation. HVPG-non-response to NSBBs may adequately stratify the risk of further decompensation and death, in each stage. This suggests potential benefit with pre-emptive therapies in HVPG-non-responders at each-stage.","20240418","Liver international : official journal of the International Association for the Study of the Liver","Hospital de la Santa Creu i Sant Pau, Biomedical Research Institute Sant Pau (IIB Sant Pau), Universitat Autònoma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain."

This study comprised 191 patients postoperatively diagnosed with invasive breast cancer through multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging. Independent predictors were identified through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, culminating in the construction of a clinical model. Radiomic features were extracted from multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging images across various volume of interest scales (-2 mm, entire, +2 mm, +4 mm, and +6 mm). Subsequently, various radiomic models were developed using machine learning model algorithms, including logistic regression, support vector machine, k-nearest neighbor, gradient boosting machine, classification and regression tree, and random forest. A hybrid model was then formulated, amalgamating optimal radiomic and clinical models. The area under the curve of the clinical model was 0.757. Among the radiomic models, the most efficient diagnosis was achieved by the k-nearest neighbor-based radiomics-volume of interest (+2 mm), resulting in an area under the curve of 0.780. The hybrid model, integrating the k-nearest neighbor-based radiomics-volume of interest (+2 mm), and the clinical model surpassed the individual clinical and radiomics models, exhibiting a superior area under the curve of 0.864. Utilizing a hybrid approach integrating clinical data and multi-sequence magnetic resonance imaging-derived radiomics models based on the multiscale tumor region volume of interest (+2 mm) proved effective in determining lymphovascular invasion status in patients with invasive breast cancer.

In a biomarker discovery setting, 5 Olink panels of 96 proteins each, were used to determine protein levels. Biomarkers that were down-regulated and overexpressed in PSE patients, and those that showed the strongest interactions with other proteins were validated using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in samples from 50 PSE patients and 50 controls. A ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate the predictive ability of significant biomarkers to develop PSE. Mean age of the PSE discovery cohort was 68.56 ± 15.1, 40% women and baseline NIHSS 12 [IQR 1-25].

Patients were stratified into standard versus intermediate/high cytogenetic risk groups. After segmentation, 303 MRI features were extracted. Univariate and model-based methods were evaluated for feature and model selection. Testing was performed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and precision-recall curves. Models comparing the performance for genetic risk classification of the entire MRI protocol and of all MRI sequences separately were evaluated, including all features. Four final models, including only the top three most predictive features, were evaluated. Thirty-one patients were enrolled (mean age 66 ± 7 years, 15 men, 13 intermediate-/high-risk genetics). None of the univariate models and none of the models with all features included achieved good performance. The best performing model with only the three most predictive features and including all MRI sequences reached a ROC-area-under-the-curve of 0.80 and precision-recall-area-under-the-curve of 0.79. The highest statistical performance was reached when all three MRI sequences were combined (conventional whole-body MRI + DCE-MRI + DWI). Conventional MRI always outperformed the other sequences. DCE-MRI always outperformed DWI, except for specificity. A multiparametric MRI-based model has a better performance in the noninvasive prediction of high-risk cytogenetics in newly diagnosed MM than conventional MRI alone. An elaborate multiparametric MRI-based model performs better than conventional MRI alone for the noninvasive prediction of high-risk cytogenetics in newly diagnosed multiple myeloma; this opens opportunities to assess genetic heterogeneity thus overcoming sampling bias. • Standard genetic techniques in multiple myeloma patients suffer from sampling bias due to tumoral heterogeneity. • Multiparametric MRI noninvasively predicts genetic risk in multiple myeloma. • Combined conventional anatomical MRI, DCE-MRI, and DWI had the highest statistical performance to predict genetic risk. • Conventional MRI alone always outperformed DCE-MRI and DWI separately to predict genetic risk.

This study aims to adapt and validate a novel brief transdiagnostic screener, the Global Psychotrauma Screen (GPS), in Indonesian undergraduate students. An online survey was administered among Indonesian undergraduate students (N = 322). Exploratory factor analysis, reliability analyses, clinical validity analyses, and correlational analyses were performed to evaluate the construct validity, reliability, clinical validity, and convergent-divergent validity of the Indonesian GPS. Hierarchical multiple regression was conducted to assess the relationship between risk factors and trauma-related symptoms. The relationship between four categories of trauma-related symptom severity and social/work functioning was measured using Analysis of Covariance. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a single-factor solution. The Indonesian GPS demonstrated good internal consistency, test-retest correlation, and absolute agreement, indicating good reliability. The Indonesian GPS also had an acceptable area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity for a probable diagnosis of Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), Complex-PTSD (CPTSD), depression, and generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). We also established evidence for the convergent and divergent validity of GPS. The GPS risk factors (low psychological resilience, other stressful events, history of mental illness, and low social support) contributed to predicting trauma-related symptoms after controlling for gender, age, employment status, and faculty background. Additionally, in comparison to participants from the mild and low categories of GPS symptoms scores, participants from the severe and moderate category reported impaired lowered social/work functioning. The current findings indicate that the Indonesian GPS is a valid and reliable transdiagnostic trauma screener for Indonesian undergraduate students. This first comprehensive validation of the GPS in Indonesia calls for more research in Lower-middle Income Countries (LMICs) as a way towards prevention and early intervention for trauma-related symptoms.","20240416","Comprehensive psychiatry","Amsterdam UMC location University of Amsterdam, Psychiatry, Amsterdam Public Health, Amsterdam, the Netherlands; Faculty of Psychology, Universitas Indonesia, Depok, Indonesia.

A receiver-operating characteristic curve was plotted for laboratory markers to determine the area under the curve, or diagnostic accuracy, for septic arthritis and to evaluate thresholds that maximized sensitivity and specificity. There were 302 joint aspirations in 267 patients. Septic arthritis was diagnosed in 17.9% (54/302). Patients with synovial crystals were less likely to have septic arthritis (4.2% [5/119] vs. 26.8% [49/183], P < 0.0001). Septic arthritis in patients with no synovial crystals was associated with fever and a higher synovial white blood cell (WBC) count, synovial polymorphonuclear cell percentage (PMN%), serum WBC, and C-reactive protein (CRP) ( P < 0.05). Septic arthritis in patients with synovial crystals was only associated with inability to bear weight and a higher synovial WBC and CRP ( P < 0.05). Synovial PMN% was considered nondiagnostic of septic arthritis (area under the curve 0.56) in patients with crystals while synovial WBC and CRP had acceptable (0.76) and excellent (0.83) diagnostic utility, respectively.

In this study, we performed differential analysis of autophagy-related genes in rheumatoid arthritis patients using the GSE93272 dataset from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Marker genes were screened by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. Based on marker genes, we used unsupervised cluster analysis to elaborate different autophagy clusters, and further identified modules strongly associated with rheumatoid arthritis by weighted gene co-expression network analysis. In addition, we constructed four machine learning models, random forest model, support vector machine model, generalized linear model and extreme gradient boosting based on marker genes, and based on the optimal machine learning model, a nomogram model was constructed for distinguishing between normal individuals and rheumatoid arthritis patients. Finally, five external independent rheumatoid arthritis datasets were used for the validation of our results. The results showed that autophagy-related genes had significant expression differences between normal individuals and osteoarthritis patients. Through least absolute shrinkage and selection operator screening, we identified 31 marker genes and found that they exhibited significant synergistic or antagonistic effects in rheumatoid arthritis, and immune cell infiltration analysis revealed significant changes in immune cell abundance. Subsequently, we elaborated different autophagy clusters (cluster 1 and cluster 2) using unsupervised cluster analysis.

To date, select RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) have been proposed to be a mechanism underlying miRNA localization, but the overall relevance of RBPs in systematic miRNA sorting remains unclear. This study profiles intracellular and small extracellular vesicles' (sEVs) miRNAs in NPY-expressing hypothalamic neurons. These findings were corroborated by the publicly available sEV and intracellular miRNA profiles of white and brown adipocytes, endothelium, liver, and muscle from various databases. Using experimentally determined binding motifs of 93 RBPs, our enrichment analysis revealed that sEV-originating miRNAs contained significantly different RBP motifs than those of intracellularly retained miRNAs. Multiple RBP motifs were shared across cell types; for instance, RBM4 and SAMD4 are significantly enriched in neurons, hepatocytes, skeletal muscle, and endothelial cells. Homologs of both proteins physically interact with Argonaute1/2 proteins, suggesting that they play a role in miRNA sorting. Machine learning modelling also demonstrates that significantly enriched RBP motifs could predict cell-specific preferential miRNA sorting. Non-optimized machine learning modeling of the motifs using Random Forest and Naive Bayes in all cell types except WAT achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.77-0.84, indicating a high predictive accuracy. Given that the RBP motifs have a significant predictive power, these results underscore the critical role that RBPs play in miRNA sorting within mammalian cells and reinforce the importance of miRNA sequencing in preferential localization.

A retrospective longitudinal study was conducted in a real-world sample of older diabetic patients afferent to the outpatient facilities of the Diabetology Unit of the IRCCS INRCA Hospital of Ancona (Italy). A total of 1,001 T2D patients aged more than 70 years were consecutively evaluated by a multidimensional geriatric assessment, including physical performance evaluated using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB). The mortality was assessed during a 5-year follow-up. We used the automatic machine-learning (AutoML) JADBio platform to identify parsimonious mathematical models for risk stratification. Of 977 subjects included in the T2D cohort, the mean age was 76.5 (SD: 4.5) years and 454 (46.5%) were men. The mean follow-up time was 53.3 (SD:15.8) months, and 209 (21.4%) patients died by the end of the follow-up. The JADBio AutoML final model included age, sex, SPPB, chronic kidney disease, myocardial ischemia, peripheral artery disease, neuropathy, and myocardial infarction. The bootstrap-corrected concordance index (c-index) for the final model was 0.726 (95% CI: 0.687-0.763) with SPPB ranked as the most important predictor. Based on the penalized Cox regression model, the risk of death per unit of time for a subject with an SPPB score lower than five points was 3.35 times that for a subject with a score higher than eight points (P-value <0.001).

The credit card industry has existed due to a shift in consumer preferences and a rise in national economic growth. The number of issuing banks, card issuers, and transaction volumes has increased significantly. Nevertheless, owing to the growth in the number of transactions made with credit cards, both the total amount due and the rate of defaults on credit card loans have become issues that cannot be neglected. This issue must be resolved to ensure the continued and prosperous growth of the banking industry in the years to come. Currently, a few optimization algorithms-Whale optimization algorithm (WOA), Harmony Search (HS), Multi-verse optimization (MVO), and Vortex Search (VS)-have been used to achieve this purpose. However, because credit card default data is volatile and unequal, it is challenging for typical optimization algorithms to offer steady approaches with optimal performance. Studies have indicated that optimizing algorithms with suitable properties can significantly improve performance. To improve performance, some tuning was applied to the ANN. This study will assess twenty-three parameters, and the efficacy of all four approaches will be compared using ROC and AUC evaluations. The suggested model's performance is contrasted with a scenario where the classifiers were trained using original data. In contrast, the AUC values for VS-MLP were 0.7407 and 0.7271, while those for HS-MLP were 0.7074 and 0.6997. In the training and testing phases, AUC values of 0.7469 and 0.7329 from MVO-MLP and 0.72 and 0.7185 from WOA-MLP, respectively. The results show that the training accuracy of HS, VSA, MVO, and WOA are similar; MVO has the highest training accuracy.

Participants completed ecological momentary assessments assessing positive and negative affect and stress four times per day for five days and provided saliva samples at each time point. Saliva was assayed for cortisol, and area under the curve with respect to ground was computed. In a three-way interaction, both positive affect mean level and stress moderated the association between positive affect variability and cortisol (b = -1.55, t(100) = -3.29, SE = 0.47, p <.01, β = -4.05). When breaking down this three-way interaction, in the context of low stress and high mean positive affect, variability was positively related to total cortisol output. In contrast, in the context of high stress and high mean positive affect, variability was negatively related to total cortisol output. While greater positive affect variability is generally worse for health-relevant outcomes (as prior research has shown and as we show here at low levels of stress), at high levels of stress, fluctuation in affect may be adaptive. For someone experiencing a high stress week, having fluctuations in positive affect may mean that they are adaptively changing to meet their environmental needs especially when they typically report high mean positive affect levels. There were no associations between negative affect variability and cortisol secretion nor did mean negative affect or stress play a moderating role for negative affect variability. This study provides evidence that positive affect variability's association with cortisol secretion throughout the day may vary based on stress and mean positive affect levels.","20240429","Psychoneuroendocrinology","Chapman University, USA; University of California, Irvine, USA; Center on Stress and Health, USA.

The study was based on routine clinical data from electronic health records from the psychiatric services of the Central Denmark Region. A total of 74,880 patients with 1.59 million psychiatric service contacts were included in the analyses. We created 1343 potential predictors from 51 source variables, covering patient-level information on demographics, diagnoses, pharmacological treatment, and laboratory results. T2D was operationalised as HbA1c ≥48 mmol/mol, fasting plasma glucose ≥7.0 mmol/mol, oral glucose tolerance test ≥11.1 mmol/mol or random plasma glucose ≥11.1 mmol/mol. Two machine learning models (XGBoost and regularised logistic regression) were trained to predict T2D based on 85% of the included contacts. The predictive performance of the best performing model was tested on the remaining 15% of the contacts. The XGBoost model detected patients at high risk 2.7 years before T2D, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84. Of the 996 patients developing T2D in the test set, the model issued at least one positive prediction for 305 (31%). A machine learning model can accurately predict development of T2D among patients with mental illness based on routine clinical data from electronic health records.

However, time-activity curves extracted from the internal carotids are prone to partial-volume effects due to the limited PET resolution. This study aimed to assess the use of the internal carotids for quantifying brain glucose metabolism before and after partial-volume correction. Methods: Dynamic [18F]FDG images were acquired on a 106-cm-long PET scanner, and quantification was performed with a 2-tissue-compartment model and Patlak analysis using an IDIF extracted from the internal carotids. An IDIF extracted from the ascending aorta was used as ground truth. Results: The internal carotid IDIF underestimated the area under the curve by 37% compared with the ascending aorta IDIF, leading to Ki values approximately 17% higher. After partial-volume correction, the mean relative Ki differences calculated with the ascending aorta and internal carotid IDIFs dropped to 7.5% and 0.05%, when using a 2-tissue-compartment model and Patlak analysis, respectively. However, microparameters (K 1, k 2, k 3) derived from the corrected internal carotid curve differed significantly from those obtained using the ascending aorta. Conclusion: These results suggest that partial-volume-corrected internal carotids may be used to estimate Ki but not kinetic microparameters. Further validation in a larger patient cohort with more variable kinetics is needed for more definitive conclusions.","20240401","Journal of nuclear medicine : official publication, Society of Nuclear Medicine","Department of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging, University Medical Center Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands l.lopes.goncalves.da.providencia@umcg.nl."

This study included subjects (1,832 subjects, 3,276 knees) from the baseline of the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study (MOST). Patellofemoral joint regions of interest were identified using an automated landmark detection tool (BoneFinder) on lateral knee X-rays. An end-to-end deep learning method was developed for predicting PFOA progression based on imaging data in a five-fold cross-validation setting. To evaluate the performance of the models, a set of baselines based on known risk factors were developed and analyzed using gradient boosting machine (GBM). Risk factors included age, sex, body mass index, and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index score, and the radiographic osteoarthritis stage of the tibiofemoral joint (Kellgren and Lawrence [KL] score). Finally, to increase predictive power, we trained an ensemble model using both imaging and clinical data. Among the individual models, the performance of our deep convolutional neural network attention model achieved the best performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.856 and average precision (AP) of 0.431, slightly outperforming the deep learning approach without attention (AUC = 0.832, AP = 0.4) and the best performing reference GBM model (AUC = 0.767, AP = 0.334). The inclusion of imaging data and clinical variables in an ensemble model allowed statistically more powerful prediction of PFOA progression (AUC = 0.865, AP = 0.447), although the clinical significance of this minor performance gain remains unknown. The spatial attention module improved the predictive performance of the backbone model, and the visual interpretation of attention maps focused on the joint space and the regions where osteophytes typically occur. This study demonstrated the potential of machine learning models to predict the progression of PFOA using imaging and clinical variables. These models could be used to identify patients who are at high risk of progression and prioritize them for new treatments. However, even though the accuracy of the models were excellent in this study using the MOST dataset, they should be still validated using external patient cohorts in the future.","20240411","Methods of information in medicine","Research Unit of Health Sciences and Technology, University of Oulu, Oulu, Finland."

The study aimed to investigate the immunohistochemical reactivity of synovial cytokines associated with inflammation and the bone erosives/neoformatives processes among individuals diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis (PsA), rheumatoid arthritis (RA), osteoarthritis (OA), and radiographic axial spondyloarthritis (r-axSpA), with the intention of identifying potential biomarkers. Specimens were collected from the inflamed knee joints of patients referred for arthroscopic procedures, and the synovial tissue (ST) was prepared for quantifying protein expression through immunohistochemical analysis (% expressed in Ratio_Area-Intensity) for TGF-β1, IL-17A, Dkk1, BMP2, BMP4, and Wnt5b. The collected data underwent thorough analysis and examination of their predictive capabilities utilising receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Valid synovial tissue samples were acquired from 40 patients for IHC quantification analysis. Initially, these patients had not undergone treatment with biologics. However, after 5 years, 4 out of 13 patients diagnosed with PsA and two out of nine patients diagnosed with RA had commenced biologic treatments. Individuals with early PsA who received subsequent biologic treatment exhibited significantly elevated IHC reactivity in ST for TGF-β1 (p = 0.015). Additionally, patients with both PsA and RA who underwent biologic therapy displayed increased IHC reactivity for IL-17A (p = 0.016), TGF-β1 (p = 0.009), and Dkk1 (p = 0.042).

In this multicenter study, the authors examined whether seismocardiography using commercially available smartphones can differentiate control subjects from patients with stage C HF. Both inpatients and outpatients with HF were enrolled from Finland and the United States. Inpatients with HF were assessed within 2 days of admission, and outpatients were assessed in the ambulatory setting. In a prespecified pooled data analysis, algorithms were derived using logistic regression and then validated using a bootstrap aggregation method. A total of 217 participants with HF (174 inpatients and 172 outpatients) and 786 control subjects from cardiovascular clinics were enrolled. The mean age of participants with acute HF was 64 ± 13 years, 64.9% were male, left ventricular ejection fraction was 39% ± 15%, and median N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide was 5,778 ng/L (Q1-Q3: 1,933-6,703).

Both coronary artery calcium scoring by computed tomography (CT) and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are used to identify patients at increased risk for ischemic heart disease, thereby indicating a higher cardiovascular risk profile. Our study aimed to investigate the utility of these techniques in the CKD population. In patients with CKD, OCT was used to measure the choroidal thickness (CHT) and the thickness of the peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL). A total of 127 patients were included, including 70 men (55%) with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 39 ± 30 mL/min/1.73 m2. Lower pRNFL thickness was found to be related to high-sensitivity troponin I (r = -0.362, p < 0.001) and total coronary calcification (r = -0.194, p = 0.032). In a multivariate analysis, pRNFL measurements remained associated with age (β = -0.189; -0.739--0.027; p = 0.035) and high-sensitivity troponin I (β = -0.301; -0.259--0.071; p < 0.001). Severe coronary calcification (Agatston score ≥ 400 HU) was related to a worse eGFR (p = 0.008), a higher grade of CKD (p = 0.036), and a thinner pRNFL (p = 0.011). The ROC curve confirmed that the pRNFL measurement could determine the patients with an Agatston score of ≥400 HU (AUC 0.638; 95% CI 0.525-0.750; p = 0.015).

The introduction of rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) for malaria continues to drive patient management and care. Malaria-negative cases are commonly treated with antibiotics without confirmation of bacteraemia. Conventional laboratory tests for differential diagnosis require skilled staff and appropriate access to healthcare facilities. In addition, introducing single-disease RDTs instead of conventional laboratory tests remains costly. To overcome some of the delivery challenges of multiple separate tests, a multiplexed RDT with the capacity to diagnose a diverse range of tropical fevers would be a cost-effective solution. In this study, a multiplex lateral flow immunoassay (DPP Fever Panel II Assay) that can detect serum immunoglobulin M (IgM) and specific microbial antigens of common fever agents in Asia (Orientia tsutsugamushi, Rickettsia typhi, Leptospira spp., Burkholderia pseudomallei, Dengue virus, Chikungunya virus, and Zika virus), was evaluated. Whole blood (WB) and serum samples from 300 patients with undefined febrile illness (UFI) recruited in Vientiane, Laos PDR were tested using the DPP Fever Panel II, which consists of an Antibody panel and Antigen panel. To compare reader performance, results were recorded using two DPP readers, DPP Micro Reader (Micro Reader 1) and DPP Micro Reader Next Generation (Micro Reader 2). WB and serum samples were run on the same fever panel and read on both micro readers in order to compare results. ROC analysis and equal variance analysis were performed to inform the diagnostic validity of the test compared against the respective reference standards of each fever agent (S1 Table). Overall better AUC values were observed in whole blood results. No significant difference in AUC performance was observed when comparing whole blood and serum sample testing, except for when testing for R. typhi IgM (p = 0.04), Leptospira IgM (p = 0.02), and Dengue IgG (p = 0.03). Linear regression depicted R2 values had ~70% agreement across WB and serum samples, except when testing for leptospirosis and Zika, where the R2 values were 0.37 and 0.47, respectively. No significant difference was observed between the performance of Micro Reader 1 and Micro Reader 2, except when testing for the following pathogens: Zika IgM, Zika IgG, and B pseudomallei CPS Ag. These results demonstrate that the diagnostic accuracy of the DPP Fever Panel II is comparable to that of commonly used RDTs. The optimal cut-off would depend on the use of the test and the desired sensitivity and specificity. Further studies are required to authenticate the use of these cut-offs in other endemic regions.

Analyzing pre-treatment serum from 77 advanced PDAC patients via ELISA, the research determined optimal cutoff values for IL-6 and the IL-6:sIL-6Rα ratio using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, which then facilitated the division of patients into low and high IL-6 groups, showing significantly different survival outcomes. Notably, high IL-6 levels correlated with adverse features such as poorly differentiated histology, higher tumor burden, and low albumin levels, indicating a stronger likelihood of poorer prognosis. With a median follow-up of 9.28 months, patients with lower IL-6 levels experienced markedly better median overall survival and progression-free survival than those with higher levels, underscoring IL-6's role in predicting disease prognosis. Multivariate analysis further confirmed IL-6 levels, alongside older age, and elevated neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, as predictors of worse outcomes, suggesting that IL-6 could be a critical biomarker for tailoring treatment strategies in advanced PDAC, warranting further investigation into its role in systemic inflammation and the tumor microenvironment.","20240418","Biomedicines","Division of Medical Oncology, Department of Internal Medicine, The Catholic University of Korea, Seoul St. Mary's Hospital, Seoul 06591, Republic of Korea."

We aimed to investigate the impact of circadian rhythms on immune function and inflammation and their contribution to SLE progression to lupus nephritis (LN). This study retrospectively analysed the clinical characteristics and transcriptional profiles of 373 samples using bioinformatics and machine-learning methods. A flare risk score (FRS) was established to predict overall disease progression for patients with lupus. Mendelian randomisation was used to analyse the causal relationship between CRD and SLE progression. Abnormalities in the circadian pathway were detected in patients with SLE, and lower enrichment levels suggested a disease state (normalised enrichment score=0.6714, p=0.0062). The disruption of circadian rhythms was found to be closely linked to lupus flares, with the FRS showing a strong ability to predict disease progression (area under the curve (AUC) of 5-year prediction: 0.76). The accuracy of disease prediction was improved by using a prognostic nomogram based on FRS (AUC=0.77). Additionally, Mendelian randomisation analysis revealed an inverse causal relationship between CRD and SLE (OR 0.6284 (95% CI 0.3630 to 1.0881), p=0.0485) and a positive causal relationship with glomerular disorders (OR 0.0337 (95% CI 1.634e-3 to 6.934e-1), p=0.0280). Our study reveals that genetic characteristics arising from CRD can serve as biomarkers for predicting the exacerbation of SLE. This highlights the crucial impact of CRD on the progression of lupus.","20240409","Lupus science & medicine","Key Laboratory of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics, Haihe Laboratory of Cell Ecosystem, State Key Laboratory of Natural Medicines, China Pharmaceutical University, Nanjing, People's Republic of China."

Research findings are, however, inconsistent and the mechanisms involved are unclear. This study investigated the CAR and TAR in male athletes across light and heavy training weeks, focusing on skeletal muscle damage as a mediating factor. Twenty elite male judokas were assessed across consecutive weeks of light and heavy training (i.e., 6 days, 9-10 weekly sessions). Plasma cortisol and testosterone concentrations were measured post-awakening (+3, +30, +60 mins), along with creatine kinase (CK) at +3 mins. The CAR and TAR were indexed by baseline-corrected change scores (Δb30, Δb60) and area under the curve (AUCb30, AUCb60). The early-morning surge in plasma cortisol concentration (CARΔb30, CARΔb60, CARAUCb30, CARAUCb60) was significantly larger after light versus heavy training with effect-size differences of 2.14-2.64. The post-awakening decline in plasma testosterone (TARΔb30, TARAUCb30, TARAUCb60) was found to be significantly less pronounced, whilst CK level was elevated, after heavy than light training with effect-size differences of 0.95-1.04 and 4.70, respectively. Causal mediation analysis confirmed that CK mediated, in part, the training effect on the CAR, but not TAR, measures. In summary, male judokas, upon rising after a light training block, displayed a rising CAR (36%, 22%) and declining TAR (-11%, -15%) at +30 and +60 mins. A high-intensity training block suppressed the CAR (21%, 8%) and attenuated the TAR (-7%, -13%) with accompanying muscle damage offering one mechanism to partly explain the CAR differences.","20240425","Biology of sport","School of Science and Technology, University of New England, Armidale, Australia."

We then developed and validated nomograms to predict the 3-, 6- and 12-month OS of rATC and the results were evaluated by C-index and calibration curves. After application of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 1338 ATC and 127 PSCCTh patients were included in the study. Further, OS and CSS of patients with PSCCTh were better than that of patients with ATC. Prognostic factors were not identical for the two cancers. Multivariate Cox model analysis indicated that age, tumor size, metastasis, surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy are independent prognostic factors for CSS in patients with ATC; while for patients with PSCCTh, the corresponding factors are age, and surgery. We selected six survival predictors (age, tumor size, metastasis, surgery, radiation, and, chemotherapy) for nomogram construction. The C-indexes in the training and validation cohort were 0.740 and 0.778, respectively, reflecting the good discrimination ability of the model. The calibration curves also showed good consistency in the probability of 3-, 6-, and 12-month OS between the actual observation and the nomogram prediction. We constructed a nomogram to provide a convenient and reliable tool for predicting OS in rATC patients. Prognostic factors influencing CSS were not identical in patients with ATC and PSCCTh. These findings indicate that different clinical treatment and management plans are required for patients with these two types of thyroid cancer.","20240407","International journal of clinical oncology","Department of General Surgery, the 920th Hospital of Joint Logistics Support Force, PLA, Kunming, Yunnan, People's Republic of China. zhangchuyue0215@163.com."

In the discovery phase, partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) showed that plasma metabolites were significantly different between recurrent and non-recurrent breast cancer patients. Metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA) and metabolomic pathway analysis (MetPA) showed that valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation was the significant pathway, and volcano plot showed significant ten upregulated and two downregulated metabolites between recurrent and non-recurrent cases. Combined with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and biological significance, creatine, valine, methionine, and mannose were selected for the validation phase. In this patient cohort with 41 new-recurrent vs. 248 non-recurrent breast cancer cases, followed for 720.49 person-years, compared with low level of valine, high valine level was significantly negatively associated with recurrent breast cancer (aHR: 0.36, 95% CI: 0.18-0.72, P = 0.004), especially in ER-negative and PR-negative status. There were interaction effects between valine and ER (Pinteraction = 0.006) as well as PR (Pinteraction = 0.002) on recurrent breast cancer.

The gold standard for diagnosing endometriosis is laparoscopy, which is invasive and accompanied by several risks. Currently, there are no effective non-invasive biomarkers for diagnosing endometriosis. Here, we investigated whether metabolites whose levels are altered in patients with endometriosis hold potential as diagnostic biomarkers for the disease. This case-control study involved 32 patients with endometriosis and 29 patients with other benign gynecological disease. The diagnosis of all patients was confirmed through postoperative histopathological examination, and the patients were divided into two groups: an endometriosis group (EM) and a control group. Fasting blood was collected and used for non-targeted metabolomic-based detection. The data were processed through principal component analysis, orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis, and significance analysis of microarrays. A univariate receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate the diagnostic value of the metabolites. The metabolite profiles of patients with endometriosis were markedly different compared with those of the controls. In addition, several metabolic pathways, including biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids, arginine biosynthesis, and glutathione metabolism, were altered. Ornithine and medorinone showed better potential as biomarkers for endometriosis diagnosis than CA125. We analyzed the altered metabolic profiles in patients with endometriosis and found ornithine and medorinone as potential non-invasive biomarkers for endometriosis diagnosis, whereas the combined ornithine-medorinone diagnosis is more valuable. These findings may help advance research on non-invasive diagnostic biomarkers for endometriosis. Further research with an improved study design and a larger cohort should be performed to confirm the diagnostic potential and clinical application of these biomarkers.","20240422","Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)","Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Shandong Provincial Hospital, No.324, Jingwuweiqi Road, Jinan, 250021, People's Republic of China."

However, such a scoring system must incorporate a variety of clinical outcomes of acute cholangitis (AC). In an emergency department (ED)-based setting, where efficiency and practicality are highly desired, clinicians may find the application of various parameters challenging. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and blood urea nitrogen-to-albumin ratio (BAR) are relatively common biomarkers used to assess disease severity. This study evaluated the potential value of TG2018 scores measured in an ED to predict a variety of clinical outcomes. Furthermore, the study also compared TG2018 scores with NLR and BAR scores to demonstrate their usefulness. Methods: This retrospective observational study was performed in an ED. In total, 502 patients with AC visited the ED between January 2016 and December 2021. The primary endpoint was to evaluate whether the TG2018 scoring system measured in the ED was a predictor of intensive care, long-term hospital stays (≥14 days), percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage (PTBD) during admission care, and endotracheal intubation (ETI). Results: The analysis included 81 patients requiring intensive care, 111 requiring long-term hospital stays (≥14 days), 49 requiring PTBD during hospitalization, and 14 requiring ETI during hospitalization. For the TG2018 score, the adjusted OR (aOR) using (1) as a reference was 23.169 (95% CI: 9.788-54.844) for (3) compared to (1). The AUC of the TG2018 for the need for intensive care was 0.850 (95% CI: 0.815-0.881) with a cutoff of >2. The AUC for long-term hospital stays did not exceed 0.7 for any of the markers. the AUC for PTBD also did not exceed 0.7 for any of the markers. The AUC for ETI was the highest for BAR at 0.870 (95% CI: 0.837-0.899) with a cutoff value of >5.2. Conclusions: The TG2018 score measured in the ED helps predict various clinical outcomes of AC. Other novel markers such as BAR and NLR are also associated, but their explanatory power is weak.","20240416","Journal of clinical medicine","Department of Emergency Medicine, Inha University Hospital, College of Medicine, Inha University, 27, Inhang-ro, Jung-gu, Incheon 22332, Republic of Korea."

However, the biological characteristics of early-stage Ns-NSCLC, especially in the Chinese population, are still unclear. Multi-omics interrogation of early-stage Ns-NSCLC (stage I-III), paired blood samples and normal lung tissues (n=76) by whole-exome sequencing (WES), RNA sequencing, and T-cell receptor (TCR) sequencing were conducted. An average of 128 exonic mutations were identified, and the most frequently mutant gene was EGFR (55%), followed by TP53 (37%) and TTN (26%). Mutations in MUC17, ABCA2, PDE4DIP, and MYO18B predicted significantly unfavorable disease-free survival (DFS). Moreover, cytobands amplifications in 8q24.3, 14q13.1, 14q11.2, and deletion in 3p21.1 were highlighted in recurrent cases. Higher incidence of human leukocyte antigen loss of heterozygosity (HLA-LOH), higher tumor mutational burden (TMB) and tumor neoantigen burden (TNB) were identified in ever-smokers than never-smokers. HLA-LOH also correlated with higher TMB, TNB, intratumoral heterogeneity (ITH), and whole chromosomal instability (wCIN) scores. Interestingly, higher ITH was an independent predictor of better DFS in early-stage Ns-NSCLC. Up-regulation of immune-related genes, including CRABP2, ULBP2, IL31RA, and IL1A, independently portended a dismal prognosis. Enhanced TCR diversity of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) predicted better prognosis, indicative of a noninvasive method for relapse surveillance. Eventually, seven machine-learning (ML) algorithms were employed to evaluate the predictive accuracy of clinical, genomic, transcriptomic, and TCR repertoire data on DFS, showing that clinical and RNA features combination in the random forest (RF) algorithm, with area under the curve (AUC) of 97.5% and 83.3% in the training and testing cohort, respectively, significantly outperformed other methods.

The application of transcutaneous stimulation to activate ventral nerve roots directly at the level of the conus medularis (bypassing the brain and spinal cord) has emerged as a method to potentially monitor the motor component of the femoral plexus and lumbosacral nerves free from the blunting effects of general anesthesia. To evaluate the reliability and efficacy of transabdominal motor evoked potentials (TaMEPs) compared to TcMEPs during lumbosacral spine procedures.

Baseline reliability, false positive rate, true positive rate, false negative rate, area under the curve at baseline and at alerts, and detection of preoperative deficits of TcMEPs and TaMEPs were compared and analyzed for statistical significance. The relationship between transcutaneous stimulation voltage level and patient BMI was also examined. TaMEPs were significantly more reliable than TcMEPs in all muscles except abductor hallucis. Of the 27 false positive alerts, 24 were TcMEPs alone, and 3 were TaMEPs alone. Of the 19 true positives, none were detected by TcMEPs alone, 3 were detected by TaMEPs alone (TcMEPs were not present), and the remaining 16 true positives involved TaMEPs and TcMEPs. TaMEPs had a significantly larger area under the curve (AUC) at baseline than TcMEPs in all muscles except abductor hallucis. The percent decrease in TcMEP and TaMEP AUC during LLIF alerts was not significantly different. Both TcMEPs and TaMEPs reflected three preexisting motor deficits.

These ROIs were employed as inputs for a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict lesion status. Also, transfer learning was utilized, incorporating 12 pre-trained CNN models. Subsequently, an ensemble technique was applied to 3 of best models, followed by a systematic comparison of the results. Through a 5-fold cross-validation, our custom designed network exhibited an average accuracy of 85 %, a sensitivity of 95 %, a specificity of 75 %, and an AUC value of 0.90.

A total of 193 patients with carotid atherosclerotic plaques were retrospectively enrolled and allocated into either a symptomatic (n = 123) or an asymptomatic (n = 70) groups. SR CTA images were derived from NR CTA images using deep learning-based three-dimensional SR technology. Handcrafted radiomic features were extracted from both the SR and NR CTA images and three risk models were developed based on manually measured quantitative CTA characteristics and NR and SR radiomic features. Model performances were assessed via receiver operating characteristic, calibration, and decision curve analyses. The SR model exhibited the optimal performance (area under the curve [AUC] 0.820, accuracy 0.802, sensitivity 0.854, F1 score 0.847) in the testing cohort, outperforming the other two models. The calibration curve analyses and Hosmer-Lemeshow test demonstrated that the SR model exhibited the best goodness of fit, and decision curve analysis revealed that SR model had the highest clinical value and potential patient benefits. Deep learning-based three-dimensional SR technology could improve the CTA-based radiomic models in identifying symptomatic carotid plaques, potentially providing more accurate and valuable information to guide clinical decision-making to reduce the risk of ischemic stroke.","20240409","Heliyon","Department of Medical Imaging, First Hospital of Shanxi Medical University, Taiyuan, Shanxi Province, 030001, China."

Clinical data and miRNA levels (miR-199a-3p, miR-365-3p, miR-200b-3p, miR-195-5p, miR-335-5p, and miR-185-5p) in tears, blood, and aqueous humor were collected. Treatment response was categorized into responders and non-responders based on visual acuity and central subfield thickness. MiRNA levels were quantified using reverse-transcription PCR. Statistical analyses were performed, including ROC analysis, to evaluate predictive accuracy. Dysregulated miRNA profiles were observed in wet AMD tears and blood compared to controls. Specifically, miR-199a-3p, miR-195-5p, and miR-185-5p were upregulated, while miR-200b-3p was downregulated in tears. All six miRNAs were elevated in wet AMD blood samples. Notably, responders showed higher tear expression of miR-195-5p and miR-185-5p. Combining these miRNAs yielded the highest predictive power (AUC = 0.878, p = 0.006) for anti-VEGF responders. Dysregulated miRNA profiles in tears and blood suggest their potential as biomarkers for wet AMD. MiR-195-5p and miR-185-5p in tears demonstrate predictive value for anti-VEGF treatment responders.

However, factors such as patellar height (PH) and the sagittal plane's posterior tibial slope angle (PTSA) are potentially overlooked. This study investigated the impact of alignment correction angle guided by computer-designed personalized surgical guide plate (PSGP) in MOWHTO on PH and PTSA, offering insights for enhancing surgical techniques. This retrospective study included patients who underwent 3D-printed PSGP-assisted MOWHTO at our institution from March to September 2022. The paired t-tests assessed differences in all preoperative and postoperative measurement parameters. Multivariate linear regression analysis examined correlations between PTSA, CDI (Caton-Deschamps Index), and the alignment correction magnitude. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis determined the threshold of the correction angle, calculating sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve. A total of 107 patients were included in our study. The CDI changed from a preoperative mean of 0.97 ± 0.13 (range 0.70-1.34) to a postoperative mean of 0.82 ± 0.13 (range 0.55-1.20). PTSA changed from a preoperative mean of 8.54 ± 2.67 (range 2.19-17.55) to a postoperative mean of 10.54 ± 3.05 (range 4.48-18.05). The t-test revealed statistically significant changes in both values (p < 0.05). A significant alteration in patellar height occurred when the correction angle exceeded 9.39°. Moreover, this paper illustrates a negative correlation between CDI change and the correction angle and preoperative PTSA. Holding other factors constant, each 1-degree increase in the correction angle led to a 0.017 decrease in postoperative CDI, and each 1-degree increase in preoperative PTSA resulted in a 0.008 decrease in postoperative CDI. PTSA change was positively correlated only with the correction angle; for each 1-degree increase in the opening angle, postoperative PTS increased by 0.188, with other factors constant. This study highlights the effectiveness and precision of PSGP-assisted MOWHTO, focusing on the impact of alignment correction on PH and PTSA. These findings support the optimization of PSGP technology, which offers simpler, faster, and safer surgeries with less radiation and bleeding than traditional methods. However, PSGP's one-time use design and the learning curve required for its application are limitations, suggesting areas for further research.","20240401","Orthopaedic surgery","Tianjin Hospital, Tianjin, China."

This concern is all the more important as computational pathology has leveraged large public datasets that underrepresent certain demographic groups. Using publicly available data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and the EBRAINS brain tumor atlas, as well as internal patient data, we show that whole-slide image classification models display marked performance disparities across different demographic groups when used to subtype breast and lung carcinomas and to predict IDH1 mutations in gliomas. For example, when using common modeling approaches, we observed performance gaps (in area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) between white and Black patients of 3.0% for breast cancer subtyping, 10.9% for lung cancer subtyping and 16.0% for IDH1 mutation prediction in gliomas. We found that richer feature representations obtained from self-supervised vision foundation models reduce performance variations between groups. These representations provide improvements upon weaker models even when those weaker models are combined with state-of-the-art bias mitigation strategies and modeling choices. Nevertheless, self-supervised vision foundation models do not fully eliminate these discrepancies, highlighting the continuing need for bias mitigation efforts in computational pathology. Finally, we demonstrate that our results extend to other demographic factors beyond patient race. Given these findings, we encourage regulatory and policy agencies to integrate demographic-stratified evaluation into their assessment guidelines.","20240419","Nature medicine","Department of Pathology, Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, USA."

The RISE model was built using cell line-based mRNA sequencing data from five tumor types with varying radiation sensitivity. Through four cell-derived datasets, two public tissue-derived cohorts, and one local cohort of 42 nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients, we demonstrated that RISE could effectively predict the level of radiation sensitivity (area under the ROC curve [AUC] from 0.666 to 1 across different datasets). After the verification by the colony formation assay and flow cytometric analysis of apoptosis, our four well-established radioresistant cell models successfully proved higher RISE values in radioresistant cells by RT-qPCR experiments.

It is characterised by the persistence of associated symptoms after the acute phase of the illness has subsided. Although several studies have investigated the risk factors associated with long COVID, identifying which patients will experience long-term symptoms remains a complex task. Among the various symptoms, dyspnea is one of the most prominent due to its close association with the respiratory nature of COVID-19 and its disabling consequences. This work proposes a new intelligent clinical decision support system to predict dyspnea 12 months after a severe episode of COVID-19 based on the SeguiCovid database from the Álvaro Cunqueiro Hospital in Vigo (Galicia, Spain). The database is initially processed using a CART-type decision tree to identify the variables with the highest predictive power. Based on these variables, a cascade of expert systems has been defined with Mamdani-type fuzzy-inference engines. The rules for each system were generated using the Wang-Mendel automatic rule generation algorithm. At the output of the cascade, a risk indicator is obtained, which allows for the categorisation of patients into two groups: those with dyspnea and those without dyspnea at 12 months. This simplifies follow-up and the performance of studies aimed at those patients at risk. The system has produced satisfactory results in initial tests, supported by an AUC of 0.75, demonstrating the potential and usefulness of this tool in clinical practice.","20240412","Biomedicines","Fundación Pública Galega de Investigación Biomédica Galicia Sur, Hospital Álvaro Cunqueiro, 36312 Vigo, Spain."

We aimed to compare the invasive, Doppler wire-based coronary flow reserve (CFR) with the non-invasive transthoracic Doppler echocardiography (TTDE)-derived CFR, and their ability to predict infarct size. Methods: We included 36 patients with invasive Doppler wire assessment on days 3-7 after STEMI treated with primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI), of which TTDE-derived CFR was measured in 47 vessels (29 patients) within 6 h of the invasive Doppler. Infarct size was assessed by cardiac magnetic resonance at a median of 8 months. Results: The correlation between invasive and non-invasive CFR was modest in the overall cohort (rho 0.400, p = 0.005). It improved when only measurements in the LAD artery were considered (rho 0.554, p = 0.002), with no significant correlation in the RCA artery (rho -0.190, p = 0.435). Both invasive (AUC 0.888) and non-invasive (AUC 0.868) CFR, measured in the recanalized culprit artery, showed a good ability to predict infarct sizes ≥18% of the left ventricular mass, with the optimal cut off values of 1.85 and 1.80, respectively. Conclusions: In patients with STEMI, TTDE- and Doppler wire-derived CFR exhibit significant correlation, when measured in the LAD artery, and both have a similarly strong association with the final infarct size.","20240424","Journal of clinical medicine","Department of Cardiology, University Clinical Center of Serbia, 11000 Belgrade, Serbia."

A large-scale unbiased proteomics screen was used to compare proteins (N = 6,345) in blood plasma of normal healthy controls (N = 49) with adult-onset focal dystonia (N = 143) consisting of specific subpopulations of cervical dystonia (N = 45), laryngeal dystonia (N = 49), and blepharospasm (N = 49). Pathway analyses were conducted to identify relevant biological pathways. Finally, protein changes were used to build a prediction model for dystonia. After correction for multiple comparisons, 15 proteins were associated with adult-onset focal dystonia. Subgroup analyses revealed some proteins were shared across the dystonia subgroups while others were unique to 1 subgroup. The top biological pathways involved changes in the immune system, metal ion transport, and reactive oxygen species. A 4-protein model showed high accuracy in discriminating control individuals from dystonia cases [average area under the curve (AUC) = 0.89].

In the ICU, monitoring of cardiac index (CI) and heart rate (HR) is commonly used to guide management and predict outcomes in septic shock patients. However, there is a lack of research on the association between CI and HR and the risk of mortality in this patient population. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between different levels of CI and HR and mortality in septic shock patients. Data analysis was obtained from the MIMIC-IV version 2.0 database. Sepsis and septic shock were primarily defined by sepsis-3, the third international consensus on sepsis and septic shock. CI was computed using cardiac output (CO) and body surface area (BSA). To evaluate the incidence of CI with respect to each endpoint (7-, 14-, 21-, and 28-day mortality), a restricted cubic spline curve function (RCS) was used. The optimal cutoff value for predicted mortality was determined using the Youden index. Analyses of KM curves, cox regression, and logistic regression were conducted separately to determine the relationship between various CI and HR and 28-day mortality. This study included 1498 patients with septic shock. A U-shaped relationship between CI levels and risk of mortality in septic shock was found by RCS analysis (p < 0.001). CI levels within the intermediate range of 1.85-2.8 L/min/m2 were associated with a mortality hazard ratio (HR) < 1. In contrast, low CI (HR = 1.87 95% CI: 1.01-3.49) and high CI (HR = 1.93 95% CI: 1.26-2.97) had a significantly increased risk of mortality. The AUC for heart rate prediction of mortality by Youden index analysis was 0.70 95%CI:0.64-0.76 with a cut-off value of 93.63 bpm. According to the characteristics of HR and CI, patients were divided into six subgroups HR↓+CI intermediate group (n = 772), HR↓+CI↓ group (n = 126), HR↓+CI↑ group (n = 294), HR↑+CI intermediate group (n = 132), HR↑+CI↓ group (n = 24), and HR↑+CI↑ group (n = 150). The KM curves, COX regression, and logistic regression analysis showed that the survival rates the of HR↓+CI intermediate group, HR↓+CI↓ group, and HR↓+CI↑ were higher than the other groups. The risk factors of HR↑+CI intermediate group, HR↑+CI↓, and HR↑+CI↑ with ICU 28-day mortality were HR = 2.91 (95% CI: 1.39-5.97), HR = 3.67 (95% CI: 1.39-11.63), and HR = 5.77 (95% CI: 2.98-11.28), respectively.

Manual diagnosis is a long and expensive process with a specific risk of misdiagnosis. Computer-aided diagnosis can provide more accurate and practical treatment recommendations. In this paper, we propose a multi-view joint learning DR diagnostic model called RT2Net, which integrates the global features of fundus images and the local detailed features of vascular images to reduce the limitations of single fundus image learning. Firstly, the original image is preprocessed using operations such as contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization, and the vascular structure of the extracted DR image is segmented. Then, the vascular image and fundus image are input into two branch networks of RT2Net for feature extraction, respectively, and the feature fusion module adaptively fuses the feature vectors' output from the branch networks. Finally, the optimized classification model is used to identify the five categories of DR. This paper conducts extensive experiments on the public datasets EyePACS and APTOS 2019 to demonstrate the method's effectiveness. The accuracy of RT2Net on the two datasets reaches 88.2% and 85.4%, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is 0.98 and 0.96, respectively.

This was a single-center, retrospective study. An image dataset of 3460 unilateral hip images from 1730 patients (age ⩾50 years) was retrospectively collected with matched DXA assessment for T-score for the targeted proximal hip regions to train (2473 unilateral hip images from 1430 patients) and test (497 unilateral hip images from 300 patients) the proposed CNN model. All images were processed with a fully automated CNN model, X1AI-Osteo. The proposed screening tool illustrated a better performance (sensitivity: 97.2%; specificity: 95.6%; positive predictive value: 95.7%; negative predictive value: 97.1%; area under the curve: 0.96) than the open-sourced CNN models in predicting osteoporosis. Moreover, when combining variables, including age, body mass index, and sex as features in the training metric, there was high consistency in the T-score on the targeted hip regions between the proposed CNN model and the DXA (r = 0.996, p < 0.001). The proposed CNN model may identify osteoporosis and predict T-scores on the targeted hip regions from simple hip radiographs with high accuracy, highlighting the future application for population-based opportunistic osteoporosis screening with low cost and high adaptability for a broader population at risk.

To examine the validity and performance of RECAM-J 2023, clinical information on DILI and non-DILI cases in Japan were retrospectively collected. The diagnosis of DILI was made by expert's decision. Then we scored each case using RECAM-J 2023, and calculated area under curve (AUC) values for identification for DILI. We collected data from 538 DILI and 128 non-DILI cases. The sum of highly probable (HP) and probable (PR) cases categorized by RECAM-J 2023 were only 206 (38%) in DILI cases. As the primary cause of low scores was the deduction with missing hepatitis virus markers, which is unlikely to be an issue in prospective applications, we rescored without these deductions. At this time, the sum of HP and PR was raised to 421 (78%). The AUCs of RECAM-J 2023 without deductions were 0.70 and 0.88 for identifying at least HP, and at least PR, respectively.

In this research, we introduce a novel predictor KbhbXG, which utilizes XGBoost to identify β-hydroxybutyrylation modification sites based on protein sequence information. The traditional experimental methods employed for the identification of β-hydroxybutyrylated sites using proteomic techniques are both costly and time-consuming. Thus, the development of computational methods and predictors can play a crucial role in facilitating the rapid identification of β-hydroxybutyrylation sites. Our proposed KbhbXG model first utilizes machine learning algorithm XGBoost to predict β-hydroxybutyrylation modification sites. On the independent test set, KbhbXG achieves an accuracy of 0.7457, specificity of 0.7771, and an impressive area under the curve (AUC) score of 0.8172. The high AUC score achieved by our method demonstrates its potential for effectively identifying novel β-hydroxybutyrylation sites, thereby facilitating further research and exploration of the β-hydroxybutyrylation process. Also, functional analyses have revealed that different organisms preferentially engage in distinct biological processes and pathways, which can provide valuable insights for understanding the mechanism of β-hydroxybutyrylation and guide experimental verification.

These include central lymph node metastasis (CLNM), which affects the prognosis of PTMC patients. This study aimed to establish a predictive model combining ultrasonography and clinicopathological features to accurately evaluate latent CLNM in PTMC patients with HT at the clinical lymph node-negative (cN0) stage. In this study, 1102 PTMC patients who received thyroidectomy and central cervical lymph node dissection (CLND) from the First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University from January 2021 to December 2022 and the 960th Hospital of PLA from January 2021 to December 2022 were jointly collected. The clinical differences between PTMCs with HT and those without HT were compared. A total of 373 PTMCs with HT in cN0 were randomly divided into a training cohort and a validation cohort. By analyzing and screening the risk factors of CLNM, a nomogram model was established and verified. The predictive performance was measured by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and clinical decision curve analysis (DCA). The ratio of central lymph node metastasis (CLNMR) in PTMCs with HT was 0.0% (0.0%, 15.0%) and 7.7% (0.0%, 40.0%) in the non-HT group (P<0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that age, gender, calcification, adjacent to trachea or capsule, and TPOAB were predictors of CLNM in PTMCs with HT. The areas under the curve (AUC) of the prediction models in the training cohort and the validation cohort were 0.835 and 0.825, respectively, which showed good differentiation ability. DCA indicates that the prediction model also has high net benefit and clinical practical value. This study found that CLN involvement was significantly reduced in PTMC patients with HT, suggesting that different methods should be used to predict CLNM in PTMC patients with HT and without HT, to more accurately assist preoperative clinical evaluation. The actual CLNM situation of PTMCs with HT in cN0 can be accurately predicted by the combination of ultrasonography and clinicopathological features.","20240430","Frontiers in endocrinology","Department of Ultrasound, The First Affiliated Hospital of Shandong First Medical University and Shandong Provincial Qianfoshan Hospital, Jinan, Shandong, China."

The prevailing diagnostic standard involves the expeditious intraoperative pathological diagnosis of areas infiltrated by LADC. Nevertheless, current methodologies rely on the visual interpretation of tissue images by proficient pathologists, introducing an error margin of up to 15.6%. In this study, we investigated the utilization of Micro-Raman technique on isolated specimens of human LADC with the objective of formulating and validating a workflow for the pathological diagnosis of LADC featuring diverse degrees of infiltration. Our strategy encompasses a thorough pathological characterization of LADC, spanning different tissue types and levels of infiltration. Through the integration of Raman spectroscopy with advanced deep learning models for simultaneous diagnosis, this approach offers a swift, precise, and clinically relevant means of analysis. The diagnostic performance of the convolutional neural network (CNN) model, coupled with the microscopic Raman technique, was found to be exceptional and consistent, surpassing the traditional support vector machine (SVM) model. The CNN model exhibited an area under the curve (AUC) value of 96.1% for effectively distinguishing normal tissue from LADC and an impressive 99.0% for discerning varying degrees of infiltration in LADCs. To comprehensively assess its clinical utility, Raman datasets from patients with intraoperative rapid pathologic diagnostic errors were utilized as test subjects and input into the established CNN model. The results underscored the substantial corrective capacity of the Micro-Raman technique, revealing a misdiagnosis correction rate exceeding 96% in all cases. Ultimately, our discoveries highlight the Micro-Raman technique's potential to augment the intraoperative diagnostic precision of LADC with varying levels of infiltration. And compared to the traditional SVM model, the CNN model has better generalization ability in diagnosing different infiltration levels.

To date, few research studies have used ND to discriminate the risk of developing AD and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) from healthy controls (HC). In this work, two distinct cohorts with highly heterogeneous data, derived from the Australian Imaging Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) Flagship Study of Ageing project and the Fujian Medical University Union Hospital (FMUUH) China, were employed. An innovative framework with built-in easily interpretable ND models constructed solely on HC data was introduced along with proposing a strategy of distance to boundary (DtB) to detect MCI and AD.

To address these issues, this paper centers on the landslide disaster in Ji'an City, China, and proposes a heterogeneous ensemble learning method incorporating frequency ratio (FR) and semi-supervised sample expansion. Based on the superimposed results of 12 environmental factor frequency ratios (FFR), non-landslide samples were selected and input into light gradient boosting machine (LightGBM), random forest (RF), and convolutional neural network (CNN) models for prediction along with historical landslide samples. The predicted probability values are integrated by four heterogeneous ensemble strategies to expand samples from high-confidence results. The model's performance is evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), partition frequency ratio (PFR), and other verification methods. The results demonstrate that the negative sample based on FFR sampling is more accurate than the random sampling method, and the FR-SSELR model based on frequency ratio sampling and semi-supervised ensemble strategy exhibits the highest performance (AUC = 0.971, ACC = 0.941).

In this retrospective cohort study, we evaluated the diagnostic performance of proximal airway GM in diagnosis of IPA including COVID-19 associated pulmonary aspergillosis (CAPA). Between January 2022 and January 2023, patients who had been tested for GM with clinical suspicion or for surveillance from any specimen (serum, induced sputum, tracheal aspirate, and BALF) were screened.

Several bedside screening tests are employed for the early detection of dysphagia. Pulse oximetry emerges as a practical and supportive method to augment the existing techniques utilized during bedside swallowing assessments. Desaturation levels, as measured by pulse oximetry, are acknowledged as indicative of aspiration by certain screening tests. However, the predictive capability of pulse oximetry in determining aspiration remains a subject of controversy. The objective of this study was to compare aspiration and oxygen desaturation levels by time and aspiration severity in dysphagic patients compared to healthy controls. It also aimed to evaluate the accuracy of pulse oximetry by comparing it with VFSS findings in detecting aspiration in both liquid (IDDSI-0) and semi-solid (IDDSI-4) consistencies. Eighty subjects (40 healthy and 40 acute stroke patients) participated. Patients suspected of dysphagia underwent videofluoroscopy as part of the stroke unit's routine procedure. Baseline SpO2 was measured before VFSS, and stabilized values were recorded. Sequential IDDSI-0 and IDDSI-4 barium tests were conducted with 5 ml boluses. Stabilized SPO2 values were recorded during swallowing and 3-min post-feeding. Patients with non-dysphagia received equal bolus monitoring. Changes in SPO2 during, before, and after swallowing were analyzed for each consistency in both groups. The study revealed a statistically significant difference in SPO2 between patients with dysphagia and controls for IDDSI-4 and IDSSI-0. In IDDSI-4, 20% of patients experienced SpO2 decrease compared to 2.5% in control group (p = 0.013). For IDDSI-0, 35% of patients showed SpO2 decrease, while none in the control group did (p = 0.0001). Aspiration rates were 2.5% in IDDSI-4 and 57.5% in IDDSI-0. In IDDSI-0, SpO2 decrease significantly correlated with aspiration (p = 0.0001). In IDDSI-4, 20.5% had SpO2 decrease without aspiration, and showing no significant difference (p = 0.613). Penetration-Aspiration Scale scores had no significant association with SpO2 decrease (p = 0.602). Pulse oximetry in IDDSI-4 had limited sensitivity (0%) and positive predictive value, (0%) while in IDDSI-0, it demonstrated acceptable sensitivity (60.9%) and specificity (100%) with good discrimination capability (AUC = 0.83). A decrease in SPO2 may indicate potential aspiration but is insufficient alone for detection.
