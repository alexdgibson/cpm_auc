We retrospectively collected patients â‰¥18 years old who underwent LDLT for ALF between 2010 and 2020 at 35 centers in Asia. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the clinical variables related to short-term mortality and establish a novel scoring system. The Kaplan-Meier method was performed to explore the association between the score and overall survival. Of the 339 recipients, 46 (13.6%) died within 1 year after LDLT. Multivariate analyses revealed 4 independent risk factors for death: use of vasopressors or mechanical ventilation, the higher model for end-stage liver disease score, and a lower graft-to-recipient weight ratio. The internally validated c-statistic of the short-term mortality after transplant (SMT) score derived from these 4 variables was 0.80 (95% confidence interval: 0.74-0.87). The SMT score successfully stratified recipients into low-, intermediate-, and high-risk groups with 1-year overall survival rates of 96%, 80%, and 50%, respectively. In conclusion, our novel SMT score based on 4 predictors will guide ALF recipient and living donor selection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}","10.1016/j.ajt.2024.04.016",NA,NA,NA

However, the primary patency of AVF at one year is under 70% due to several risk factors and comorbidities. Leukocyte glucose index (LGI), a new biomarker based on blood leukocytes and glucose values, has been found to be associated with poor outcomes in cardiovascular disease. The aim of this study is to analyze the impact of LGI on the long-term primary patency of AVF following dialysis initiation. (2) Methods: We conducted a retrospective observational study in which we initially enrolled 158 patients with ESKD admitted to the Vascular Surgery Department of the Emergency County Hospital of Targu Mures, Romania, to surgically create an AVF for dialysis between January 2020 and July 2023. The primary endpoint was AVF failure, defined as the impossibility of performing a chronic dialysis session due to severe restenosis or AVF thrombosis. After follow-up, we categorized patients into two groups based on their AVF status: ""functional AVF"" for those with a permeable AVF and ""AVF failure"" for those with vascular access dysfunction. (3) Results: Patients with AVF failure had a higher prevalence of atrial fibrillation (p = 0.013) and diabetes (p = 0.028), as well as a higher LGI value (1.12 vs. 0.79, p < 0.001). At ROC analysis, LGI had the strongest association with the outcome, with an AUC of 0.729, and an optimal cut-off value of 0.95 (72.4% sensitivity and 68% specificity). In Kaplan-Meier survival analyses, patients in the highest tertile (T3) of LGI had a significantly higher incidence of AVF failure compared to those in tertile 1 (p = 0.019). Moreover, we found that patients with higher baseline LGI values had a significantly higher risk of AVF failure during follow-up (HR: 1.48, p = 0.003). The association is independent of age and sex (HR: 1.65, p = 0.001), cardiovascular risk factors (HR: 1.63, p = 0.012), and pre-operative vascular mapping determinations (HR: 3.49, p = 0.037). (4) Conclusions: In conclusion, high preoperative values of LGI are positively associated with long-term AVF failure. The prognostic role of the biomarker was independent of age, sex, cardiovascular risk factors, and pre-operative vascular mapping determinations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}","10.3390/jcm13072037",NA,NA,NA

There is increasing evidence that platelets play a crucial role not only in hemostasis but also in inflammation and innate immunity. In this study, we explored the relationship between platelet count, clinical characteristics, and the prognosis of patients with AAV. We divided 187 patients into two groups based on their platelet count. Clinicopathological data and prognostic information were retrospectively gathered from medical records. Univariate and multivariate regression analyses were used to identify risk factors for prognosis, including end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and mortality. The cutoff point for platelet count was set at 264.5â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L, as determined by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for predicting progression to ESRD in patients with AAV. We observed patients with low platelet count (plateletsâ€‰<â€‰264.5â€‰Ã—â€‰109/L) had lower leukocytes, hemoglobin, complement, acute reactants, and worse renal function (P for eGFRâ€‰<â€‰0.001).

Low platelet count was potentially an independent predictor of poor renal prognosis in the multivariate regression analysis [HR 1.670 (95% CI 1.019-2.515), Pâ€‰=â€‰0.014]. Lower platelet count at diagnosis is associated with more severe clinical characteristics and impaired renal function.

However, its role in predicting early mortality in pulmonary embolism (PE) remains unexplored. This observational, prospective, single-center study enrolled consecutive patients aged 18 or older with confirmed acute symptomatic PE and no prior anticoagulation. The study aims to assess the prognostic capacity of sP-selectin measured at the time of PE diagnosis for short-term mortality and major bleeding. A total of 196 patients, with a mean age of 69.1â€‰years (SD 17), were included, of whom 52.6% were male. Within 30â€‰days, 9.7% of patients (nâ€‰=â€‰19) died, and 5.1% (nâ€‰=â€‰10) suffered major bleeding. PE risk stratification revealed 4.6% (nâ€‰=â€‰9) with high-risk PE, 34.7% (nâ€‰=â€‰68) with intermediate-high-risk PE, 38.3% (nâ€‰=â€‰75) with intermediate-low-risk PE, and 22.5% (nâ€‰=â€‰44) with low-risk PE according to the European Society of Cardiology score.

Data from 110 patients who underwent CPA tumor resection with intraoperative FCoMEPs and BR monitoring were retrospectively reviewed. The association between the amplitude reduction ratios of FCoMEPs and BR at the end of surgery and postoperative facial nerve function was determined. Subsequently, the optimal threshold of FCoMEPs and BR for predicting postoperative facial nerve dysfunction were determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Valid BR was record in 103 of 110 patients, whereas only 43 patients successfully recorded FCoMEP in orbicularis oculi muscle. A reduction over 50.3% in FCoMEP (O. oris) amplitude was identified as a predictor of postoperative facial nerve dysfunction (sensitivity, 77.1%; specificity, 83.6%). BR was another independent predictor of postoperative facial nerve deficit with excellent predictive performance, especially eyelid closure function. Its optimal cut-off value for predicting long-term postoperative eyelid closure dysfunction was was 51.0% (sensitivity, 94.4%; specificity, 94.4%). BR can compensate for the deficiencies of the FCoMEPs. The combination of BR and FCoMEPs can be used in CPA tumor surgery. The study first proposed an optimal cut-off value of BR amplitude deterioration (50.0%) for predicting postoperative eyelid closure deficits in patients undergoing CPA tumor surgery.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}","10.1016/j.clinph.2024.03.033",NA,NA,NA

The secondary aim is to determine the threshold MOCART score which predicts the ability to meet the PASS and the MCID for KOOS QoL. Patients undergoing ACI for grade IV patellofemoral chondral defects by a single surgeon from 2017 to 2020 were identified by search of the EMR. To determine PASS status, patients were asked, ""Do you consider your current level of symptoms to be acceptable?"" KOOS QoL scores were also collected. Patients with 6-month postoperative knee MRI, PASS scores, and minimum 2-year follow-up data were included. Paired t tests and Wilcoxon Rank-Sum tests were used to evaluate the relationship between MOCART scores and (1) PASS achievement and (2) achievement of the MCID for KOOS QoL (12.8). Thirty-four patients were included, with a median age of 35.1 years [IQR: 24.6, 37.1], and BMI of 24.0 kg/m2 [IQR: 21.5, 28.1]. The median time to postoperative MRI was 6.7 months [IQR: 5.8, 7.9], and average follow-up time was 3.7 Â± 1.2 years. Twenty-five patients (74%) achieved PASS, and 18 patients (out of 27 who had postop KOOS QoL Scores, 67%) achieved the MCID for KOOS QoL. Patients who achieved PASS had higher average MOCART scores (61.8 Â± 16.0) than those who did not achieve PASS (45.0 Â± 12.8, p=0.011), whereas patients who achieved the MCID for KOOS QoL did not have higher MOCART scores than those who did not achieve the MCID (61.9 Â± 18.3 versus 53.3 Â± 17.1, P = 0.25). There was no relationship between age, sex, lesion size, and lesion location and ability to achieve PASS or MCID for KOOS QoL (p>0.05). A threshold MOCART value of 55 was associated with the highest AUC on ROC analysis for likelihood of achieving PASS (0.778) and MCID for KOOS QoL (0.667). Higher MOCART scores are associated with an increased likelihood of achieving PASS following patellofemoral ACI. Moreover, MOCART scores > 55 predict the ability to achieve PASS and the MCID for KOOS QoL following patellofemoral ACI.

Initially, PMAC was considered a metastatic manifestation of other cancers; however, instances of non-metastatic PMAC have been documented through monitoring, epidemiological studies, and data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Therefore, it is crucial to investigate the epidemiological characteristics of PMAC and discern the prognostic differences between PMAC and the more prevalent pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). The study used data from the SEER database from 2000 to 2018 to identify patients diagnosed with PMAC or PDAC. To ensure comparable demographic characteristics between PDAC and PMAC, propensity score matching was employed. Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to analyse overall survival (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS). Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to determine independent risk factors influencing OS and CSS. Additionally, the construction and validation of risk-scoring models for OS and CSS were achieved through the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator-Cox regression technique. The SEER database included 84,857 patients with PDAC and 3345 patients with PMAC. Notably, significant distinctions were observed in the distribution of tumour sites, diagnosis time, use of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, tumour size, grading, and staging between the two groups. The prognosis exhibited notable improvement among married individuals, those receiving acceptable chemotherapy, and those with focal PMAC (pÂ <Â 0.05). Conversely, patients with elevated log odds of positive lymph node scores or higher pathological grades in the pancreatic tail exhibited a more unfavourable prognosis (pÂ <Â 0.05). The risk-scoring models for OS or CSS based on prognostic factors indicated a significantly lower prognosis for high-risk patients compared to their low-risk counterparts (area under the curve OS: 0.81-0.82, CSS: 0.80-0.82). PMAC exhibits distinct clinical characteristics compared to non-specific PDAC. Leveraging these features and pathological classifications allows for accurate prognostication of PMAC or PDAC.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}","10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30268",NA,NA,NA

Consecutive patients with recurrent atrial fibrillation (AF) or atrial tachycardia (AT), who were scheduled for repeat LA ablation, were enrolled in the prospective Bernau ablation registry between 2016 and 2020. All patients received a complete LA ultrahigh-density map before ablation. Maps were analyzed for LA size, LVA percentage and distribution. The predictive value of demographic, anatomic, and mapping variables on AF recurrence was analyzed. 160 patients (50.6% male, 1.3 pre-ablations, 60% persistent AF) with complete LA voltage maps were included.

Homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) is a widely used surrogate measure of insulin resistance. The triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index is another validated measure of insulin resistance that predicts both diabetes and cardiovascular disease in low and medium-income countries, but only diabetes in high income countries. Due to the paucity of data on the TyG index in the US population, we compared the validity of the TyG index and HOMA-IR in predicting MetS. Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) between 2005 and 2018 on Non-Hispanic White (NHW), Hispanic American (HA), and African American (AA) individuals (n = 5380) aged 20-80 years were used for analysis. Individuals were classified as having MetS based on three or more of its components. HOMA-IR and the TyG index were determined from fasting samples. Both the TyG index and HOMA-IR were significantly increased in MetS and increased significantly with increasing severity of the syndrome. Also both indices correlated significantly with all 5 features of MetS, hsCRP and non-HDL-C. ROC-AUC analysis for TyG index was significantly greater than that of HOMA-IR in predicting MetS: 0.87 (95 % CI 0.85-0.88) versus 0.82 (95 % CI 0.81-0.83) respectively, p < 0.0001.

Low-risk is defined as grade I or II DCIS. Because DCIS grade is a major eligibility criteria in these trials, it would be very helpful to assess DCIS grade on mammography, informed by grade assessed on DCIS histopathology in pre-surgery biopsies, since surgery will not be performed on a significant number of patients participating in these trials. To assess the performance and clinical utility of a convolutional neural network (CNN) in discriminating high-risk (grade III) DCIS and/or Invasive Breast Cancer (IBC) from low-risk (grade I/II) DCIS based on mammographic features. We explored whether the CNN could be used as a decision support tool, from excluding high-risk patients for active surveillance. In this single centre retrospective study, 464 patients diagnosed with DCIS based on pre-surgery biopsy between 2000 and 2014 were included. The collection of mammography images was partitioned on a patient-level into two subsets, one for training containing 80% of cases (371 cases, 681 images) and 20% (93 cases, 173 images) for testing.

Classification performance was assessed with the Area Under the Curve (AUC) receiver operating characteristic and predictive values on the test set for predicting high risk DCIS-and high-risk DCIS and/ or IBC from low-risk DCIS. When classifying DCIS as high-risk, the deep learning network achieved a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 0.40, Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 0.91 and an AUC of 0.72 on the test dataset. For distinguishing high-risk and/or upstaged DCIS (occult invasive breast cancer) from low-risk DCIS a PPV of 0.80, a NPV of 0.84 and an AUC of 0.76 were achieved. For both scenarios (DCIS grade I/II vs. III, DCIS grade I/II vs. III and/or IBC) AUCs were high, 0.72 and 0.76, respectively, concluding that our convolutional neural network can discriminate low-grade from high-grade DCIS.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}","10.1186/s40644-024-00691-x",NA,NA,NA

The application value of different screening tools was summarized in the nutritional screening of patients with liver cirrhosis. In this study, LDUST, RFH-NPT, and NRS2002 were used by nurses to screen the nutritional status of hospitalized patients with liver cirrhosis within 24-48Â h after admission. The study calculated validity indicators such as sensitivity, specificity, the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), and reliability indicators such as the Kappa coefficient. The efficacy of these screening tools in the nutritional screening of patients with liver cirrhosis was compared. Among the 207 patients, LDUST and NRS2002 identified 72.9Â % and 23.7Â % as undernourished, respectively. The sensitivity of LDUST and NRS2002 were 92.1Â % and 30.0Â %, respectively. The Kappa value of LDUST and RFH-NPT was 0.620, and the Kappa value of LDUST compared with NRS2002 was 0.144. This study shows that the Liver Disease Undernutrition Screening Tool, a special screening tool for patients with liver cirrhosis, has a more reliable screening effect and higher sensitivity than NRS2002. The Liver Disease Undernutrition Screening Tool is recommended for nutritional screening in patients with liver cirrhosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}","10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e30339",NA,NA,NA

This study included patients with spinal disease from two hospitals between January 2021 and June 2023. The patients were divided into the training and validation sets, which were categorized as postoperative pneumonia (POP) or non-POP, respectively. This study identified the independent risk variables for POP using a multivariate logistic regression analysis. A nomogram prediction model was developed and validated using risk factors, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) to assess predictive performance. Following exclusion, 2223 patients from Changzheng Hospital were enrolled in the training set and 357 patients from the No. 905 Hospital of PLA Navy were enrolled in the validation set. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses revealed that operation time, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) grade, smoking, non-wearing of medical masks, lack of preoperative respiratory training, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), underlying diseases, and spinal section were risk factors for POP development in patients with spinal diseases. The area under the ROC curve of the training set was 0.950, whereas that of the validation set was 0.879. The model calibration curves demonstrated good agreement, and the DCA indicated a high expected net benefit value. The POP risk prediction model has high accuracy and efficiency in predicting POP in patients with spinal diseases. POP development is influenced by factors such as operation length, ASA grade, smoking, non-wearing of medical masks, lack of preoperative respiratory training, COPD, underlying diseases, and lumbar surgery.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}","10.1016/j.heliyon.2024.e29845",NA,NA,NA

To determine whether PROMs, as measured by the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI), would change significantly after 2-months postoperatively after lumbar decompression surgery for disc herniation or spinal stenosis. Retrospective analysis of prospectively and consecutively enrolled patients undergoing lumbar decompression surgery between 2020 and 2021 from a single surgeon spine registry. One hundred sixty-nine patients. ODI, achievement of minimum clinically important difference (MCID), revisions. Patients without a preoperative baseline score were excluded. Completion of the ODI questionnaire was assessed at the follow-up points. The median ODI was compared at time baseline, 2-month, 1-year and 2-year follow-up. Risk of reoperation was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis to identify at-risk ODI thresholds of requiring reoperation. Median ODI significantly improved at all time points compared to baseline (median baseline ODI: 40; 2-month ODI: 16, p=.001; 1-year ODI: 11.1, p=.001; 2-year ODI: 8, p=.001). Posthoc analysis demonstrated no difference between 2-months, 1-year and 2-year postoperative ODI (p=.9, p=.468, p=.606). The MCID was met in 87.9% of patients at 2 months, 80.7% at 1 year, and 87.3% at 2 years postoperatively. Twelve patients (7.7%) underwent revision surgery between 2 months and 2 years after the index surgery (median time to revision: 5.6 months). ROC curve analysis demonstrated that an ODI score â‰¥24 points at 2-months yielded a sensitivity of 85.7% and a specificity of 71.8% for predicting revision after lumbar decompression (AUC=0.758; 95% CI: 0.613-0.903). The Youden optimal threshold value of â‰¥24 points at 2-month postop ODI yielded an odd ratio (OR) for revision of 15.3 (CI: 1.8-131.8; p=.004). The positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were 15.4% and 98.8%, respectively. Two-year clinical follow-up may not be necessary for future peer-reviewed lumbar decompression surgery studies given that ODI plateaus at 8 weeks. Patients with a score â‰¥24 points at 2-months postoperatively have a higher risk of requiring a second surgery within the first 2 years and warrant continued follow-up.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}","10.1016/j.spinee.2024.03.018",NA,NA,NA

However, the current availability of non-invasive biomarkers for NAFLD remains limited. Therefore, further investigation is needed to identify and develop non-invasive biomarkers for NAFLD. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 11,883 patients admitted to the Healthcare Center, Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, from January 2016 to December 2019 and divided into NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups. Anthropometric and laboratory examination data were collected. The correlations between variables and NAFLD were evaluated using the student's t-test or Mann-Whitney U test and binary logistic regression analysis. The predictive ability of these variables for NAFLD was assessed using the areas under the curves (AUCs) of receiver operating characteristics. Among the included patients, 3,872 (32.58%) were diagnosed with NAFLD, with 386 (9.97%) individuals having liver fibrosis. Patients with NAFLD exhibited a higher proportion of males, elevated body mass index (BMI), and increased likelihood of hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and atherosclerosis. Logistic regression analysis identified the neutrophil to albumin ratio (NAR) as the most promising novel inflammation biomarkers, with the highest AUC value of 0.701, a cut-off value of 0.797, sensitivity of 69.40%, and specificity of 66.00% in identifying the risk of NAFLD. Moreover, NAR demonstrated superior predictive value in identifying NAFLD patients at risk of liver fibrosis, with an AUC value of 0.795, sensitivity of 71.30%, and specificity of 73.60% when NAR reached 1.285. These findings highlight that the novel inflammatory biomarker, NAR, is a convenient and easily accessible non-invasive predictor for NAFLD and NAFLD with liver fibrosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""Alexander""=>""Included""}","10.3389/fnut.2024.1368459",NA,NA,NA

Two hundred four patients with pathologically proven iCCA who underwent curative-intent resection and lymphadenectomy (training cohort: Nâ€‰=â€‰107, internal test cohort: Nâ€‰=â€‰46, and external test cohort: Nâ€‰=â€‰51). T1- and T2-weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and DCE imaging at 1.5â€‰T or 3.0â€‰T. Radiomics features were extracted from intra- and peri-tumoral regions on preoperative DCE-MR images. Imaging features were evaluated by three radiologists, and significant variables in univariable and multivariable regression analysis were included in clinical model. The best-performing radiomics signature and clinical characteristics (intrahepatic duct dilatation, MRI-reported LNM) were combined to build a nomogram.

Multi-institutional data (NÂ =Â 58) of PCa patients who underwent pre-treatment 3-T MRI prior to RP were included in this retrospective study. Radiomic and pathomic features were extracted from PCa regions on MRI and RP specimens delineated by expert clinicians. On training set (D1, NÂ =Â 44), Cox Proportional-Hazards models MR, MP and MRaP were trained using radiomics, pathomics, and their combination, respectively, to prognosticate rising PSA (PSA > 0.03Â ng/mL). Top features from MRaP were used to train a model to predict EPE on D1 and test on external dataset (D2, NÂ =Â 14). C-index, Kalplan-Meier curves were used for survival analysis, and area under ROC (AUC) was used for EPE. MRaP was compared with the existing post-treatment risk-calculator, CAPRA (MC). Patients had median follow-up of 34 months. MRaP (c-indexÂ =Â 0.685Â Â±Â 0.05) significantly outperformed MR (c-indexÂ =Â 0.646Â Â±Â 0.05), MP (c-indexÂ =Â 0.631Â Â±Â 0.06) and MC (c-indexÂ =Â 0.601Â Â±Â 0.071) (pÂ <Â 0.0001).
