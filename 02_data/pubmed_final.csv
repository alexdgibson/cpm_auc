1,"39963665","The association between eight complete blood count-derived inflammatory markers and muscle health.","Most studies have evaluated sarcopenia and muscle health solely based on muscle mass. This study comprehensively examined the associations between eight inflammatory indicators and muscle mass and strength, with the aim of identifying an indicator capable of evaluating muscle health across multiple dimensions. This study included 10,440 participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES, 2011-2018) and 5,384 participants from NHANES (2011-2014). Multivariate logistic regression, smooth curve fitting, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, subgroup analysis, and Spearman's correlation were used to comprehensively assess the associations between the eight inflammatory indicators and muscle mass and strength. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to compare the predictive abilities of the different indices for low muscle mass and muscle strength. Additionally, NHANES data were cross-validated with data from 554 patients at our hospital to evaluate the ability of the systemic immune inflammatory index (SII) to distinguish between low muscle mass and strength. After controlling for all potential confounding factors, multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that apart from the platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), and derived NLR (dNLR), the neutrophil-to-monocyte-plus-lymphocyte ratio (NMLR), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), SII, systemic inflammation response index (SIRI), and pan-immune-inflammation value (PIV) were significantly negatively correlated with muscle mass and strength. However, NMLR and NLR were significantly associated with changes in muscle mass only in Q4 (P < 0.05). In the stratified analysis by body mass index (BMI), only the SII, NLR, and NMLR were unaffected by BMI. In the cross-validation, the predictive performance of the SII for low muscle mass [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.699, 0.677, and 0.685] and low muscle strength (AUC = 0.857, 0.849, and 0.840) demonstrated a good reference value. RCS and smooth curve fitting analyses indicated that most inflammatory markers were linearly correlated with muscle health (P < 0.05). Compared with other inflammatory markers (e.g., PIV and dNLR), the SII demonstrated a more robust predictive ability, was less influence by covariates, and exhibited high generalization performance in internal and external validation. SII may be crucial in identifying ""hidden sarcopenia"" and the early stages of muscle functional decline.","2025","Frontiers in nutrition"
2,"39963283","Association of body roundness index with cardiovascular disease in patients with cardiometabolic syndrome: a cross-sectional study based on NHANES 2009-2018.","Cardiometabolic syndrome (CMS), marked by abdominal obesity and metabolic dysregulation, is associated with a heightened risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Compared to the traditional anthropometric predictors represented by body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC), body roundness index (BRI) appears to provide a more accurate reflection of the abdominal fat distribution associated with metabolic diseases. Therefore, this study intends to investigate the association of BRI with the risk of CVD and its components including congestive heart failure (CHF), coronary heart disease (CHD), angina, heart attack, and stroke in patients with CMS. At the same time, we hypothesized that BRI would identify CVD better than BMI or WC. Data from the 2009-2018 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Logistic regression models were mainly utilized to evaluate the relationship between BRI and CVD in patients with CMS, including smooth curve analysis, threshold effects analysis, subgroup analysis and multiple imputation. In addition, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess the ability of BRI to predict CVD. The logistic regression model showed a positive association between the BRI and CVD. The highest quartile of BRI (Q4) showing the strongest association with CVD. The smoothed curve revealed a linear relationship between BRI and CVD, but a U-shaped association between the BRI and CHF. For CVD, stratified analyses did not show significant difference between strata. For CHF, BMI interacted with the association, with BRI being associated with decreased risk of CHF in a subgroup of normal weight subjects and increased risk of CHF in a subgroup of obese subjects. The multiple imputation further confirmed the robustness of these results. Additionally, the ROC curve indicated that BRI, BMI and WC had predictive power for CVD and CHF (AUC > 0.05). BRI has similar predictive power to WC but better than BMI. An elevated BRI is associated with a heightened risk of CVD in patients with CMS. BRI has similar ability to predict CVD and CHF as WC, but superior to BMI.","2025","Frontiers in endocrinology"

Epidemiologic data have suggested the correlation between EMs and recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL), but the pathological mechanism is unclear. This study aims to investigate the potential biomarkers and immune infiltration in EMs and RPL, providing a basis for early detection and treatment of the two diseases. Two RPL and six EMs transcriptomic datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database were used for differential analysis via limma package, followed by weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) for key modules screening. Protein-protein interaction (PPI) network and two machine learning algorithms were applied to identify the common core genes in both diseases. The diagnostic capabilities of the core genes were assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Moreover, immune cell infiltration was estimated using CIBERSORTx, and the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was employed to elucidate the role of key genes in endometrial carcinoma (EC). 26 common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened in both diseases, three of which were identified as common core genes (MAN2A1, PAPSS1, RIBC2) through the combination of WGCNA, PPI network, and machine learning-based feature selection. The area under the curve (AUC) values generated by the ROC indicates excellent diagnostic powers in both EMs and RPL. The key genes were found to be significantly associated with the infiltration of several immune cells. Interestingly, MAN2A1 and RIBC2 may play a predominant role in the development and prognostic stratification of EC. We identified three key genes linking EMs and RPL, emphasizing the heterogeneity of immune infiltration in the occurrence of both diseases. These findings may provide new mechanistic insights or therapeutic targets for further research of EMs and RPL.","2025","Frontiers in molecular biosciences"

The study employed a cross-sectional design encompassing a 4-year period from 2020 to 2024. Fundus photographs from 320 individuals (2020-2024) were categorized into non-diabetes, pre-diabetes, type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) without DR, and T2DM with mild-to-moderate non-proliferative DR (NPDR) groups. An artificial intelligence (AI)-based automatic measurement system was used to quantify retinal blood vessels in the fundus color photographic images, enabling inter-group parameter comparison and analysis of significant differences. Between January 2020 and June 2024, fundus color photographs were collected from 320 individuals and categorized into four groups: non-diabetes (n = 54), pre-diabetes (n = 71), T2DM without overt DR (n = 144), and T2DM with mild-to-moderate NPDR (n = 51). In pairwise comparisons among individuals with pre-diabetes, T2DM without DR, and T2DM with mild-to-moderate NPDR. Fasting blood glucose (FBG), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were significantly different (P < 0.05). Within the T2DM population, FBG, HbA1c, age, SBP, and DBP were significant predictors for mild-to-moderate NPDR (P < 0.05). Average venous branching number (branch_avg_v) was significantly different among pre-diabetes, T2DM without DR, and T2DM with mild-to-moderate NPDR groups. In patients with T2DM with mild-to-moderate NPDR, Average length of arteries (length_avg_a) and average length of veins (length_avg_v) increased, whereas branch_avg_v, average venous branching angle (angle_avg_v), average venous branching asymmetry (asymmetry_avg_v),overall length density (vessel_length_density), and vessel area density (vessel_density) decreased significantly (P < 0.05). Logistic regression analysis identified length_avg_a, branch_avg_v, angle_avg_v, asymmetry_avg_v, vessel_length_density, and vessel_density as independent predictors of mild-to-moderate NPDR in patients with T2DM. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that length_avg_a, length_avg_v, branch_avg_v, angle_avg_v, asymmetry_avg_v, vessel_length_density, and vessel_density had diagnostic value for mild-to-moderate NPDR (P < 0.05). In individuals diagnosed with T2DM, specific retinal vascular parameters, such as branch_avg_v and vessel_density, demonstrate a significant correlation with mild-to-moderate NPDR. These parameters hold promise as preclinical biomarkers for detecting vascular abnormalities associated with DR.","2025","Frontiers in cell and developmental biology"
5,"39959754","Association Between Dietary Inflammatory Index and Triglyceride Glucose-Body Mass Index with Iron Deficiency in Reproductive Age Women: Evidence from NHANES 2005-2018.","There is a growing focus on the role of dietary factors and metabolic conditions in the evolution and progression of iron deficiency (ID), yet few studies have examined the underlying mechanisms. Dietary Inflammatory Index (DII) is a metric that gauges the inflammatory potential of an overall diet. This study explores the association between DII and triglyceride glucose-body mass index (TyG-BMI) with ID in reproductive-age women. This analysis utilized data from 2311 reproductive-age women in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) from 2005 to 2018. ID was identified using serum ferritin and transferrin receptor (TfR). The association between DII, TyG-BMI and ID was assessed using weighted logistic regression, linear regression and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models, with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for diagnostic power. Mediation effects of TyG-BMI were further explored by causal mediation analysis. Among reproductive-age women, both DII and TyG-BMI were significantly positively associated with ID (DII: OR = 1.32, 95% CI 1.19, 1.48; TyG-BMI: OR = 1.13, 95% CI 1.02, 1.35). There is a close relationship between the DII index and TfR (β= 1.17, 95% CI 1.03, 1.13). RCS analysis indicated that the relationships were mostly linear (P-overall < 0.05, P-nonlinear > 0.05). Furthermore, TyG-BMI mediated 5.19%, 12.83%, and 5.63% of the associations between DII and ID, Ferritin, and transferrin receptor (TfR), respectively. The findings suggest that targeted interventions to enhance dietary practices, nutritional intake, and overall metabolic well-being may result in substantial amelioration of ID among reproductive women.","2025","International journal of women's health"
6,"39959621","Correlation between liver fibrosis in non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and insulin resistance indicators: a cross-sectional study from NHANES 2017-2020.","Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a leading cause of chronic liver disease worldwide, with liver fibrosis (LF) being a crucial pathological feature in the progression of NAFLD. Insulin resistance (IR) is believed to play an important role in the pathogenesis of NAFLD and the development of LF. This study aims to explore the relationship between various IR indicators and LF in patients with NAFLD. This study utilized data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2017-2020 cycles. Liver steatosis and fibrosis were assessed using liver ultrasound transient elastography. To assess the association between multiple IR indicators and LF, the study methodology included univariate and multivariate logistic regression, as well as restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis. Subsequently, we used multivariate logistic regression to develop and validate a predictive model for LF, and evaluated the model's performance using the area under the curve (AUC) and calibration curve. A total of 904 patients were included in the final analysis. Among these NAFLD patients, 153 (16.92%) had LF. Compared to non-LF patients, LF patients had significantly higher body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), HbA1c, and fasting blood glucose (FBG) levels (all p < 0.05). Analysis of IR indicators showed that LF patients had significantly higher levels of TyG, TyG-WHtR, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, TyG-GGT, METS-IR, and HOMA-IR (all p < 0.05). After adjusting for covariates, TyG-WHtR remained an independent risk factor (OR=2.69; 95% CI: 2.08-3.47), indicating a strong correlation with LF. The developed nomogram, incorporating AST, TyG, TyG-BMI, and diabetes, showed an AUC of 0.809 (95% CI: 0.771-0.847), indicating good predictive performance for LF in NAFLD patients. This study confirms that a significant association between various IR and LF in NAFLD patients, and the developed nomogram provides a practical tool for early risk assessment. These findings underscore the clinical value of incorporating IR indices into routine practice to identify high-risk patients, enabling timely interventions to prevent fibrosis progression and improve outcomes.","2025","Frontiers in endocrinology"
7,"39959618","Association between the body roundness index and female infertility: a cross-sectional study from NHANES.","Infertility is strongly associated with obesity. The body roundness index (BRI) is a more accurate assessment of visceral fat content than the body mass index (BMI). However, current evidence on the association between visceral fat accumulation and infertility remains insufficient and controversial. Therefore, we utilized the 2017-2020 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database to explore the correlation between BRI and infertility. We used multiple logistic regression, smoothed curve fitting, subgroup analyses, and interaction tests to investigate the potential association between BRI and infertility. Additionally, we assessed the ability of BRI and BMI to predict infertility risk using receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis and calculate the area under the curve (AUC),sensitivity, and specificity. In the study, 1463 women aged 20 to 45 participated, and 172 of them were found to be infertile. After adjusting for all factors except body measurements, the findings indicated that for each one-unit increase in BRI, there was a 19% increase in the risk of infertility (OR = 1.19, 95% CI 1.05, 1.34). The analysis also revealed a positive nonlinear relationship between BRI and infertility. Furthermore, based on the ROC curves, it was observed that BRI was a more reliable predictor of infertility risk compared to BMI (BRI AUC = 0.5773, BMI AUC = 0.5681). This study demonstrated a positive association between higher BRI values and infertility among adult women in the United States and showed a stronger association than BMI.","2025","Frontiers in endocrinology"

We assessed the performance of a fully automated plasma p-tau217 immunoassay to detect Aβ pathology in mild cognitive impairment (MCI)/mild dementia. Paired plasma and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples were obtained at time of diagnostic lumbar puncture (LP) in a specialist memory service. Plasma p-tau217 was measured using the Lumipulse immunoassay platform and ability to detect CSF-defined Aβ positivity assessed. Of 148 participants (69.4 ± 6.5 years; 54.1% female), 101 had MCI and 47 mild dementia. Median plasma p-tau217 was > 4-fold higher in Aβ+ vs Aβ- individuals with an area under the curve of 0.92 (0.87-0.97). Application of 90%, 95%, and 97.5% sensitivity/specificity thresholds for plasma p-tau217 may have obviated the need for more than half of LPs. Our real-world data support the clinical use of fully automated plasma p-tau217 immunoassays, although further studies in more diverse cohorts are required.

Using LEDs as the light sources, the device contains a driving motor that rotates a pair of orthogonally oriented linear polarizers. By performing lock-in processing to frames taken under the rotating crossed polarization imaging (RXPI) system, the AC components of the periodic intensity signal of chicken tissues are acquired and compared. With an area under the curve (AUC) of 93%, the chicken sciatic nerve is distinct for automatic identification. In both chicken thigh and cadaver arm models, the contrasts of nerve tissues are successfully enhanced in the lock-in processed output image. Real-time automatic nerve masking is successfully demonstrated in the chicken model using a portable prototype weighing 525 g. In conclusion, the RXPI system with lock-in processing methods can potentially serve as an intraoperative nerve identification aid.","2025","Biomedical optics express"

A retrospective study was conducted from 1 January 2021, to 31 December 2023, at Wenzhou Central Hospital. Patients diagnosed with PTB and DM were included, with multidrug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) defined as resistance to at least rifampicin and isoniazid. Data on demographics, clinical symptoms, laboratory tests, and treatment history were collected. Multivariate logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for MDR, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed to evaluate the predictive value of these factors. A total of 318 patients were analyzed, with 253 in the non-MDR group and 65 in the MDR group. Significant independent predictors of MDR included a history of TB treatment, smoking, and elevated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels. ROC curve analysis showed that the combination of TB treatment history, smoking history, and HbA1c levels had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.809, with 64.62% sensitivity and 82.61% specificity. In patients without prior TB treatment, smoking history and HbA1c were identified as independent risk factors, with an AUC of 0.771 for their combination. For patients with prior TB treatment, place of residence and pulmonary cavity were independent predictors, with an AUC of 0.802 for their combination. This study highlights the importance of smoking history, HbA1c levels, place of residence, and pulmonary cavity as risk factors for MDR in PTB and DM patients. Early identification of these risk factors can aid in the timely diagnosis and treatment of MDR-TB, potentially reducing its burden. Further research is needed to develop targeted interventions based on these findings.","2025","Frontiers in medicine"

The aim of our study is to identify preoperative and intraoperative independent risk factors for AKI in patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery. Using these factors, we developed a risk prediction model for AKI after cardiac valve surgery and conducted external validation. Our retrospective study recruited 497 adult patients undergoing cardiac valve surgery as a derivation cohort between February and August 2023. Patient demographics, including medical history and perioperative clinical information, were acquired, and patients were classified into one of two cohorts, AKI and non-AKI, according to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) guidelines. Using binary logistic stepwise regression analysis, we identified independent AKI risk factors after cardiac valve surgery. Lastly, we constructed a nomogram and conducted external validation in a validation cohort comprising 200 patients. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated based on the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). In the derivation cohort, 172 developed AKI (34.6%). Relative to non-AKI patients, the AKI patients exhibited elevated postoperative complication incidences and worse outcome. Based on multivariate analysis, advanced age (OR: 1.855; p = 0.011), preoperative hypertension (OR: 1.91; p = 0.017), coronary heart disease (OR: 6.773; p < 0.001), preoperative albumin (OR: 0.924; p = 0.015), D-Dimer (OR: 1.001; p = 0.038), plasma creatinine (OR: 1.025; p = 0.001), cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) duration (OR: 1.011; p = 0.001), repeat CPB (OR: 6.195; p = 0.010), intraoperative red blood cell transfusion (OR: 2.560; p < 0.001), urine volume (OR: 0.406 p < 0.001) and vasoactive-inotropic score (OR: 1.135; p = 0.009) were independent risk factors for AKI. The AUC of the nomogram in the derivation and validation cohorts were 0.814 (95%CI: 0.775-0.854) and 0.798 (95%CI: 0.726-0.871), respectively. Furthermore, the calibration curve revealed that the predicted outcome was in agreement with the actual observations. Finally, the DCA curves showed that the nomogram had a good clinical applicability value. Several perioperative factors modulate AKI development following cardiac valve surgery, resulting in poor patient prognosis. The proposed AKI predictive model is both sensitive and precise, and can assist in high-risk patient screening in the clinics.","2025","Frontiers in medicine"
12,"39958729","Predicting positive Clostridioides difficile test results using large-scale longitudinal data of demographics and medication history.","Clostridioides difficile infection is a major health threat. Healthcare institutions have strong medical and financial incentives to keep infections under control. Blanket testing at admission is in general not recommended, and current predictive models either used moderate sample sizes, over-inflated the number of covariates, or chose non-interpretable algorithms. We aim to develop models using patient data to predict positive Clostridioides difficile test results with discrimination performance, interpretable results, and a reasonable number of covariates that reflect health over a long-time span. We processed records from 157,493 University of California San Diego Health patients seen between January 01, 2016-July 03, 2019 with at least 6 months of medication history, excluding pregnant women, patients under 18, and prisoners. Three models (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Ensemble) were constructed using hyper-parameters selected through 10-fold cross-validation. Model performance was measured by the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUROC). The model coefficients' odds ratios and p-values were calculated for the Logistic Regression model, as were Gini indices for Random Forest. Decision boundary analysis was conducted using pair-wise false positive and false negative cases each model would predict at a specific threshold. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Ensemble models yielded test AUROCs of 0.839, 0.851, and 0.866, respectively. Significant covariates that may affect risk include age, immuno-compromised treatments, past antibiotic uses, and some medications for the gastrointestinal tract. The models achieve high discrimination performance (AUROC >0.83). There is a general consensus among different analysis approaches regarding predictors that impact patients' chances of having a positive test, which may influence Clostridioides difficile risk, including features clinically proven to increase susceptibility. These human-interpretable models can help distinguish significant predictors that affect a patient's chance of testing positive, which may influence their Clostridioides difficile risk.","2025","Heliyon"

Technologies aimed at the early diagnosis of this condition, such as infrared thermography (IRT), can be used to generate large amounts of data that provide valuable information when analyzed using learning techniques. The objective of this study was to evaluate and optimize the use of machine learning by applying the Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) algorithm in the diagnosis of bovine SCM, based on udder thermogram analysis. Over 14 months, a total of 1035 milk samples were collected from 97 dairy cows subjected to an automatic milking system. Somatic cell counts were performed by flow cytometry, and the health status of the mammary gland was determined based on a cutoff of 200,000 cells/mL of milk. The attributes analyzed collectively included air temperature, relative humidity, temperature-humidity index, breed, body temperature, teat dirtiness score, parity, days in milk, mammary gland position, milk yield, electrical conductivity, milk fat, coldest and hottest points in the mammary gland region of interest, average mammary gland temperature, thermal amplitude, and the difference between the average temperature of the region of interest and the animal's body temperature, as well as the microbiological evaluation of the milk. Using the XGBoost algorithm, the most relevant variables for solving the classification problem were identified and selected to construct the final model with the best fit and performance. The best area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC: 0.843) and specificity (Sp: 93.3%) were obtained when using all thermographic variables. The coldest point in the region of interest was considered the most important for decision making in mastitis diagnosis. The use of XGBoost can enhance the diagnostic capability for SCM when IRT is employed. The developed optimized model can be used as a confirmatory mechanism for SCM.","2025","Veterinary medicine international"

Traditional risk prediction models have limitations, and deep learning (DL) algorithms offer potential improvements but often require large datasets. This study aimed to develop a DL-based, label-free lung cancer risk prediction model using alternative LDCT images and validate it in individuals without non-calcified solid pulmonary nodules larger than 8 mm. We utilized LDCT scans from individuals without non-calcified solid nodules larger than 8 mm to develop a DL-based lung cancer risk prediction model. An alternative training dataset included 1,064 LDCT scans: 380 from patients with pathologically confirmed lung cancer and 684 from control individuals without lung cancer development over 5 years. For the lung cancer group, only the contralateral lung (without the tumor) was analyzed to represent high-risk individuals without large nodules. The LDCT scans were randomly divided into training and validation sets in a 3:1 ratio. Four three-dimensional (3D) convolutional neural networks (CNNs; 3D-CNN, MobileNet v2, SEResNet18, EfficientNet-B0) were trained using densely connected U-Net (DenseUNet)-segmented lung parenchyma images. The models were validated on a real-world test dataset comprising 1,306 LDCT scans (1,254 low-risk and 52 high-risk individuals) and evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), Brier scores, and calibration measures. In the validation dataset, the AUC values were 0.801 for 3D-CNN, 0.802 for MobileNet v2, 0.755 for EfficientNet-B0, and 0.833 for SEResNet18. Corresponding Brier scores were 0.169, 0.175, 0.217, and 0.156, respectively, indicating good calibration, especially for SEResNet18. In the test dataset, the AUC values were 0.769 for 3D-CNN, 0.753 for MobileNet v2, 0.681 for EfficientNet-B0, and 0.820 for SEResNet18, with Brier scores of 0.169, 0.180, 0.202, and 0.138, respectively. The SEResNet18 model demonstrated the best performance, achieving the highest AUC and lowest Brier score in both validation and test datasets. Our study demonstrated that DL-based, label-free lung cancer risk prediction models using alternative LDCT images can effectively predict lung cancer development in individuals without non-calcified solid pulmonary nodules larger than 8 mm. By analyzing lung parenchyma on LDCT images without relying on nodule detection, these models may enhance the efficiency of LDCT screening programs. Further prospective studies are needed to determine their clinical utility and impact on screening protocols, and validation in larger, diverse populations is necessary to ensure generalizability.","2025","Translational lung cancer research"
15,"39958209","MS4A15 gene expression as a prognostic marker for clinical outcomes in lung adenocarcinoma.","Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is the predominant histological subtype of lung cancer. In the past decade, various targeted drugs have prolonged the survival of LUAD patients. Unfortunately, not all LUAD patients can benefit from the current target agents. Although the membrane spanning 4-domains A15 (MS4A15) gene has been implicated in the progression of various cancers, its role in LUAD remains understudied. This study aimed to evaluate the role and potential mechanism of MS4A15 in the progression of LUAD. The pan-cancer RNA sequencing and clinical data of LUAD patients, originally comprising data from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Genotypic Tissue Expression, were acquired from University of California Santa Cruz XENA (UCSC XENA). Additionally, the GSE116959 and GSE130779 data sets were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. The Differential Expression analysis of Sequencing data version 2 (DESeq2) package was used to identify the differentially expressed genes. The ClusteProfiler package was used to perform the Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes, and gene set enrichment analyses. An immune cell infiltration analysis was conducted using the gene set variation analysis (GSVA) package. The expression level of MS4A15 was analyzed by the Wilcoxon rank-sum test. A logistic regression analysis was conducted to examine the correlation between the clinical pathological factors of LUAD patients and the high-low dichotomy of MS4A15. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was employed to evaluate the effectiveness of MS4A15 as a biomarker for distinguishing LUAD patients from healthy individuals. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was conducted to examine the overall survival of LUAD patients based on MS4A15. All the bioinformatic results were obtained using R (version 3.6.2) package. Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) was performed to validate the messenger RNA transcription level in vitro. MS4A15 expression was significantly more decreased in the tumor tissues from the LUAD patients than the normal adjacent samples. MS4A15 expression was positively correlated with various immune cell types, notably including mast cells (MCs), dendritic cells, and macrophages. Specifically, MS4A15 was most positively associated with MCs. Lower expression levels of MS4A15 in LUAD patients were correlated with a poorer pathologic stage and poorer primary therapy outcomes. The area under the curve of the ROC curve for MS4A15 effectiveness was 0.863. MS4A15 was validated to be more lowly expressed in the tumor tissues samples than the normal tissues samples in both the GSE116959 and GSE130779 data sets. The expression of MS4A15 was also significantly lower in the in A549 cells than the normal human bronchial epithelia cells. Overall, MS4A15 emerged as a promising prognostic biomarker for LUAD and could serve as a potential target for the development of novel therapeutic interventions.","2025","Translational lung cancer research"
16,"39957766","The prognostic significance of malnutrition in older adult patients with acute ischemic stroke.","Malnutrition is associated with an unfavorable prognosis; however, malnutrition in hospitalized patients is frequently overlooked by clinicians. This highlights the importance of accurately assessing nutritional status and providing appropriate nutritional supplementation. The most appropriate nutritional assessment tool for predicting the short-term prognosis of older adult patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) was identified from five nutritional assessment tools, including the Prognostic Nutrition Index (PNI), the Hemoglobin, Albumin, Lymphocyte and Platelet (HALP) Score, the Naples Prognostic Score (NPS), the Geriatric Nutritional Risk Index (GNRI), and the Controlling Nutritional Status (CONUT) Score. A total of 585 older adult patients with Acute Ischemic Stroke (AIS) were retrospectively analyzed and divided into two groups according to the modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score. The first group, comprising 111 cases, was classified as having a poor prognosis (mRS score > 2), while the second group, consisting of 391 cases, was classified as having a good prognosis (mRS score ≤ 2). A total of five nutritional assessment tools, including PNI, HALP Score, NPS, GNRI, and CONUT, were employed to evaluate the nutritional status of older adult patients with AIS and for the analysis of the relationship between nutritional status and prognosis. The incremental value of five nutritional assessment tools in predicting patient prognosis was compared by means of the Integrated Discriminant Improvement Index (IDI) and the Net Reclassification Index (NRI). The efficacy of each nutritional assessment tool in forecasting the incidence of unfavorable outcomes in older adult patients with AIS within a one-year timeframe was evaluated by utilizing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision analysis curves. Comparative analyses were also conducted. Among the five nutritional assessment tools, the PNI (AUC: 0.619, 95% CI: 0.560-0.679, p < 0.001) and HALP score (AUC: 0.612, 95% CI: 0.552-0.672, p < 0.001) demonstrated a significantly greater area under the ROC curve (AUC) compared to the NPS (AUC: 0.597, 95% CI: 0.536-0.658, p = 0.002), CONUT score (AUC: 0.582, 95% CI: 0.520-0.644, p = 0.009), and GNRI (AUC: 0.590, 95% CI: 0.529-0.651, p < 0.001). When compared to BMI, PNI exhibited a more pronounced improvement in the integrated discrimination index (IDI: 0.0203, p = 0.0061). Similarly, the net reclassification index (NRI) also showed a significant improvement (NRI: 0.2422, p = 0.024), indicating the superior performance of PNI in risk stratification. Among the five types of nutritional assessment tools employed in this study, the PNI was the most effective at predicting a poor prognosis at one year in older adult patients with AIS.","2025","Frontiers in nutrition"

This preliminary study aims to externally validate a previously developed clinical prediction model for falls in community-dwelling older adults with COPD. This was a secondary analysis of a 12-month prospective cohort study. Older adults (≥60 years) with COPD, who reported a fall in the past year and/or had balance concerns, were tracked for 12-month future falls. Baseline predictors included 12-month history of ≥2 falls, total chronic conditions, and Timed Up and Go Dual-Task (TUG-DT) test scores. Model performance was assessed for discrimination (c-statistic), calibration (E:O, CITL, and calibration slope), and clinical value (decision curve analysis). The study included 89 participants (average age 73 ± 9 years; 83 females; FEV1%predicted = 47%). Of these, 35 (39%) reported ≥1 future fall, totaling 89 falls. The model demonstrated acceptable discrimination (c-statistic = 0.62, CI [0.51,0.72]), and calibration (E:O = 1, CITL = 0, and a calibration slope = 1). Decision curve analysis showed greater clinical value when using the prediction model compared to screening for fall history alone. A 12-month history of ≥2 falls, higher total chronic conditions, and worse TUG-DT test scores, predicts falls in community-dwelling older adults with COPD. Larger studies are needed before clinical application.","2025","Chronic respiratory disease"

This was a prospective, observational, monocentric study conducted from November 2021 to December 2023. Patients with ovarian cancer eligible for surgery were enrolled and classified into endometriosis-correlated ovarian carcinoma, endometriosis-incidental ovarian carcinoma, or ovarian carcinoma without endometriosis groups based on the presence or not of endometriosis and transitional lesions. Clinical, sonographic, surgical and pathological data and progression-free survival were recorded. Logistic regression models for accurate patient classification were developed from pre-surgical variables. Of the 170 patients included, 83 (48.82%) had ovarian carcinoma without endometriosis, 39 (22.94%) had endometriosis-incidental ovarian carcinoma, and 48 (28.24%) had endometriosis-correlated ovarian carcinoma. Patients with endometriosis-incidental ovarian carcinoma and endometriosis-correlated ovarian carcinoma were diagnosed at younger ages (p = .002) and had lower post-menopausal rates than patients with ovarian carcinoma without endometriosis (p = .011). Patients with endometriosis-correlated ovarian carcinoma had fewer pregnancies (p < .001) and higher CA-19.9 levels (p = .002) presented with unilateral and multilocular solid lesions than patients with ovarian carcinoma without endometriosis (p < .001). Patients with endometriosis-incidental ovarian carcinoma showed intermediate lesion morphology. Endometriosis-correlated ovarian carcinoma was mostly diagnosed at early Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stages (range; I-II) compared with endometriosis-incidental ovarian carcinoma and ovarian carcinoma without endometriosis (p < .001), had less extensive disease (p < .001), and a higher likelihood of complete cytoreduction (p = .035). Endometriosis-correlated ovarian carcinoma was more likely to include clear cell, endometrioid, and mesonephric-like adenocarcinomas, whereas serous histotype predominated in the other groups (p < .001). Logistic regression models accurately identified patients with endometriosis-correlated ovarian carcinoma vs patients with endometriosis-incidental ovarian carcinoma (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.926) and ovarian carcinoma without endometriosis (AUC = 0.968) but could not reliably differentiate endometriosis-incidental ovarian carcinoma from ovarian carcinoma without endometriosis (AUC = 0.668). The 2-year progression-free survival rates were 91% in endometriosis-incidental ovarian carcinoma, 80% in endometriosis-correlated ovarian carcinoma, and 59% in ovarian carcinoma without endometriosis (p = .024). Our study indicates that ovarian cancer associated with endometriosis consists of 2 clinical entities, with endometriosis-incidental ovarian carcinoma emerging as a bridging group between endometriosis-correlated ovarian carcinoma and ovarian carcinoma without endometriosis.","2025","International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society"

This study aims to explore the correlation between the red blood cell distribution width (RDW) to albumin ratio (RAR), a practical measure for assessing inflammation, and depression in the general population. In this population-based cross-sectional study, data from 28932 adults aged≥18 years old in the NHANES during the period of 1999-2018 were analyzed. To examine the correlation between RAR and depression, multivariate logistic regression analyses, subgroup analyses, restricted cubic spline analyses, and interaction tests were conducted. Furthermore, a mediation analysis was performed to elucidate the role of atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) in mediating the effect of RAR on depression. Multivariate logistic regression analyses and restricted cubic splines analysis indicated that RAR can exhibit a linearly correlation with depression (OR = 1.335; 95% CI: 1.222, 1.458). Subjects in RAR Q2, Q3, Q4 groups had an increased risk on depression as 22.8%, 22.9% and 51.9% than those in the Q1 group. This positive correlation was more pronounced in those with history of cancers. The ROC analysis indicated that the area under the curve (AUC) for RAR (AUC=0.593) was significantly greater than that for RDW and albumin individually. Mediation analysis indicated that AIP mediated 7.8% of the correlation of RAR with depression. The findings of this study indicated a significant linear positive correlation between RAR and the prevalence of depression, with AIP serving as a mediator.","2025","Frontiers in psychiatry"

The research subjects were 680 patients with type 2 diabetic nephropathy admitted to our hospital. The patients were included from May 2018 to August 2023. Patients with acute kidney injury were used as the merge group (n=50), and patients without unmerge group (n=630) was included. The prevalence and predisposing factors of acute kidney injury in diabetic nephropathy were analyzed, multivariate logistic regression were used to analyze the influencing factors of acute kidney injury in patients, and a nomogram risk prediction model was established based on risk factors for verification. Analysis of the factors of acute kidney injury in diabetic nephropathy found that severe infection was the main trigger, accounting for 40.00%, followed by nephrotoxic antibiotics and severe heart failure. The age, urine microalbumin-to-creatinine ratio (ACR), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), uric acid(UA), and cystatin C (CysC) levels of patients in the combined acute kidney injury group were significantly higher than those in the unmerge group (P<0.05), and the left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and epidermal growth factor receptor (eGFR) levels were significantly lower than those in the unmerge group (P<0.05). Age, ACR, and CysC levels are independent risk factors for acute kidney injury in diabetic nephropathy, and LVEF and eGFR are independent protective factors (P<0.05). The C-index of the nomogram risk prediction model in predicting acute kidney injury in diabetic nephropathy is 0.768 (95% CI: 0.663-0.806), and the calibration curve tends to the ideal curve; the prediction threshold is >0.18, and the nomogram risk prediction model provides a clinical net benefits, and clinical net benefits were higher than independent predictors. The establishment of a nomogram model for acute kidney injury in elderly patients with diabetic nephropathy based on age, ACR, CysC, LVEF, and eGFR has a good predictive effect, which can help doctors more accurately assess the patient's condition and provide a basis for formulating personalized treatment plans.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

Liquid biopsy emerges as a promising non-invasive technique for distinguishing between malignant and benign, as well as hyperfunctioning and non-functioning cases. Recent studies have highlighted the potential of microRNAs as circulating biomarkers; however, their clinical utility remains underexplored. This study aims to validate the diagnostic performance of selected circulating microRNAs, (miR-483-5p, miR-210, miR-335 and miR-22-3p), identified through microRNA profiling studies, as markers of malignancy or cortisol hypersecretion in a cohort of patients with ATs. We collected serum samples from 75 patients with ATs, including 50 cases of adrenocortical adenomas (ACA) and 25 cases of adrenocortical carcinomas (ACC), along with 15 controls. In the ACC subgroup, 16 samples were obtained preoperatively or upon detection of recurrence (active ACC group), while the remaining from disease-free patients with long-term follow-up. Among the 56 patients with ATs evaluated preoperatively (50 with ACAs and 6 with ACC), 26 had non-functioning tumors, 22 exhibited mild autonomous cortisol secretion, and 8 had Cushing syndrome. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was employed to analyze microRNA expression. Circulating levels of miR-483-5p and miR-210 were significantly elevated in patients with active ACC compared to both ACAs (p<0.001 and p=0.004, respectively) and controls (p=0.02 and p = 0.03, respectively). Notably, miR-483-5p serum levels were higher in patients with active ACC compared to disease-free ACC patients (p = 0.01). MiR-483-5p demonstrated the best diagnostic accuracy for distinguishing active ACC cases from ACAs, achieving a sensitivity of 81.3% and a specificity of 88%, and from disease-free ACC patients, reaching sensitivity of 81.3% and specificity of 89%. MiR-22-3p serum levels successfully differentiated patients with Cushing syndrome from those with non-functioning ATs (area under the curve=AUC=0.800, 95% CI: 0.653-0.953, p=0.01) and controls (AUC= 0.800, 95% CI: 0.610-0.990, p=0.02). Additionally, circulating miR-22-3p levels exhibited a significant correlation with traditional diagnostic tests for hypercortisolism. This study supports the potential of a liquid biopsy approach as an innovative method for diagnosing and monitoring patients with ATs, offering a complementary tool to existing diagnostic methods.","2025","Frontiers in endocrinology"

Between 2019 and 2023, 91 DVT patients with RIVCF implantation were prospectively recruited. CTV was performed for all patients. Based on the presence of RIVCF-trapped embolus at filter retrieval, patients were divided into the no-embolus group and the embolus group. The thrombus density ratio was compared between the two groups. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were used to identify the association between thrombus density ratio and RIVCF-trapped embolus. RIVCF-trapped embolus occurred in 55 patients (60 %). The thrombus density ratio was significantly higher in the embolus group than the no-embolus group (46.23 ± 0.1 % vs. 55 ± 0.08 %, p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis showed that a high thrombus density ratio was associated with thrombus detachment (OR = 2.36, 95 % CI: 1.29-4.29; p = 0.005). The AUC value of the logistic regression model combined with thrombus density ratio and D-dimer for predicting RIVCF-trapped embolus was 0.882 (p < 0.001), and the thrombus density ratio was 0.841 (95 % CI: 0.75-0.92; p < 0.001). CT-based high thrombus density ratio could predict RIVCF-trapped embolus in DVT patients, indicating that those patients require aggressive RIVCF placement.

A nomogram was constructed based on essential prognostic factors to predict the risk of disease progression in T4a PTC patients with RLN invasion. A total of 418/602 (69.4%) T4a PTC patients with RLN invasion underwent surgery, the 5-year PFS rate was 89.8%. The multivariable analyses showed that age ≥55 years, preoperative vocal cord paralysis (VCP), microvascular invasion, and the number of cervical lymph node metastases (CLNM) >10 were prognostic risk factors of PFS in T4a PTC patients with RLN invasion. Our nomogram provided good discrimination, with a C-index of 0.778 in the training set and 0.793 in the validation set. No statistical difference (P = .918) was found between PFS and the surgical methods of RLN. By following up on the patient's voice condition, the RLN function was restored in approximately 82.7% of patients after RLN separation.

The relationship between the DII and osteoporosis was evaluated using weighted multivariate logistic regression, and potential non-linear associations were explored through restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression. Subgroup analyses were conducted with stratified models, and the findings were depicted in a forest plot. To pinpoint key dietary factors associated with osteoporosis, we applied least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. These factors were integrated into a nomogram for risk prediction, with the model's discriminative ability assessed via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Osteoporosis patients had higher DII scores than those without the condition (1.61 vs. 1.18, p < 0.001). After adjusting for covariates, participants in the highest DII quartile had an 88% greater risk of osteoporosis (OR: 1.88, 95% CI: 1.41-2.52, P for trend <0.001). Restricted cubic spline analysis confirmed a linear relationship between DII and osteoporosis risk. Subgroup analyses showed similar patterns across different groups, as illustrated by the forest plot. LASSO regression identified key dietary factors, which were used to build a nomogram with an AUC of 83.6%, indicating strong predictive accuracy. A higher DII is strongly linked to increased osteoporosis risk, underscoring the importance of reducing dietary inflammation to help prevent osteoporosis.","2025","Frontiers in nutrition"

The aim of this work is to create a method for processing next-generation sequencing (NGS) data and an interpretable binary classification model (CM), which analyzed cfDNA fragmentation features for distinguishing healthy subjects and subjects with LC. 148 healthy subjects and 138 subjects with LC were included in the study. cfDNA fractions, isolated from blood plasma biospecimens, were used for DNA libraries preparations and NGS on the NovaSeq 6,000 Illumina system with a coverage of 100 million reads/sample. Twelve variables, describing the abundance and length distribution of cfDNA fragments within each genomic interval, and 40 variables based on the values of position-weight matrices, describing combinations of 5-bp-long terminal motifs of cfDNA fragments, were used to characterize genomic fragmentation. Classification models of the first phase of machine learning were based either on logistic regression with L1- and L2-regularization or were probabilistic CMs based on Gaussian processes. The second phase CM was based on kernel logistic regression. The final CM can distinguish healthy subjects and subjects with LC with AUC values of 0.872-0.875. The performance of developed CM was evaluated using datum and testing sets for each LC stage category. Sensitivity values ranged from 66.7 to 85.7%, from 77.8 to 100%, and from 70 to 80% for LC stages I, II, and III, respectively. Specificity values ranged from 79.3 to 90.0%. Thus, the CM has a good diagnostic value and does not require clinical or other data on tumor-associated biomarkers. The current method for LC detection has some advantages for future clinical implementation as a decision-making support system due to the performance of the CM requires data exclusively from NGS-analysis of blood plasma cfDNA fragmentation; the accuracy of the CM does not depend on any additional clinical data; the CM is highly interpretable and traceable; CM has appropriate modular architecture.","2025","Frontiers in medicine"

Therefore, accurate monitoring tests are needed to identify high risk beef products and divert them from consumers. Most EHEC testing focuses on the detection of their key virulence factors Shiga toxin (stx) and intimin (eae). However, these two factors can occur separately in lower risk nonpathogenic E. coli (STEC and enteropathogenic E. coli; EPEC) and confound testing if both are present. Accessory virulence factors like the Type III secreted effectors espK and espV may aid in increasing the specificity of EHEC testing. This work first evaluated collections of EHEC (n = 83), STEC (n = 100) and EPEC (n = 95), finding espK and/or espV in 100%, 0%, and 60% of each, respectively. Next, an inoculation study of beef trim samples (n = 118) examined the ability of including espK and espV in the monitoring test scheme to distinguish samples inoculated with EHEC from those inoculated with mixtures of STEC and EPEC (non-EHEC). Test accuracy was calculated as Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUC) and found to be significantly (p < 0.05) different, increasing from 68.0% (stx/eae) to 76.8% by including espK and espV. Finally, 361 regulatory agency beef samples that had been identified as suspect for EHEC (stx+/eae+) were examined with the addition of espK and espV, and results compared to culture isolation. Culture isolation identified 42 EHEC, 82 STEC, and 67 EPEC isolates in 146 of the samples. In the case of these naturally contaminated samples, inclusion of espK and espV increased test accuracy compared to culture isolation from an AUC of 50.5% (random agreement) to 69.8% (good agreement). Results show that the inclusion of espK and espV can increase the specificity of identifying high risk EHEC contaminated beef and release beef contaminated with nonpathogenic or low risk E. coli. Further, use of espK and espV identified samples contaminated by common EHEC of serogroups O157, O26, and O103, as well as of less common serogroups O182, O177, and O5.","2025","Foods (Basel, Switzerland)"

The aim of this study is to validate the BCN-MRI PM for sPCa when a highly effective prostate biopsy protocol is used. Methods: A prospective cohort of 457 men suspected of having PCa, for whom MRI results were reported with the Prostate Imaging-Reporting and Data System (PI-RADS) v 2.1, underwent a per 0.5 mm-core mapping targeted biopsy of suspicious lesions and perilesional areas, followed by a 12-core-systematic biopsy. These procedures took place between 1 February 2022, and 29 February 2024, at a reference center for prostate biopsy. The individual likelihood of sPCa was assessed through the BCN-MRI risk calculator. Results: The overall sPCa detection rate was 58.3%. The calibration curve of the BCN-MRI PM showed an appropriate accuracy between expected and observed probabilities with a discrimination ability for sPCa yielding an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.862 (95% CI 0.828-0.896) comparable to the AUC of 0.858 (95% CI 0.833-0.883) observed in the development cohort. The application of the BCN-MRI PM provided a net benefit over performing biopsies on all men, avoiding 24.9% of prostate biopsies at 95% sensitivity for sPCa, compared to the 23.7% reduction observed in the development cohort. Conclusions: We conclude that the BCN-MRI PM is ready to be implemented when this biopsy protocol is employed.","2025","Cancers"

The aim of this study was to observe and understand the metabolic changes in CRC through targeted metabolomics. Samples collected from 58 CRC patients and 35 healthy individuals have been analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), targeting two classes of metabolites: amino acids and acylcarnitines. Statistical analysis revealed 26 significantly modified (p-value < 0.01; |FC| > 1.2) metabolites in CRC patients compared to the control group and 22 between colon cancer and control, whereas 8 metabolites differed only significantly between rectal cancer and healthy patients. Some of these significantly modified metabolites characterize cancer-specific adaptations, such as increased energy demand, increased tumor invasiveness, capabilities to promote amino acid synthesis, and tumor resistance against acute immune response. Moreover, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) analysis revealed that a set of two acylcarnitines (C6DC and C4-OH) can differentiate between CRC patients and healthy individuals with a high degree of confidence (AUC 0.837). By implementing a metabolomics approach targeting amino acids and acylcarnitines, several metabolic alterations induced by CRC have been highlighted. Even though these modifications are not specific enough to act as disease markers, they might prove useful for evaluating patient status.","2025","Cancers"

In the clinical setting, a variety of blood-based angiogenesis- and immune-related factors are being increasingly investigated as potential biomarkers of prognosis or treatment response in immunotherapy-treated NSCLC. We herein aimed to evaluate the clinical relevance of the peripheral blood levels of vascular endothelial growth factor-A and -B (VEGF-A and VEGF-B, respectively), soluble programmed cell death-1 (sPD-1), and programmed cell death-ligand 1 (sPD-L1) in patients with advanced NSCLC treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). Methods: Consecutive patients with advanced-stage, non-oncogene-addicted NSCLC, eligible to receive ICIs at the Oncology Unit of Sotiria Athens General Hospital, were prospectively recruited. A group of sex- and age-matched healthy controls was also enrolled for the evaluation of the potential diagnostic significance of the examined biomarkers. Serum levels of all biomarkers were measured using ELISA, both before and after treatment, and were correlated with standard clinicopathological features of patients, treatment response, progression-free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS). Results: A total of 55 patients and 16 healthy controls were included in the final analysis. The mean age of patients and controls was 66.5 years (SD = 8.0 years) and 65.4 years (SD = 9.1 years), respectively. The majority of patients (65.5%) received pembrolizumab in combination with chemotherapy, while the remaining patients received pembrolizumab monotherapy. ROC curve analysis showed that VEGFB and sPD-1 were the only markers with a significant diagnostic value. Higher pre-treatment values of sPD-L1 (HR = 1.68; p = 0.040) and sPD-1 (HR = 10.96; p = 0.037) as well as higher post-treatment values of VEGF-B (HR = 2.99; p = 0.049) were all significantly associated with a reduced OS in univariate Cox regression analysis. The adverse prognostic significance of higher pre-treatment values of sPD-L1 (HR = 2.10; p = 0.014) and higher post-treatment values of VEGFB (HR = 3.37; p = 0.032) was further confirmed in multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Our study results suggest that serum levels of sPD-L1 and VEGF-B may independently predict prognosis in ICI-treated advanced-stage NSCLC.","2025","Cancers"
36,"39941750","Retrospectively Quantified T2 Improves Detection of Clinically Significant Peripheral Zone Prostate Cancer.","Multiparametric MRI (mpMRI) as a non-invasive imaging tool is important in prostate cancer (PCa) detection and localization. Combined with radiomics analysis, features extracted from mpMRI have been utilized to predict PCa aggressiveness. T2 mapping provides quantitative information in PCa diagnoses but is not routinely available in clinical practice. Previous work from our group developed a deep learning-based method to estimate T2 maps from clinically acquired T1- and T2-weighted images. This study aims to evaluate the added value of the estimated T2 map by combining it with conventional T2-weighted images for detecting clinically significant PCa (csPCa). An amount of 76 peripheral zone prostate lesions, including clinically significant and insignificant cases, were retrospectively analyzed. Radiomic features were extracted from conventional T2-weighted images and deep learning-estimated T2 maps, followed by feature selection and model development using five-fold cross-validation. Logistic regression and Gaussian Process classifiers were employed to develop the prediction models, with performance evaluated by area under the curve (AUC) and accuracy metrics. The model incorporating features from both T2-weighted images and estimated T2 maps achieved an AUC of 0.803, significantly outperforming the model based solely on T2-weighted image features (AUC of 0.700, p = 0.048). Radiomics features extracted from deep learning-estimated T2 maps provide additional quantitative information that improves the prediction of peripheral zone csPCa aggressiveness, potentially enhancing risk stratification in non-invasive PCa diagnostics.","2025","Cancers"

The objective of this study was to review the literature on the applications of ML/RM in OC assessments, specifically focusing on studies describing algorithms to predict treatment response and survival. Methods: This is a systematic review of the published literature from January 1985 to December 2023 on the use of ML/RM in OC An extensive search of electronic library databases was conducted. Two independent reviewers screened the articles initially by title then by full text. Quality was assessed using the MINORS criteria. p-values were generated using the Pearson's Chi-squared (x2) test to compare the performances of ML/RM models with traditional statistics. Results: Of the 5576 screened articles, 225 studies were included. Between 2021 and 2023, 49 studies were published, highlighting the rapidly growing interest in ML/RM. Median-quality scores using the MINORS scale were similar between studies published between 1985-2021 and 2021-2023 (both 8). Neural Networks (22.6%) and LASSO (15.3%) were the most common ML/RM algorithms in OC. Among these studies, 13 focused specifically on prediction of treatment response using radiomics. A total of 5113 patients were analyzed. The most common algorithms were Random Forest (4/13) followed by Neural Networks (3/13) and Support Vectors (3/13). Radiomic analysis was used to predict response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in seven studies, with a median AUC of 0.77 (range 0.72-0.93), while the median AUC was 0.82 (range 0.77-0.89) in the six studies assessing the prediction of optimal or complete cytoreduction. Median model accuracy reported in 7/13 studies was 73% (range 66-98%). Additionally, four studies investigated the use of ML/RM for survival prediction for OC. The XGBoost model had 80.9% accuracy in predicting 5-year survival compared to linear regression, which achieved 79% accuracy. The Random Forest model has 93.7% accuracy in predicting 12-month progression-free survival, compared to 82% for linear regression. Conclusions: In conclusion, we found that the use of ML/RM algorithms is becoming a more frequent method to predict responses to treatment of OC. These models should be validated in a prospective multicenter trial prior to integration into clinical use.","2025","Cancers"

Methods: The study's design entailed a prospective cross-sectional observational study methodology. The patient group consisted of 80 consecutive children aged 8-18 years who had been diagnosed with T1DM for at least ten years and had not developed any chronic clinical complications related to T1DM. The control group consisted of 72 completely healthy children with similar demographic characteristics. Serum levels of sLOX-1 were measured, and carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT) was evaluated using ultrasonography in all subjects. Results: A statistical analysis of the results was conducted. The serum sLOX-1 level was found to be significantly higher in the patient group than in the control group (0.49 ± 0.11 vs. 0.82 ± 0.35; p < 0.001). The statistical significance observed was maintained in the multivariable logistic regression analysis (p < 0.001). A significant correlation was identified between cIMT and serum sLOX-1 levels (r = 0.669, p < 0.001). The receiver operating characteristic curve for sLOX-1 indicated that a cutoff value greater than 0.65 ng/mL was associated with T1DM. Conclusions: Serum sLOX-1 levels were markedly elevated in children with T1DM who had not yet manifested chronic complications. These findings suggest that elevated serum sLOX-1 levels may be associated with the progression of atherosclerosis in children with T1DM.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

Objective: To assess the diagnostic performance of cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)-based four-dimensional (4D)-flow analysis in identifying CpcPH. Methods: Prospective observational study of heart failure (HF) patients with suspected pulmonary hypertension (PH) who underwent simultaneous CMR and right heart catheterization. The 4D-flow biomarkers were calculated using an automatic pipeline. A predictive model including 4D-flow biomarkers associated with CpcPH with a p-value < 0.20 was built to determine the diagnostic performance of 4D-flow analysis to identify CpcPH. Results: A total of 46 HF patients (55.4 ± 14 years, 63% male) with confirmed PH (19 [41%] isolated postcapillary PH [IpcPH], 27 [59%] CpcPH) were included. No differences were found in baseline characteristics, echocardiography, or CMR anatomical and functional parameters, except for a higher Doppler-estimated systolic pulmonary pressure and larger pulmonary artery in CpcPH patients. The 4D-flow CMR analysis was performed in 31 patients (67%). The maximal peak velocity (67.1 [62.2-77.5] cm/s-IpcPH vs. 58.2 [45.8-66.0] cm/s-CpcPH; p = 0.021) and maximal helicity (339.9 [290.0-391.8]) cm/s2-IpcPH vs. 226.0 (173.5-343.7) cm/s2-CpcPH; p = 0.026) were significantly lower in patients with CpcPH.

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 540 patients who were followed up after a diagnosis of early-stage colorectal cancer and whose albumin (ALB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), neutrophil, platelet, and lymphocyte values were measured before treatment. Results: In the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis for overall survival (OS), the AAPR index Area Under Curve (AUC):0.560, (p = 0.018), NLR index (p = 0.079), and PLR index (p = 0.692) were evaluated. In the ROC analysis for OS, a cut-off value of the AAPR index of ≤0.423 was found. In the AAPR-low group, the relapse and death rates were higher than in the AAPR-high group (p = 0.004 and p = 0.001, respectively). As the AAPR index decreased, the NLR and PLR indexes increased (p = 0.027 and p = 0.003, respectively). Median disease-free survival (DFS) was worse in the AAPR-low group (128 versus 156) months (p = 0.015). The AAPR index significantly affected OS with hazard ratio (HR):0.42 (95%CI, 0.18-0.97) (p = 0.044). At 5 years, 68% of the patients in the AAPR-low group and 79% of the patients in the AAPR-high group were alive (p = 0.005). In a multivariate analysis, low AAPR, patient age at diagnosis, TNM stage, and recurrence status were independent factors affecting OS (p = 0.022, p < 0.001, p = 0.002, and p < 0.001, respectively). Conclusions: In early-stage colorectal cancer patients, the OS was worse in the AAPR-low group than in the AAPR-high group.

The current study aimed to evaluate serum biomarkers for predicting mental instability, which is challenging to objectively quantify. Methods: In total, 29 refractory UC patients newly treated with filgotinib underwent measurements of blood parameters associated with depression and a quantitative assessment of quality of life using the Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire (IBDQ) before and after treatment initiation with a 12-week interval. The data collected were examined in relation to each other. Results: The induction of remission treatment with filgotinib resulted in a clinical response rate of 89.7% and a clinical remission rate of 86.2%, with all eight extraintestinal manifestations resolved. No adverse events were observed. The serum zinc, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, mature brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) concentrations, and the IBDQ psychiatric subscores increased significantly after treatment (p < 0.05). Among these parameters, the mature-BDNF concentration and the IBDQ psychiatric subscore had the strongest positive correlation (R = 0.29, p = 0.08). Based on the logistic regression analysis, the mature-BDNF concentration (cutoff value: 20.5 ng/mL) had a sensitivity of 68.2%, specificity of 64.7%, and area under the curve of 0.67 for predicting psychiatric remission (subscore > 42.5) (p = 0.04).

We aimed to evaluate lipoprotein-related biomarkers of EAT volume in T2DM patients before and after glycemic control. Methods: This study included 36 T2DM patients before and after optimization of glycemic control and on 14 healthy controls (HCs). EAT volume was measured using computed tomography imaging indexed to the body surface area (iEAT). Biochemical and lipid profiles were determined using commercial methods. Lipoproteins were isolated by ultracentrifugation, and variables of lipoprotein function were assessed. Multivariable regression analysis was used to find variables independently associated with iEAT. Results: iEAT was higher in T2DM than in controls and decreased with glycemic optimization. HDLs from T2DM had less apoA-I and cholesterol and more apoC-III and triglycerides. LDLs from T2DM had more triglycerides and apoB and smaller sizes than those from HCs. Significant correlations were found between iEAT and age, BMI, HbA1c, GGT, VLDLc, triglycerides, LDL size, apoA-I in HDL, and apoC-III in HDL. In the multivariable regression analysis, age, LDL size, and GGT associations remained statistically significant, and predicted 50% of the variability in EAT volume. ROC analysis using these variables showed an AUC of 0.835. Conclusions: Qualitative characteristics of lipoproteins were altered in T2DM. Multivariable analysis showed that LDL size and GGT plasma levels were independently associated with iEAT volume, suggesting that these variables might be useful biomarkers for stratifying T2DM patients with increased EAT volume.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

The study aims to evaluate the integration of Fourier Transform Infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy and machine learning algorithms as a minimally invasive method to detect kidney allograft rejection and differentiate between T Cell-Mediated Rejection (TCMR) and Antibody-Mediated Rejection (AMR). Additionally, the goal is to discriminate these rejection types aiming to develop a reliable decision-making support tool. Methods: This retrospective study included 41 kidney transplant recipients and analyzed 81 serum samples matched to corresponding allograft biopsies. FTIR spectroscopy was applied to pre-biopsy serum samples, and Naïve Bayes classification models were developed to distinguish rejection from non-rejection and classify rejection types. Data preprocessing involved, e.g., atmospheric compensation, second derivative, and feature selection using Fast Correlation-Based Filter for spectral regions 600-1900 cm-1 and 2800-3400 cm-1. Model performance was assessed via area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy. Results: The Naïve Bayes model achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.945 in classifying rejection versus non-rejection and AUC-ROC of 0.989 in distinguishing TCMR from AMR. Feature selection significantly improved model performance, identifying key spectral wavenumbers associated with rejection mechanisms. This approach demonstrated high sensitivity and specificity for both classification tasks. Conclusions: The integration of FTIR spectroscopy with machine learning may provide a promising, minimally invasive method for early detection and precise classification of kidney allograft rejection.

Methods: CBCT images of 100 patients were randomly selected from the data archive. The raw data were transferred to the 3D Slicer imaging software in DICOM format (Version 4.10.2; MIT, Massachusetts, USA). NLC was labeled using the polygonal type of manual method. The dataset was split into training, validation and test sets in a ratio of 8:1:1. nnU-Net v2 architecture was applied to the training and test datasets to predict and generate appropriate algorithm weight factors. The confusion matrix was used to check the accuracy and performance of the model. As a result of the test, the Dice Coefficient (DC), Intersection over Union (IoU), F1-Score and 95% Hausdorff distance (95% HD) metrics were calculated. Results: By testing the model, DC, IoU, F1-Scores and 95% HD metric values were found to be 0.8465, 0.7341, 0.8480 and 0.9460, respectively. According to the data obtained, the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn and the AUC value under the curve was determined to be 0.96. Conclusions: These results showed that the proposed nnU-Net v2 model achieves NLC segmentation on CBCT images with high precision and accuracy.

48,"39941416","A Longitudinal Assessment of Metabolic Syndrome.","Background/Objectives: Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a combination of conditions including central obesity, high blood pressure, high glucose levels, and abnormal triglycerides and cholesterol, which together increase the chances of heart disease, diabetes, and even death. The rates of MetS are different around the world, with 20-30% in Europe and 21.8-23.9% in Kazakhstan. Because MetS changes over time, it is important to study the dynamics of their components to improve prevention and treatments. This work aims to obtain the incidence of MetS and to evaluate the specific components associated with the emergence of new MetS cases in this population. Methods: This is a longitudinal study with a 10-year follow-up in Turkestan city between 2012 and 2024. Information was collected through physical exams, blood tests, and anthropometric measurements. Logistic regression and ROC curve analysis were used to find which factors increase the incidence of MetS. Results: Among 434 participants analyzed (78.8% women, and mean age 40.87, 66% < 2 MetS components, 20% had MetS blood pressure, and 65.9% had MetS waist circumference), the incidence of MetS at follow-up was 40%. The key risk factors for newly diagnosed MetS included elevated blood pressure and increased waist circumference. Multivariate analyses highlighted these components as the strongest predictors of MetS, with significant associations observed for participants with two or more MetS components at baseline. Conclusions: Elevated blood pressure and central obesity were identified as pivotal contributors to MetS progression. Given the rising prevalence of Mets and its implications, these results show the need to start treatment and check these risks early to prevent serious health problems.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

Recently, research has analyzed electrocardiograms (ECGs) during chest compressions using convolutional neural networks (CNNs). This study aimed to compare the accuracy of deeper neural networks and more advanced structures. Methods: ECGs with chest compression artifacts were obtained from patients who visited the emergency department of Korea University Ansan Hospital from September 2019 to February 2024. We compared the accuracy of a deeper CNN, long short-term memory (LSTM), and a CNN with an attention mechanism and residual block against a reference model. The input of the model was 5 s ECG segments with compression artifacts, and the output was the probability that the ECG with the artifacts was a shockable rhythm. Results: A total of 1889 ECGs with compression artifacts from 172 patients were included in this study. There were 969 ECGs annotated as shockable and 920 as non-shockable. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of the reference model was 0.8672. The AUROCs of the deeper CNN for five and seven layers were 0.7374 and 0.6950, respectively. The AUROCs of LSTM and bidirectional LSTM were 0.7719 and 0.8287, respectively. The AUROC of the CNN with the attention mechanism and residual block was 0.7759. Conclusions: CNNs with deeper layers or those incorporating attention mechanisms, residual blocks, and LSTM architectures did not exhibit better accuracy. To improve the model accuracy, a larger dataset or advanced augmentation techniques may be required, rather than complicating the structure of the model.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

The untapped potential of combining the neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio (NLR) with the monocyte/lymphocyte ratio (MLR) and platelet/lymphocyte ratio (PLR) and their correlation with the pneumonia severity index (PSI) and CURB-65 motivated our research. We thought that this would provide more robust data for predicting CAP prognosis. We aimed to assess hematologic parameters' associations with the PSI, CURB-65, and qSOFA scores for predicting the prognosis of hospitalized CAP patients. DESIGN AND SETTING: This is a multicenter, observational study conducted in three hospitals in Türkiye, Antalya. Methods: A total of 343 patients hospitalized with CAP in three centers in Turkey, Antalya, between 1 January 2020 and 30 September 2023 were retrospectively enrolled. The demographic data, comorbidities, vital signs, radiological images, laboratory findings, and 30-day mortality results of the patients were recorded. CURB-65, PSI, and qSOFA scores were calculated. Results: This study included 163 females (47%) with an average age of 74 ± 11.8. Hospital mortality occurred in 51 patients. Non-survivor CAP cases had higher ages (p = 0.007), CURB-65 scores (p < 0.001), PSIs (p < 0.001), and qSOFA scores (p < 0.001) and a longer hospital stay (p = 0.001) and total antibiotic duration (p < 0.001). Additionally, the NLR (p = 0.009), MLR (p = 0.018), and PLR (p = 0.025) were higher in the non-survivor group. The CURB-65, PSI, and qSOFA scores demonstrated strong predictive capabilities for in-hospital mortality. In the ROC analysis conducted to predict in-hospital mortality, the area under the curve (AUC) for CURB-65, the PSI, and qSOFA was determined to be 0.83, 0.82, and 0.82, respectively. The NLR correlated positively with CURB-65, the PSI, and qSOFA; the PLR correlated with the PSI and qSOFA; and the MLR correlated with CURB-65. Conclusions: CURB-65 and PSI scores remain highly effective for predicting in-hospital mortality in CAP patients, as demonstrated by their superior AUC values. While the NLR, MLR, and PLR showed weak predictive performance compared to these scores, their correlations suggest their potential as adjunctive markers.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"
51,"39941377","Development and Validation of a Quantitative Score for the Criteria Clinical Control in Stable COPD Proposed in the Spanish COPD Guidelines (GesEPOC): Results of the EPOCONSUL Audit.","Introduction/Objective: the concept of clinical control of COPD is a measure proposed in the Spanish COPD Guidelines (GesEPOC), which aims to help clinicians assess the clinical status in order to adapt the treatment plan at follow-up. However, studies that have evaluated clinical practice reveal that the degree of control of COPD is not always assessed, which underlines the need to promote its assessment through a scoring system. To develop a scoring system that quantitatively assesses the validated criteria defining the degree of COPD control. Methods: this study used data from the EPOCONSUL audit in respiratory clinics across Spain. We included in this analysis all patients with a COPD clinical control grade estimated and reported by the physician at the visit, who had registered the criteria necessary to define the degree of clinical control validated and established in GesEPOC. Patients were randomly assigned to either the development or validation cohorts. The development cohort included 485 patients and the validation cohort included 341 patients. Score modelling was conducted using a multivariate logistic regression model, and calibration of the model and score was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test and GiViTi Calibration belts. The model and generated score's discrimination capacity were analyzed by calculating the Area Under the Curve (AUC). Results: the scoring system was developed using four criteria as predictors of poor clinical control of COPD reported by the treating physician:adjusted dyspnoea severity, use of rescue inhaler more than three times per week, walking less than 30 min per day, and COPD exacerbations in the last three months. The scoring system attributed scores from 0 to 8. Calibration was satisfactory in both development and validation cohorts, and the score's discrimination power, as indicated by the AUC, was 0.892. Conclusions: this scoring system provides an easy-to-use quantitative assessment of clinical control of COPD that we believe will help to measure COPD control and its evolution during patient follow-up. Future research will be needed to prospectively evaluate this score as a predictor of outcome.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

However, the 2022 NICHD BPD outcome estimator's performance in the Canadian setting has not been validated. Our objective is to validate the NICHD BPD outcome estimator 2022 in predicting death and or moderate to severe BPD at 36 weeks in infants less than 29 weeks admitted to NICU. Methods: A retrospective observational study (March 2022-August 2023) was conducted on both inborn and outborn preterm infants excluding neonates with major congenital anomalies. Infants were classified into six groups based on the predicted risk of death or Grade 2 or 3 BPD (<10%, 10-20%, 20-30%, 30-40%, 50-59%, ≥60%) followed by noting observed outcomes from the unit's database. A receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to assess the accuracy of the NICHD BPD outcome estimator 2022, with an area under curve (AUC) > 0.7 defined a priori as an acceptable predictive accuracy for local use. Results: Among 99 infants included, 13 (13.1%) died, and 40 (40.4%) developed BPD. Median gestational age was 26 weeks, and median birth weight was 914 g. Twenty-three infants (23.2%) received postnatal steroids. The AUC values for death or moderate to severe BPD on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 were 0.803, 0.806, 0.837, 0.832, and 0.843, respectively. The AUC values for moderate to severe BPD alone on those days were 0.766, 0.746, 0.785, 0.807, and 0.818 respectively. Conclusions: The 2022 BPD estimator adequately predicted the death and/or moderate to severe BPD on days 1, 3, 7, 14, and 28 of life. This tool could serve as a valid adjunct to facilitate discussion between clinicians and families on initiating time-sensitive targeted interventions to prevent or alter the course of BPD.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

This study investigates the diagnostic performance of photopic negative response (PhNR) amplitude and the normalized PhNR/b-wave ratio in diagnosing glaucoma, focusing on the impact of myopia. Methods: Ninety-one glaucoma patients and 19 glaucoma suspects were included, defining myopia as axial length (AL) > 24 mm or > 25 mm. Full-field photopic ERG used a red stimulus on a blue background. Results: Myopic glaucoma patients showed a higher PhNR/b-wave ratio than non-myopic patients (p = 0.023). AL negatively correlated with b-wave amplitude (r = -0.239, p = 0.012). PhNR amplitude demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.661 (p = 0.028) overall and was less effective in the myopic subgroup (AUC = 0.574, p = 0.082). The diagnostic performance of the PhNR/b-wave ratio did not achieve statistical significance in either the total group (AUC = 0.616, p = 0.114) or the myopic subgroup (AUC = 0.574, p = 0.332). Conclusions: Standardization using the PhNR/b-wave ratio did not enhance diagnostic accuracy over PhNR amplitude, particularly in myopic patients, underscoring the need for careful interpretation in myopia and further research to optimize electrophysiological diagnostics.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

Often, clinicians will need to evaluate dementia status during a single assessment, and here we describe empirically supported methods effective under such circumstances. Archived data collected between 1987 and 2017 included longitudinal findings for 144 individuals maintaining cognitive stability and 126 developing prodromal DS-AD. Response operating characteristic analyses compared groups, defined by the presence/absence of prodromal DS-AD, for a single assessment. Groups differed on all measures without adjusting for developmental history, 0.717 < areas under the curve < 0.859, Ps < 0.0001. The balance between sensitivity and specificity improved slightly when developmental histories were considered. The present study demonstrated that one-time assessments can inform clinical judgments when diagnosing adults at risk for DS-AD. Knowledge of developmental history is valuable but non-essential. Non-overlapping distributions were observed for preclinical and prodromal Alzheimer's disease (AD) groups.Receiver operating characteristic area under the curve analyses were in the acceptable to excellent range for all measures.Performance was sensitive to both the severity of intellectual disability and the stage of Down syndrome-AD progression.Episodic memory tests were sensitive to the transition from preclinical to prodromal AD.Performance results at a single time point can inform dementia status decisions.","2025","Alzheimer's & dementia (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"

Moreover, Peg-IFN-α is clinically limited due to several side effects. It is of significant value to early identify the favored population for Peg-IFN-α therapy in CHB patients. This study aimed to analyze the impact of HBeAg/anti-HBe coexistence on the effectiveness of Peg-IFN-α and to construct a nomogram for predicting the occurrence of HBeAg seroconversion in treatment-naïve CHB patients with Peg-IFN-α therapy. Retrospective, case-control study of treatment-naïve CHB patients with Peg-IFN-α at a tertiary care center. Data from HBeAg-positive treatment-naïve CHB patients were retrospectively analyzed. Clinical characteristics of the HBeAg/anti-HBe coexistence group were compared with those of the anti-HBe-negative group. In addition, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent risk factors for HBeAg seroconversion. The nomogram for the prediction of HBeAg seroconversion was constructed and evaluated. A total of 140 HBeAg-positive CHB patients were enrolled. Patients with HBeAg/anti-HBe coexistence accounted for 11.4% of HBeAg-positive patients, and their hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and HBeAg levels were significantly lower than those of anti-HBe negative patients, but the HBeAg seroconversion rate was higher after Peg-IFN-α treatment. As revealed by multivariate logistic analysis, HBeAg/anti-HBe coexistence, baseline HBsAg, baseline HBeAg, and alanine aminotransferase ratio at baseline were independent correlates of HBeAg seroconversion. The nomogram model constructed based on these four independent correlates demonstrated good discrimination (area under the curve = 0.866), calibration, and clinical adaptability. HBeAg/anti-HBe coexistence is associated with a higher HBeAg seroconversion rate, and the nomogram model constructed based on HBeAg/anti-HBe coexistence performs well in predicting HBeAg seroconversion in treatment-naïve CHB patients treated with Peg-IFN-α therapy.","2025","Therapeutic advances in gastroenterology"

The training set was further divided into a PD-L1 positive group and a PD-L1 negative group, based on the combined positive score (CPS). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to identify independent predictors of PD-L1 positivity. A nomogram was developed to assess the model's predictive performance, which was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). It was also compared with the model established by previous study. Patients with PD-L1-positive gastric adenocarcinoma exhibited a higher prevalence of larger short diameters of lymph nodes (LNs) (≥ 1 cm), and lower CT attenuation values in the venous and delayed phases compared to those in the PD-L1-negative group. Short diameter of LNs, and CT attenuation values in the delayed phase were identified as independent predictors of PD-L1 positivity. The nomogram analysis indicated that CT attenuation values in the delayed phase were the most significant predictor of PD-L1 positivity, followed by short diameter of LNs.

We studied ML classifier models: RF, RF + SMOTE, RF + ADASYN, SVM, SVM + SMOTE and SVM + ADASYN on the six-class imbalanced dataset of stingless bees morphometrics. Multi-class area under curve (AUC), F1-score, G-mean, balanced accuracy, sensitivity and ""No information rate"" were used to assess model performance. SMOTE and ADASYN marginally improved the performance of RF and SVM classifiers. SVM outperformed RF, with SVM using SMOTE performing better than with ADASYN. SVM with ADASYN had a lower multi-class AUC (0.9898) and sensitivity (0.956) but a higher F1-score (0.939) compared to SVM with SMOTE (AUC = 0.9918, sensitivity = 0.959, F1-score = 0.934). Overall, SVM with SMOTE was superior to RF with SMOTE. All models except SVM with ADASYN, correctly classified four of the six species, M. (Meliponula) bocandei, M.

This study aims to develop a novel deep learning model to provide efficient, accurate, and cost-effective auxiliary diagnosis for the pathological types of lung cancer cells. This paper introduces a model named PortNet, designed to significantly reduce the model's parameter size and achieve lightweight characteristics without compromising classification accuracy. We incorporated 1 × 1 convolutional blocks into the Depthwise Separable Convolution architecture to further decrease the model's parameter count. Additionally, the integration of the Squeeze-and-Excitation self-attention module enhances feature representation without substantially increasing the number of parameters, thereby maintaining high predictive performance. Our tests demonstrated that PortNet significantly reduces the total parameter count to 2,621,827, which is over a fifth smaller compared to some mainstream CNN models, marking a substantial advancement for deployment in portable devices. We also established widely-used traditional models as benchmarks to illustrate the efficacy of PortNet. In external tests, PortNet achieved an average accuracy (ACC) of 99.89 % and Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 99.27 %. During five-fold cross-validation, PortNet maintained an average ACC of 99.51 % ± 1.50 % and F1 score of 99.50 % ± 1.51 %, showcasing its lightweight capability and exceptionally high accuracy. This presents a promising opportunity for integration into hospital systems to assist physicians in diagnosis.

This study aims to compare the association of Life's Simple 7 (LS7) and Life's Essential 8 (LE8) with kidney stone prevalence. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted utilizing NHANES data (2007-2018). Participants aged ≥20 yr with a history of kidney stones and available LS7 and LE8 scores were included. Both LS7 and LE8 are scored such that higher scores indicate better CVH. Weighted proportions and multivariable logistic regression models assessed the relationship between CVH metrics and kidney stone prevalence, adjusting for confounders. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the ROC curve (AUC) were determined to distinguish between LS7 and LE8 in terms of their discriminative ability within the model associated with kidney stones. A total of 23 563 adults were included; the mean age was 48.1 yr (48.1% male). Kidney stone prevalence was 10.1%. The mean LS7 and LE8 scores were 8.4 and 68.6, respectively. A multivariate analysis and the restricted cubic spline model indicated a significant nonlinear negative correlation between these CVH measures and kidney stone prevalence. The LS7 ideal group showed a lower prevalence than the poor group (odds ratio [OR] = 0.53; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.41-0.69). The high CVH group had a lower prevalence than the low CVH group (OR = 0.46; 95% CI 0.36-0.57). The AUCs for evaluating LS7 and kidney stones, as well as for LE8 and kidney stones were 0.676 and 0.677, respectively. Limitations were as follows: cross-sectional design limiting causal inference, recall bias from self-reported data, and potential residual confounding. Both CVH algorithms show a significant nonlinear negative correlation with kidney stone prevalence. LS7 may be more accessible for broader implementation. Further high-quality prospective studies are needed to clarify this relationship. In this study, we explored the connection between heart health and kidney stones using data from a large national survey. We found that better heart health, measured by two different scoring methods, is linked to a lower chance of having kidney stones. Our results suggest that promoting heart health could help reduce the risk of kidney stones in adults.","2025","European urology open science"

Due to its high mortality rate, it is an important health issue. Therefore, this study aims to explore the factors influencing infant and toddler heart failure patients during hospitalization, establish predictive models, and a mortality scoring table. The study ultimately included 544 cases of infant heart failure patients. They were randomly divided into a training set (380 cases) and a validation set (164 cases) in a ratio of 7:3. The training set was then further divided into the death group and the survival group for further analysis of indicators during hospitalization. Using the Lasso regression method, this study selected the best 14 variables from 88 independent variables of infants and toddlers with heart failure. Multivariate Logistic regression results show that TP < 65 g/L (OR = 2.34), pH < 7.35 (OR = 2.79), and Respiratory rate (1-12 months: <30times/min and 13-36 months: <25times/min, OR = 2.34) are independent risk factors. The model evaluation results for the train and test sets of infant and toddler heart failure patients are as follows: C-index values for discrimination in the train and test sets are 0.721 and 0.728, respectively. Fit test calibration evaluations show P values of 0.9958 and 0.9998, both greater than 0.05, indicating good calibration. The AUC values for the train and test sets are 0.75 and 0.64, respectively, showing a good predictive effect of the model. The mortality scoring table divides patients in the train and test sets into low risk, moderate-risk, and high risk categories. Compared to the low risk group, the OR values for the occurrence of mortality in the Medium risk group and high risk group in the train set are 3.78 and 11.67, respectively; in the test set, the OR values for the moderate-risk group and high-risk group are 1.73 and 6.33, respectively. The predictive models and scoring tables established in this study have a good predictive role in assessing the risk of death in infant and toddler heart failure patients aged 1-36 months during hospitalization, providing clinical guidance and reference value.","2025","Heliyon"
66,"39926431","Plasma EphA2 level is a superior biomarker to Del-1 for sepsis diagnosis and prognosis.","Sepsis, characterized by a dysregulated host response to infection, often leads to organ dysfunction, and vascular endothelial dysfunction plays a central role. The erythropoietin-producing hepatocellular carcinoma (Eph)A2 receptor is associated with increased vascular permeability; however, the developmental endothelial locus-1 (Del-1), has contrasting effects on endothelial function. Hence, we examined their potential as biomarkers of sepsis. In total, 117 participants, including 20 healthy controls, 21 patients with systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), and 76 patients with sepsis, were enrolled in this study. Sepsis severity was assessed using the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) II and the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) scores. The Median plasma EphA2 levels increased progressively from healthy controls to SIRS and sepsis cases (154.29, 293.52, and 554.24 pg/mL; all p < 0.05). The median plasma Del-1 levels were highest in healthy controls, lowest in SIRS, and intermediate level in sepsis (101.27, 16.88, and 36.9 pg/mL; all p < 0.001). The levels of both biomarkers were higher in 28-day non-survivors than in survivors, in patients with sepsis (EphA2:898.09 vs. 475.88 pg/mL, p < 0.001; Del-1:46.09 vs. 32.68 pg/mL, p = 0.193); however, only EphA2 was statistically significant. The area under the curve for the EphA2 was 0.74 in the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for predicting 28-day mortality, whereas APACHE II, SOFA, and Del-1 showed values of 0.762, 0.614, and 0.595, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis using these cutoffs revealed that survival was significantly higher in the group with both low EphA2 and Del-1 levels compared to the group with high levels of both markers (p < 0.001). Plasma EphA2 levels consistently increased with sepsis severity, suggesting its biomarker value for sepsis diagnosis and prognosis. In contrast, plasma Del-1 response was variable, indicating its limited prognostic utility.","2025","Frontiers in medicine"

We aimed to develop a deep learning (DL) model based on CT angiography (CTA) imaging and clinical data to diagnose AMI. A retrospective study was conducted on 228 patients suspected of AMI, divided into training and test sets. Clinical data (medical history and laboratory indicators) was included in a multivariate logistic regression analysis to identify the independent factors associated with AMI and establish a clinical factors model. The arterial and venous CTA images were utilized to construct DL model. A Fusion Model was constructed by integrating clinical factors into the DL model. The performance of the models was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). Albumin and International Normalized Ratio (INR) were associated with AMI by univariate and multivariate logistic regression (P < 0.05). In the test set, the area under ROC curve (AUC) of the clinical factor model was 0.60 (sensitivity 0.47, specificity 0.86). The AUC of the DL model based on CTA images reached 0.90, which was significantly higher than the AUC values of the clinical factor model, as confirmed by the DeLong test (P < 0.05). The Fusion Model also showed exceptional performance in terms of AUC, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and precision, with values of 0.96, 0.94, 0.94, 0.95, and 0.98, respectively. DCA indicated that the Fusion Model provided a greater net benefit than those of models based solely on imaging and clinical information across the majority of the reasonable threshold probabilities. The incorporation of CTA images and clinical information into the model markedly enhances the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency of AMI. This approach provides a reliable tool for the early diagnosis of AMI and the subsequent implementation of appropriate clinical intervention.","2025","Frontiers in medicine"

However, the treatment is associated with significant risks, including heightened toxicity and early mortality. This study aimed to quantify the 90-day mortality rate post-chemotherapy in SCLC patients, identify associated features, and develop a predictive machine learning model. This study utilized data from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database (2000-2018) to identify prognostic features influencing early mortality in SCLC patients. Prognostic features were selected through univariate logistic regression and Lasso analyses. Predictive modeling was performed using advanced machine learning algorithms, including XGBoost, Multilayer Perceptron, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest. Additionally, traditional models, such as logistic regression and AJCC staging, were employed for comparison. Model performance was evaluated using key metrics, including the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC), calibration plots, the Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistic, and Decision Curve Analysis (DCA). Analysis of 12,500 eligible patients revealed 10 clinical features significantly impacting outcomes. The XGBoost model demonstrated superior discriminatory capability, achieving AUC scores of 0.95 in the training set and 0.78 in the validation set. It outperformed comparative models across all datasets, as evidenced by its AUC, KS score, calibration, and DCA results.

In this prospective cross-sectional study, 62, 85, and 75 eyes of normal control group (NC), DM group, and NPDR group were included, respectively. All subjects received an optic-disc-centered 6 × 6-mm fundus scan. The annular region outside the optic disc boundary was divided into eight sectors: nasal superior, nasal inferior, inferior nasal (IN), inferior temporal (IT), temporal superior, temporal inferior, superior nasal, and superior temporal (ST). The average retinal nerve fiber layer thickness, average capillary density, and changes in thickness and capillary density of each sector in the annular region were calculated. Compared with the NC group, the average capillary density of pRNFL in patients with DM and NPDR groups decreased significantly (p < 0.001), and there were significant differences in capillary density in all sectors except the IN sector in the DM group. There was no significant difference in the average thickness of pRNFL between the groups. Only the thickness of ST and IT in DM group and NPDR group, respectively, were significantly lower than that in the control group. In addition, the ROC curve of pRNFL average capillary density has high sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing DR from healthy eyes (AUC = 0.852).

A cross-sectional study included 1243 T2DM patients over 45 years old. CI was assessed using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment. BMR and body composition indices were measured through bioelectrical impedance analysis. The associations and predictions related to CI were explored using multivariable-adjusted logistic regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) models, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Mediation analysis explored the role of BMR adjusted by body surface area (BMR/BSA) in CI risk. Patients with CI showed significantly lower BMR, BMR adjusted for height squared (BMR/Height²), BMR/BSA, appendicular skeletal muscle mass (ASM), and fat-free mass (FFM), alongside higher waist circumference (WC) and percentage of body fat. Logistic regression showed that participants in the fourth quartile of BMR, BMR/Height2, and BMR/BSA had approximately a 54% reduced risk of CI (odds ratio range 0.457 to 0.463). RCS analysis indicated a linear decrease in CI risk with increasing BMR metrics. ROC analysis indicated high predictive efficacy for CI with combined indicators, particularly BMR and FFM (area under the curve 0.645). Mediation analysis suggested that BMR/BSA played a significant mediating role in WC, ASM and FFM on CI risk, with a mediation proportion ranging from 45.73% to 50.87%. Low energy expenditure assessed by BMR/BSA is an independent risk factor for increased CI risk in middle-aged and elderly T2DM patients. Central obesity, low muscle mass, and low energy expenditure significantly elevate CI risk in this population.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

However, the clinical efficacy of weight-based LT4 dosing has been suboptimal, highlighting the need to identify factors influencing the attainment of desired TSH levels and guide personalized treatment. We constructed a retrospective cohort comprising 215 patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer. The identification of factors influencing the attainment of expected TSH levels was accomplished through univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. Subsequently, we developed a nomogram based on these prognostic factors and performed internal validation using the bootstrap resampling method. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to analyze the clinical and demographic parameters. A nomogram was constructed using bootstrap resampling to predict the risk of TSH suppression failure, which was validated. The nomogram demonstrated moderate discrimination in estimating the risk of TSH suppression failure, with a Hosmer-Lemeshow test p-value of 0.393 and a bootstrapped calibrated C-index of 0.757 (95% CI 0.687-0.814). The calibration curve indicated good consistency of the model, and decision curve analysis suggested that the nomogram had clinical utility. Gender, preoperative serum free thyroxine (FT4) levels, T stage, and body mass index exhibit independent associations with the expected level of TSH. The established nomogram effectively predicts the risk of TSH suppression failure.

An epigenetics-based Random Survival Forest (RSF) model was constructed using 801 curated epigenetic factors and validated in multiple independent cohorts. Our analysis revealed distinct epigenetic states in the OS microenvironment, with particular activity in OS cells and osteoclasts. The RSF model identified key predictive genes including OLFML2B, ACTB, and C1QB, and demonstrated broad applicability across multiple cancer types. Risk stratification analysis revealed distinct therapeutic response patterns, with low-risk groups showing enhanced sensitivity to traditional chemotherapy drugs while high-risk groups responded better to targeted therapies. Our epigenetics-based model demonstrates excellent prognostic accuracy (AUC>0.997 in internal validation, 0.832-0.929 in external cohorts) and provides a practical tool for treatment stratification.

In this study, we identified biomarkers for the MASLD dataset (GSE33814, GSE48452) and the T2DM dataset (GSE76895 and GSE89120) by bioinformatics analysis. Next, we constructed weighted gene co-expression network (WGCNA) for disease module analysis to screen out shared genes strongly associated with diseases. We also analyzed the enriched pathways of shared genes using Gene Ontology (GO) and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways. Next, hub gene validation was performed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Finally, we used RT-qPCR, immunofluorescence, Western blotting and Elisa to validate hub gene expression in MASLD and T2DM mouse models. This analysis identified 20 genes shared by MASLD and T2DM that were enriched in the bile secretion, phototransduction, cancer, carbohydrate digestion and absorption, cholesterol/glycerol metabolism, and retinol metabolism. The LASSO algorithm and ROC curve identified Retinol Dehydrogenase 10 (RDH10) as the best diagnostic gene for MASLD and T2DM. Immunofluorescence and Western blot showed that RDH10 expression was reduced in the liver and pancreatic islets of MASLD and T2DM model mice. Similarly, serum levels of RDH10 were significantly lower in MASLD and T2DM model mice and humans than in controls. Our study suggests that RDH10 is a common diagnostic marker for MASLD and T2DM and provides new research directions for the prevention and treatment of MASLD and T2DM.","2025","Frontiers in pharmacology"

This restricts the perception of local pathologic features and their relationships, causing semantic ambiguity and inefficiency of entity embedding. This study proposes a novel entity-level multiple instance learning. To realize entity-level augmentation, entity component mixup enhances the capture of relationships of contextually localized pathology features. To strengthen the semantic synergy of global and local pathological features, Bayesian collaborative learning is proposed to construct co-optimization of instance and bag embedding. Additionally, pathological prior transfer implement the initial optimization of the global attention pooling thereby fundamentally improving entity embedding. This study constructed a glomerular image dataset containing up to 23 types of lesion patterns. Intensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves the best on 19 out of 23 types, with AUC exceeding 90% and 95% on 20 and 11 types, respectively. Moreover, the proposed model achieves up to 18.9% and 14.7% improvements compared to the thumbnail-level and slide-level methods. Ablation study and visualization further reveals this method synergistically strengthens the feature representations under the condition of fewer instances. The proposed entity-level multiple instance learning enables accurate recognition of 23 types of lesion patterns, providing an effective tool for mesoscopic histopathology images classification. This proves it is capable of capturing salient pathologic features and contextual relationships from the fewer instances, which can be extended to classify other pathologic entities.","2025","Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society"

This study was conducted at a single institution. This study included 129 patients who conformed to the inclusion criteria. NACT with or without pembrolizumab for patients with LA-HPSCC. The ORR was analyzed according to the RECIST 1.1 criteria and a nomogram was developed based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and multivariable Cox regression analysis. Predictive accuracy and discriminative ability of the nomogram were evaluated by receiver operating characteristics, precision recall, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. Eighty-two patients received NACT and 47 also received pembrolizumab. ORR was higher in patients receiving additional pembrolizumab (66.0% vs 47.6%, χ2 = 4.074, P = .044). The nomogram identified pretreatment levels of lymphocytes and red blood cells as independent predictors of a high ORR, while basophil levels were an independent predictor of a low ORR. Calibration curve showed that the nomogram-based predictions corresponded well with actual observations. C-index of the nomogram was 0.925 (0.848-1.002) and the area under curve was 0.925. Decision curve analysis affirmed that the nomogram had important clinical value. Pembrolizumab could improve the ORR in LA-HPSCC patients treated with NACT.

Postmortem biochemistry is crucial in the assisted diagnosis of SCD in forensic medicine. We evaluated the expression levels of six sensitive biomarkers of myocardial injury in the training-set comprising 78 cases of acute ischemia (AI), 23 cases of acute myocardial infarction (MI), and 37 cases who died of high falls. The results showed that CK-MB, cTnI, BNP, LDH, and HBDH may be of great significance in diagnosing sudden death of AIHD. Among these, BNP, LDH, and HBDH are particularly useful for distinguishing between AI and acute MI. Using receiver operating analysis, we identified that the combination of five biomarkers-BNP, cTnI, CK-MB, LDH, and HBDH-achieved a significantly higher diagnostic accuracy for AIHD, with an AUC of 0.910. This combination outperformed the traditional three-biomarker combination (CK-MB, cTnI, BNP), which was considered highly accurate but only had an AUC of 0.857. Additionally, a three-biomarker combination (BNP, HBDH, and LDH) demonstrated clear advantages in differentiating between AI and acute MI, with an AUC of 0.794.

A prospective cohort study was conducted, enrolling 95 patients diagnosed with ES. They were divided into 2 groups: a control group (n = 62) and a refractory group (n = 33). Demographic and clinical data were collected at enrollment. Plasma NPY levels were measured in hospitalization. A receiver-operating characteristic curve was used to define an NPY threshold, with Youden's index applied to identify the optimal cutoff point for heightened mortality risk in patients with ES. According to NPY threshold, patients were divided into a low NPY group and a high NPY group. The log-rank test was used for Kaplan-Meier survival curve comparison between 2 groups. Cox proportional hazards modeling was used to assess the association between NPY level and mortality. Patients in the refractory group exhibited significantly higher venous NPY levels compared with those in the control group. Receiver-operating characteristic analysis identified an NPY threshold of 44.4 pg/mL with sensitivity of 0.91 and specificity of 0.90. Elevated baseline NPY levels were significantly associated with an increased risk for mortality in patients with ES (95% CI: 0.89-0.99).

A total of 2268 patients with T2DM were enrolled in this study. We collected the general clinical information of patients, measured the basic anthropometric indicators, tested glycolipid metabolism and biochemical indicators, and measured the visceral and subcutaneous fat area with bioelectrical impedance technology. According to the quartiles of the CVAI, the T2DM patients were classified into four groups: group A (CVAI ≤ 94.43), group B (94.43<CVAI ≤ 118.75), group C (118.75<CVAI ≤ 143.95), and group D (CVAI≥143.95), each group has 567 participants. Participants were divided into hyperuricemia (HUA) and non-HUA groups, and the clinical data between the two groups was compared. Among quartiles of CVAI, as CVAI increased, the proportion of patients with HUA gradually increased. The correlation analysis showed that the majority of basal measures, glycolipid metabolism and biochemical indicators were positively correlated with CVAI. By comparison, the level of CVAI in the HUA group was significantly higher than non-HUA group. Meanwhile, through using the ROC curve, our study observed the more predictive value of CVAI than other obesity indicators for T2DM with HUA. CVAI is a simple but effective indicator, which is significantly correlated with HUA in T2DM and can reflect the incidence of HUA in T2DM patients. As CVAI increased, the risk of HUA in T2DM patients increased. Therefore, we should pay more attention to the application of CVAI in T2DM.","2025","Frontiers in endocrinology"

""Admitted with a diagnosis of respiratory infectious disease"" (8.39) was identified as the most important factor in the model, followed by ""Hypoalbuminemia"" (7.83), then ""ESBL"" (7.06), ""Electrolyte Imbalance"" (5.81), ""Age > 62 years"" (5.24), ""The number of Positive Sputum Cultures for KP > 2"" (4.77), and being bedridden (4.24). Additionally, invasive procedures (such as history of tracheostomy, use of ventilators for >96 h, and craniotomy) were also significant predictive factors. The Nomogram indicated that CRKP, presence of a nasogastric tube, admission to the ICU, and history of tracheostomy were important factors in determining KP colonization. The Random Forest model effectively distinguishes between infection and colonization status of KP, while the Nomogram visually presents the predictive value of various factors, providing clinicians with a reference for formulating treatment plans. In the future, the accuracy of infection diagnosis can be further enhanced through artificial intelligence technology to optimize treatment strategies, thereby improving patient prognosis and reducing healthcare burdens.","2024","Frontiers in microbiology"

We aimed to assess the predictive ability of these parameters in patients with hepatitis B virus-related cirrhosis and overt hepatic encephalopathy (HBV-related OHE). We conducted an analysis of 1,404 participants diagnosed with HBV-related OHE between January 2008 and July 2023. The prognostic significance of the neutrophil-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (NHR), lymphocyte-to-HDL-C ratio (LHR), and monocyte-to-HDL-C ratio (MHR) was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Restrictive cubic splines (RCS) were employed to explore the relationship between NHR and 12-month transplant-free (TF) mortality. This study included a prospective test cohort of 328 patients. NHR was identified as an independent risk factor for 12-month TF mortality. The AUC for NHR (0.776) was similar to that of the model end-stage liver disease (MELD) score (AUC: 0.777). In the test cohort, NHR demonstrated AUC values comparable to MELD, with significantly higher AUCs than LHR and MHR (both p < 0.05). Based on cutoff values for NHR and MELD, patients were classified into four risk subgroups: very-low (NHR < 10 and MELD <18), low (NHR ≥ 10 and MELD <18), moderate (NHR < 10 and MELD ≥18), and high (NHR ≥ 10 and MELD ≥18). The 12-month TF mortality rates in the training cohort were 7.2, 23.5, 30.8, and 51.4%, respectively, for these subgroups, while in the test cohort, the rates were 8.7, 20.5, 30.7, and 46.0%. NHR is a valuable and accessible prognostic indicator for 12-month TF mortality in patients with HBV-related OHE. Patients with both NHR ≥ 10 and MELD ≥18 are at the highest risk of mortality.","2025","Frontiers in medicine"

This study aimed to assess the role of complement component fragment 5a (C5a) receptor 2 (C5aR2) in prognosis of patients with ARDS. A total of 64 adult patients diagnosed with ARDS were prospectively recruited to the study over a period of one year after obtaining the informed consent. The serum C5a and C5aR2were determined using ELISA Kit sandwich method. Area under receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) was used to analyse the prognostic performance of C5a, C5R2, and C5a/C5R2 ratio using MedCalc. The relationship of these biomarkers with the parameters of poor prognosis (non-recovery, hospitalization, ventilation and ICU admission) was analysed through regression using SPSSv20. The mean age of the included participants was 49.17 (SD:14.81) years. C5a/C5aR2 ratio had better discrimination (AUC: 0.707 vs 0.699 vs 0.511) and higher specificity (78.1 vs 71.9 vs 3.1) than C5R2 and C5a in predicting the poor prognosis among ARDS patients. The increased level of C5aR2 (OR: 0.225; p = 0.009) was significantly associated with better recovery and the high C5a/C5aR2 ratio (OR: 3.281; p = 0.036) was significantly associated with non-recovery in moderate to severe patients. Additionally, steroid treatment significantly associated with better recovery in patients with a high C5a/C5aR2 ratio (OR: 0.104; p = 0.007). The current evidence indicates that a higher levels of C5aR2 significantly associated with better recovery, whereas high levels of C5a/C5aR2 significantly associated to poor prognosis in moderate to severe ARDS patients. However, adequately powered studies are required to confirm these findings in future.","2025","Heliyon"

In this study, we aimed to investigate the potential prognostic value of mitophagy-related genes in PCOS patients and to analyze their role in immune infiltration during PCOS pathogenesis and progression. Training datasets were used for differential expression genes. Gene ontology annotations and Kyoto encyclopedia of genes and genomes signaling pathway enrichment analysis were performed. The potential biomarkers of mitophagy-related and immune infiltration in PCOS were screened by protein-protein interaction network using different algorithms, and the area under the curve was calculated to analyze their diagnostic value. The test datasets were used to validate the expression of hub genes, and receiver operating characteristic curves were used to evaluate the predictive effect of hub genes. Five hub genes: CTSD, IGF2R, ATP13A2, NAPA and GRN were identified as the potential diagnostic biomarkers of immune-mitophagy-related PCOS through five algorithms. GRN and NAPA were validated to be significantly different in oocytes and granulosa cells between primary and secondary follicles, respectively. Based on the single sample Gene Set Enrichment Analysis score, the infiltration of 4 immune cell types in PCOS was associated with PCOS and mitophagy. Specifically, the hub gene GRN showed a positive correlation with monocytes and plasmacytoid dendritic cells, while hub gene NAPA was negatively correlated with gamma delta T cell. The current study identified immune-mitophagy-related hub genes for prognostic biomarkers of PCOS, which provided an innovative insight for the prevention and treatment of PCOS.","2025","Heliyon"

This study aims to verify UHR's independent role in diabetes risk prediction in a large sample population and assess its applicability across different populations. We drew upon data from 30,813 participants collected during the 2005-2018 NHANES cycle. The association between UHR and the risk of diabetes was explored using multivariate logistic regression models, with key predictive factors identified through LASSO regression. Model effectiveness was evaluated through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration metrics. Additionally, restricted cubic spline (RCS) and threshold effect assessments were applied to examine the nonlinear association between UHR and diabetes risk. The results showed that UHR levels were notably elevated in individuals with diabetes when compared to those without diabetes (p < 0.001). The occurrence of diabetes showed a marked increase across ascending UHR quartiles (6.63%, 10.88%, 14.15%, 18.02%; p < 0.001). Results from multivariate logistic regression indicated that elevated UHR was strongly linked to a heightened risk of diabetes; participants in the highest UHR quartile were found to have nearly four times the risk compared to those in the lowest quartile (OR = 4.063, 95% CI: 3.536-4.669, p < 0.001). Subgroup analyses demonstrated that the predictive effect of UHR was more pronounced in females. Key variables selected via LASSO regression improved the model's performance. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis indicated an inflection point at UHR = 10; beyond this point, diabetes risk accelerated, and when UHR exceeded 18, the risk increased significantly (OR > 1). ROC curve analysis showed the baseline model (M1) had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.797, while the multivariable model (M4) after LASSO selection had an AUC of 0.789. Decision curve analysis and calibration curves validated the model's predictive ability and consistency. This study indicates that UHR may be an independent predictor of diabetes risk, showing a positive correlation with diabetes and a more pronounced predictive effect in females.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

Patients were divided into SSD and Normal groups based on the evaluation of the Delirium Rating Scale-revised-98 in the first 1-4 days postoperatively. Multivariate logistic regression was performed to determine the influencing factors, and subject operating characteristic curves were used to assess the predictive effect of risk factors for subsyndromal delirium. A total of 179 elderly pancreatic surgery patients were included in this study. 67 elderly patients developed subsyndromal delirium with an incidence of 37.43%. Multivariable Logistic regression revealed that risk factors for SSD included age, age-adjusted Charlson Comorbidity Index (aCCI), and postoperative fever, while and education level with senior high school or above was found to be protective factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that the combination of age and aCCI predicted SSD in elderly pancreatic surgery patients (Area Under Curve = 0.815, 95% Confidence Interval: 0.752 - 0.878), with sensitivity and specificity of 80.6% and 75.9%, respectively. The incidence of subsyndromal delirium after elderly pancreatic surgery was as high as 37.43%. Effective assessment and prevention of subsyndromal delirium are crucial.

Currently, a reliable predictive model for sICH risk after EVT is lacking. This study used data from patients aged ≥20 years who underwent EVT for anterior circulation stroke from the nationwide Taiwan Registry of Endovascular Thrombectomy for Acute Ischemic Stroke (TREAT-AIS). A predictive model including factors associated with an increased risk of sICH after EVT was developed to differentiate between patients with and without sICH. This model was compared existing predictive models using nationwide registry data to evaluate its relative performance. Of the 2,507 identified patients, 158 developed sICH after EVT. Factors such as diastolic blood pressure, Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score, platelet count, glucose level, collateral score, and successful reperfusion were associated with the risk of sICH after EVT. The TREAT-AIS score demonstrated acceptable predictive accuracy (area under the curve [AUC]=0.694), with higher scores being associated with an increased risk of sICH (odds ratio=2.01 per score increase, 95% confidence interval=1.64-2.45, P<0.001). The discriminatory capacity of the score was similar in patients with symptom onset beyond 6 hours (AUC=0.705). Compared to existing models, the TREAT-AIS score consistently exhibited superior predictive accuracy, although this difference was marginal. s The TREAT-AIS score outperformed existing models, and demonstrated an acceptable discriminatory capacity for distinguishing patients according to sICH risk levels. However, the differences between models were only marginal. Further research incorporating periprocedural and postprocedural factors is required to improve the predictive accuracy.","2025","Journal of stroke"

Detailed patient information was collected, including height, weight, age, AWETA, history of recent prolonged exercise, and tibial measurements. Data were analyzed using appropriate statistical tests to determine between-group differences, and binary logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors and develop a predictive model. Body weight, BMI, AWETA, anteroposterior tibial plateau diameter, anterior tibial bowing angle, and gender showed significant differences between the SF and control groups. Logistic regression identified BMI (OR = 7.39, 95 % CI: 1.89-28.86), AWETA (OR = 0.54, 95 % CI: 0.46-0.62), and anterior tibial bowing angle (OR = 0.44, 95 % CI: 0.33-0.58) as independent predictors of tibial SF. The model demonstrated high predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.916, sensitivity of 93.9 %, and specificity of 89.4 %.

Interictal EEG data were used for feature extraction, identifying 216 EEG network features. Traditional machine learning and ensemble learning techniques were employed to predict DRE outcomes. Over two years, TLE patients with DRE exhibited significant EEG differences, particularly in frontotemporal θ-band networks, characterized by increased connectivity metrics such as phase lag index (P = 0.000), etc. The predictive algorithm based on EEG features achieved accuracies between 59.2 %-84.6 % (AUC: 0.60-0.87). When compared to the whole brain, EEG features of the frontotemporal network showed improved classification performance in Naïve Bayes (P = 0.032), Tree Bagger (P = 0.021), and Subspace Discriminant (P = 0.022) models. The ensemble learning technique (Tree Bagger) delivered the best prediction results, achieving 91.5 % accuracy, 97 % sensitivity, 81 % specificity, and AUC of 0.92. Increased frontotemporal EEG connectivity was observed in TLE patients with 2-year DRE. A predictive model based on routine EEG provides an accessible method for forecasting ASMs efficacy.

Exploring the efficacy of transfer learning across domain boundaries.","In medical deep learning, models not trained from scratch are typically fine-tuned based on ImageNet-pretrained models. We posit that pretraining on data from the domain of the downstream task should almost always be preferable. We leverage RadNet-12M and RadNet-1.28M, datasets containing >12 million/1.28 million acquired CT image slices from 90,663 individual scans, and explore the efficacy of self-supervised, contrastive pretraining on the medical and natural image domains. We compare the respective performance gains for five downstream tasks. For each experiment, we report accuracy, AUC, or DICE score and uncertainty estimations based on four separate runs. We quantify significance using Welch's t-test. Finally, we perform feature space analysis to characterize the nature of the observed performance gains. We observe that intra-domain transfer (RadNet pretraining and CT-based tasks) compares favorably to cross-domain transfer (ImageNet pretraining and CT-based tasks), generally achieving comparable or improved performance - Δ = +0.44% (p = 0.541) when fine-tuned on RadNet-1.28M, Δ = +2.07% (p = 0.025) when linearly evaluating on RadNet-1.28M, and Δ = +1.63% (p = 0.114) when fine-tuning on 1 % of RadNet-1.28M data. This intra-domain advantage extends to LiTS 2017, another CT-based dataset, but not to other medical imaging modalities. A corresponding intra-domain advantage was also observed for natural images. Outside the CT image domain, ImageNet-pretrained models generalized better than RadNet-pretrained models. We further demonstrate that pretraining on medical images yields domain-specific features that are preserved during fine-tuning, and which correspond to macroscopic image properties and structures. We conclude that intra-domain pretraining generally outperforms cross-domain pretraining, but that very narrow domain definitions apply. Put simply, pretraining on CT images instead of natural images yields an advantage when fine-tuning on CT images, and only on CT images. We further conclude that ImageNet pretraining remains a strong baseline, as well as the best choice for pretraining if only insufficient data from the target domain is available. Finally, we publish our pretrained models and pretraining guidelines as a baseline for future research.","2025","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

This retrospective study enrolled 2,306 patients. The Cox proportional hazards model was utilized to evaluate the association between the four TyG indicators and major adverse cardiovascular and cerebrovascular events (MACCE). The predictive ability of the four TyG indicators for MACCE was assessed using the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was employed to assess the prognostic differences among groups. After a median follow-up of 26.1 months, a total of 352 patients (15.3%) experienced MACCE. The Cox regression analysis revealed that under a fully adjusted model, when the four TyG indicators were stratified by tertiles, patients in the highest tertile of each TyG indicator had a significantly increased risk of MACCE compared to those in the lowest tertile. Specifically, the hazard ratio for baseline TyG index was 1.653 (95% confidence intervals (CI): 1.234-2.214), for baseline TyG-BMI was 2.467 (95%CI: 1.849-3.293), for mean TyG index was 2.451 (95%CI: 1.794-3.349), and for TyG-SD was 1.896 (95%CI: 1.430-2.513). Time-dependent ROC curve demonstrated that the mean TyG index had the strongest predictive ability for MACCE at each follow-up time point. The Kaplan-Meier analysis results showed that when the four TyG indicators were grouped by tertiles, there were significant differences in the cumulative incidence of MACCE among the three groups for each indicator (P < 0.05). Higher levels of the TyG index and its derived indicators were each independently and positively associated with the risk of MACCE in SCAD patients undergoing PCI. Among these indicators, the mean TyG index demonstrated the greatest predictive value for the risk of MACCE at each follow-up time point. Consequently, tracking the long-term trends of the TyG index may be prioritized in clinical practice.","2025","Frontiers in endocrinology"

Participants were categorized into NAFLD and non-NAFLD groups based on the results of ultrasonographic diagnosis. The relationship between SPISE and NAFLD was analyzed separately for each gender. The overall prevalence of NAFLD is 38.5%. In females and males, the SPISE was significantly reduced in the NAFLD group compared to the non-NAFLD group (both P < 0.05). The prevalence of NAFLD showed a significant reduction across quartiles of the SPISE in both genders (both P < 0.05).Additionally, univariate correlation analysis showed a negative correlation between SPISE and NAFLD (both P < 0.05). In multivariate regression analysis, a reduced SPISE was identified as an independent risk factor for NAFLD (odds ratios of 0.572 and 0.737, 95% CI of 0.477-0.687 and 0.587-0.926, respectively).Moreover, the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for SPISE was 0.209 in females and 0.268 in males (95% CI of 0.175-0.244 and 0.216-0.320, respectively). These results are more meaningful than those of other variables. SPISE is significantly reduced in NAFLD patients with T2D.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data from 2007 to 2018 were utilized, comprising 27,560 participants. To assess the association and discriminative ability of novel anthropometric indices, including the Body Roundness Index (BRI), A Body Shape Index (ABSI), Waist-to-Weight Index (WWI), and Relative Fat Mass (RFM), with OAB, we employed multivariable logistic regression, restricted cubic spline (RCS) analysis, subgroup analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve methods. Multivariable logistic regression analysis indicated that higher levels of novel anthropometric indices were positively associated with OAB prevalence. One z-score increase in WWI, BRI, RFM, and ABSI was associated with a 16, 31, 57, and 5% higher likelihood of OAB, respectively. RCS analysis revealed a non-linear relationship between RFM and OAB.

The optimal cutoff value for accurately identifying cats with long-term IRIS stage IV was a US-CKD score > 7, with a specificity of 98%, a sensitivity of 25%, and a positive likelihood ratio of 12.75. No preoperative US parameters regarding the obstructed kidney, including parenchymal and pelvic areas, were significantly associated with long-term creatinine. Ultrasonographic scoring of contralateral chronic kidney disease abnormalities is associated with IRIS stage following treatment of feline unilateral UO with a SUB device and serves as a specific indicator of cats presenting with long-term IRIS stage IV.","2025","Frontiers in veterinary science"

However, the optimal timing for CRRT initiation remains controversial. Using the MIMIC-IV database for model development and the eICU database for external validation, we analyzed patients with S-AKI to compare survival rates between early and late CRRT initiation groups. Propensity score matching was performed to address potential selection bias. Subgroup analyses stratified patients by disease severity using SOFA scores (low ≤10, medium 11-15, high >15) and creatinine levels (low ≤3 mg/dL, medium 3-5 mg/dL, high >5 mg/dL). Multiple machine learning models were developed and evaluated to predict patient prognosis, with Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis identifying key prognostic factors. After propensity score matching, late CRRT initiation was associated with improved survival probability, but led to increased hospital and ICU stays. Subgroup analyses showed consistent trends favoring late CRRT across all SOFA categories, with the most pronounced effect in high SOFA scores (>15, p = 0.058). The GBM model demonstrated robust predictive performance (average C-index 0.694 in validation and test sets). SHAP analysis identified maximum lactate levels, age, and minimum SpO2 as the strongest predictors of mortality, while CRRT timing showed relatively lower impact on outcome prediction. While later initiation of CRRT in S-AKI patients was associated with improved survival, this benefit comes with increased healthcare resource utilization. The clinical parameters, rather than CRRT timing, are the primary determinants of patient outcomes, suggesting the need for a more personalized approach to CRRT initiation based on overall illness severity.","2024","Frontiers in medicine"

The amplitude of low-frequency fluctuation (ALFF) method was used to observe changes in spontaneous brain activity, which may help to investigate the underlying pathological mechanism of AMD. Eighteen patients with wAMD and 18 age- and gender-matched healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. The ALFF method was used on each subject and mean ALFF values were compared between groups. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare the two groups. ALFF values in the temporal lobe and limbic lobe/parahippocampal gyrus were significantly higher than controls, while values in the postcentral gyrus were significantly lower. The under the curve of the ROC (AUC) of the three regions shows high accuracy of the diagnosis. The abnormal spontaneous brain activity of patients with AMD suggests scope for the use of ALFF in the diagnosis or prognosis in AMD.","2024","Frontiers in medicine"

This study aims to evaluate the potential value of CDK1 and STAT1 in the diagnosis of AKI in this patient population. A retrospective analysis was conducted on adjacent tissue, cancerous and the clinical data tissue from 150 gastrointestinal cancer patients treated at our hospital from May 2022 to May 2023. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with gastrointestinal cancer and kidney injury were identified through bioinformatics analysis. The expression of DEGs proteins in cancerous and adjacent tissues was assessed using immunohistochemical scoring (H scores). Patients were classified into AKI (n = 42) and non-AKI groups (n = 108) according to KDIGO AKI criteria. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed to investigate the influencing factors of AKI occurrence. Spearman correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between DEGs and AKI biomarkers (Scr, BUN, MAU, and UA). The application value of DEGs in early diagnosis of AKI was evaluated using ROC curves. Bioinformatics analysis identified CDK1, STAT1, COL1A2, and COL1A1 as DEGs related to AKI in gastrointestinal cancer. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed elevated H scores for CDK1, STAT1, COL1A2, and COL1A1 in tumor tissues. Univariate analysis showed no significant differences in age, sex, marital status, education level, monthly income, disease type, cancer stage, or tumor markers (CEA, CA242, CA50) between AKI and non-AKI groups (P > 0.05). However, the AKI group exhibited significantly higher levels of MAU, UA, and H scores for CDK1, STAT1, COL1A2, and COL1A1 compared to the non-AKI group (P < 0.05). Multivariate logistic regression confirmed that MAU, UA, CDK1, and STAT1 are independent risk factors for AKI in gastrointestinal cancer patients. Correlation analysis indicated a significant positive association between CDK1, STAT1, and AKI biomarker levels (P < 0.05). ROC curve analysis demonstrated that CDK1 and STAT1 possess high diagnostic value for early detection of AKI in patients with gastrointestinal cancer, with enhanced efficacy when used in combination. CDK1 and STAT1 serve as early diagnostic indicators for the occurrence of AKI in gastrointestinal cancer patients.","2025","Frontiers in molecular biosciences"

According to the relationship between tumour origin and ON course, different ""vectors of compression"" can be identified: lateral-to-medial, medial-to-lateral, inferior-to-superior, and anterior-to-posterior. As visual function preservation represents the main goal of surgery, we designed a procedural algorithm concerning approach, cisterns dissection, falciform ligament section, ON mobilization and tumour debulking aimed to reduce ONs manipulation during surgery. We included 40 patients harbouring meningiomas compressing ONs with mean age 61.7 ± 12.4 years. Sixteen originated from anterior clinoidal process (40%), 10 from sphenoid-ethmoidal planum (27.5%), 10 from tuberculum sellae (25%), and 4 from sphenoid-orbital region (7.5%). A decline in visual acuity was observed in 34/40 (85%) of patients and in visual field in 28/40 (70%). Mean age appeared significantly lower in patients with intact visual field (p = 0.006). No differences were observed between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients according to tumour origin, whereas a significantly lower rate of visual field impairment was observed among patients with inferior-to-superior compression. On the contrary, tumour determining a superior-to-inferior compression showed a trend of higher risk of visual field cut. Falciform ligament opening was performed in 82.5% of cases, optic canal unroofing in 27%, anterior clinoidectomy in 32% and optic strut removal in 5%. At 6-month follow-up, none among patients treated before of visual acuity onset disturbances showed worsening. Among those showing preoperative alterations, an improvement was observed in 17/34 (50%), 14 (41.2%) had an unchanged deficit, and 3 (8.8%) a worsening. Optic canal unroofing was the only significant predictor of postoperative non-improvement at multivariate analysis (p = 0.03, AUC = 0.796; OR = 0.163; 95%CI:0.027-0.983; p = 0.04). Similarly, none patient developed visual field cut when treated before it clinical appearance, and only 28.6% of those with a pre-operative deficit showed post-operative improvement. Worsening was seen in 5/28 of patients with a preoperative visual field deficit (17.6%), with the remaining 15 (53.6%) with unchanged visual field at 6-month. Comparing patients with post-operative visual field improvement and non-improvement, only a younger age and a better preoperative mRS status showed a significant association with a positive outcome. Age emerged as unique significant risk factor for lack of post-operative improvement at stepwise binomial logistic regression model (OR = 0.855, 95%CI: 0.743-0.983, p = 0.028). The surgical management of anterior cranial fossa meningiomas associated with optic nerve compression should prioritize visual preservation over radical tumor resection and a timely decompression reducing the risk of post-operative visual acuity deterioration. The surgical techniques should be also modified to include all the necessary unlocking strategies limiting the ON stress during the tumor manipulation.","2025","Neurosurgical review"

While WC is widely used for central obesity measurement, its accuracy needs improvement. This study aims to investigate whether SAD has advantages over WC in diagnosing central obesity and to determine the optimal cut-off values for diagnosis. This cross-sectional, retrospective cohort study analyzed 6762 individuals from NHANES (2011-2016) and 701 from Chinese health examinations (2023). ROC curve analysis compared AUC of different indicators in identifying two or more non-adipose components of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). SAD exhibited the strongest correlation with VFA and demonstrated the strongest associations with most metabolic parameters compared to WC and BMI. Furthermore, compared with WC, SAD had significantly higher AUC values in diagnosing two or more non-adipose components of MetS, with the difference being significant in the NHANES database population (all p < 0.001). The optimal SAD cut-off value was approximately 21.0 cm for both genders and populations, with MetS prevalence increasing rapidly at SAD≥22.0 cm. Subgroup analysis of NHANES revealed variations in optimal SAD cut-off values: Other Races (23.7 cm), Non-Hispanic Black females (18.8 cm), and other subgroups (20.0-22.0 cm). SAD demonstrates higher efficacy than WC in diagnosing central obesity, suggesting its suitability for assessing central obesity.

Non-contrast abdominal CT scans of 1,000 healthy subjects from three medical institutions (from four manufacturers and eight different models) were retrospectively included: Hospital A (n = 513), Hospital B (n = 338), and Hospital C (n = 149). 93 radiomics features were extracted from liver and spleen tissues using PyRadiomics. Performing a binary classification task of liver and spleen tissues on the pooled data from the three institutions: (1) Unharmonized, (2) ComBat, and (3) CovBat. Models were built separately for each radiomics feature classes (First-order, GLCM, GLRLM, GLSZM, NGTD, GLDM), as well as a combined model integrating all feature classes. The Kruskal-Wallis test and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to assess the variability of radiomics features among the groups. Multiple linear regression models were used to analyze the sources of variation. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate model performance. After ComBat and CovBat harmonization, the number of consistent features increased by 68.82 % and 73.12 %, respectively, and the feature variability due to hardware differences decreased from 12.32-25.38 % to 1.89-2.01 % with ComBat and 1.19-1.88 % with CovBat. The AUC of the machine learning models improved significantly: Combined (Unharmonized: 0.93, ComBat: 0.99, CovBat: 1.00), First-order (0.93, 0.98, 0.98), GLCM (0.81, 0.93, 0.98), GLRLM (0.78, 0.96, 0.98), NGTDM (0.75, 0.96, 0.98), GLSZM (0.78, 0.93, 0.97), and GLDM (0.83, 0.94, 0.97). DeLong's test showed that the results before and after harmonization were statistically significant (P < 0.05).

To justify the initial model behind the supplement safety screener (S3) algorithm which predicts whether athletes will use TPT supplements, a cross-validation was performed using this independent dataset based on responses of a large group of collegiate NCAA DI athletes. Additionally, explorative modeling using stepwise logistic regression was used to identify new predictors for TPT supplement use to create and evaluate a new model for future use. The S3 algorithm was applied to the responses from n = 662 athletes using supplements (age: 20 ± 1.5 years, 50% female, from >24 sports) confirming that the algorithm identifies consistent and inconsistent TPT users (χ2 (1) = 15.95, p < 0.001), with a moderate area under the curve (AUC, 0.67) and a moderate specificity (68%), but low sensitivity (51%). Explorative modeling identified two new variables: TPT logo recognition, and having at least one name, image, likeness (NIL) deal that may help to predict TPT supplement use. Strong relationships between risk groupings and product use outcomes toward TPT supplement use were identified for the athletes screened. The S3 screener showed high sensitivity for identifying student-athletes inconsistently using TPT supplements, but a low specificity, lacking the ability to place less risky athletes into low-risk quadrants. The exploratory modeling, identifying TPT logo recognition and having a NIL deal, further strengthens our knowledge on predictors for consistent TPT supplement use.","2024","Frontiers in nutrition"

The rat AGA model was established by injection of Monosodium urate (MSU) crystals. The rats were randomly divided into 6 groups (A: control group, B: model control group, C: cavitation group, D: high dose colchicine group, E: cavitation + low dose colchicine group, F: cavitation + high dose colchicine group) according to whether they were given cavitation and different doses of colchicine. The effect of cavitation on blood perfusion was analyzed by comparing contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and the area under the curve (AUC) of CEUS with the ankle joint of right hind limb. The AGA symptoms were assessed by referring to the degree of ankle joint swelling within 24 h and the gait score. The infiltration of neutrophils was determined using the hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining method. For the evaluation of vascular inflammation and dilation, plasma interleukin-1β (IL-1β) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) served as the key indicators. Besides, the severity of gastrointestinal adverse reactions is determined by analyzing the gastrointestinal reaction scores. When compared with groups A, B, and D, the AUC was markedly higher in groups C, E, and F (all P < 0.05). In groups E and F, the degree of ankle swelling, gait scores, and the level of plasma IL-1β in AGA rats were lower, while the concentration of plasma eNOS was higher compared to the group D (all P < 0.05). HE staining findings demonstrated that the integration of cavitation and colchicine played a positive role in reducing neutrophil infiltration in the ankle joint synovium and mitigating the gastrointestinal reaction score in AGA rats. In contrast to groups D, E, and F that were given colchicine, group E had a substantially lower gastrointestinal reaction score, with statistically significant differences observed in pairwise comparisons (all P < 0.05). In rats with AGA, cavitation generated by USMB exerted a remarkable effect on augmenting the blood perfusion of the ankle joint. This, in turn, not only amplified the anti-gout efficacy of colchicine but also reduced the dosage of colchicine. Concurrently, it effectively mitigated the associated gastrointestinal side effects.","2025","Heliyon"

We reviewed the voice data and clinical information of 350 individuals: 189 pathologically confirmed lung cancer patients and 161 non-lung cancer patients, which included 77 patients with benign pulmonary lesions and 84 healthy volunteers. First, acoustic features were extracted from all participants, and optimal features were selected by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. Subsequently, by integrating acoustic features and clinical features, a nomogram for predicting lung cancer was developed using a multivariate logistic regression model. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and the calibration curve. The clinical utility was estimated by decision curve analysis (DCA) to confirm the predictive value of the nomogram. Furthermore, the nomogram model was compared with predictive models that were developed using six additional machine-learning (ML) methods. Our acoustic-clinical nomogram model demonstrated a strong discriminative ability, with AUCs of 0.774 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.716-0.832) and 0.714 (95% CI: 0.616-0.811) in the training and test sets, respectively. The nomogram achieved an accuracy of 0.642, a sensitivity of 0.673, and a specificity of 0.611 in the test set. The calibration curve showed excellent agreement between the predicted and actual values, and the DCA curve underscored the clinical usefulness of our nomogram. Notably, our nomogram model outperformed other models in terms of AUC, accuracy, and specificity. The acoustic-clinical nomogram developed in this study demonstrates robust discrimination, calibration, and clinical application value. This nomogram, a unique contribution to the field, provides a reliable tool for predicting lung cancer.","2025","Frontiers in medicine"

The hypoxia group of chronic liver disease consisted of eight rats induced by injection of CCl4 and the control group consisted of nine rats injected with pure olive oil. All 17 rats underwent MRI examination at week 13 after injection, using T1 mapping and IVIM. Liver specimens were subjected to immunohistochemical staining for the exogenous hypoxia marker pimonidazole and the endogenous hypoxia marker HIF-1α and scored semi-quantitatively. Differences in MRI multiparameters, pimonidazole H-scores, and HIF-1α were analyzed between the control and hypoxia groups. Correlations between MRI multiparameters and H-score, and MRI multiparameters and HIF-1α, were analyzed, and the diagnostic performance of multiparameter MRI was evaluated by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. There were significant differences between the control group and the hypoxia group in D* values (p = 0.01) and f values (p = 0.025) of IVIM parameters, T1 mapping (p = 0.003), HIF-1α (p < 0.001) and pimonidazole scores (p = 0.004).

This is a retrospective cohort study identifying adult subjects with isolated ZA fractures presenting to the emergency department between September 2011 and October 2022. Subjects with non-ZA zygomaticomaxillary complex fractures or concurrent facial fractures were excluded. The predictor is maximal fracture displacement in centimeters measured on axial computed tomography imaging. The main outcome variable is operative management defined as recommendation of operative versus nonoperative intervention. Covariates collected include patient demographics; consisting of age, sex, past medical history (hypertension and diabetes); injury mechanism; social history (tobacco and alcohol use); presenting signs and symptoms (trismus, facial swelling, paresthesias, malar depression, and bony-step offs). Native overlying soft-tissue thickness was also measured on computed tomography imaging. Bivariate and multivariate statistical analyses were used to investigate differences between nonoperative and operative groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve was utilized to determine the discriminative fracture displacement for operative intervention. All statistical tests were performed with a significance level set at P < .05. The sample was composed of 86 subjects with an average age of 47.0 ± 19.1 years old. The mean fracture displacement was 0.29 ± 0.21 cm. Overall, 22 (25.6%) subjects were recommended operative intervention while 64 (74.4%) were managed nonoperatively. On bivariate analysis, mean fracture displacement was higher in the operative (0.51 ± 0.14 cm) versus nonoperative groups (0.21 ± 0.18 cm, P < .001).

Prospective concurrent validity study. Seventy-six preterm children born before 32 weeks' gestational age were concurrently assessed at corrected ages of 9 to 30 months using the DF-MOT and the Bayley-III. Validation of the DF-MOT involved a three-step process: (1) raw and standardized scores correlation analysis, (2) receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to assess diagnostic accuracy, and (3) diagnostic properties analysis for the primary DF-MOT cut-offs. Correlation analysis demonstrated very strong correlation for both gross and fine motor raw scores (r = 0.95 and 0.94, respectively), and strong to weak correlation for the standardized scores (ρ = 0.66 and 0.28, respectively). The DF-MOT gross motor subscale (DF-MOT/PML) exhibited excellent diagnostic accuracy on the ROC curve analysis and good diagnostic properties at -1 standard deviation, while the fine motor subscale (DF-MOT/EHGC) appeared to be less accurate in diagnosing delay with the Bayley-III. This disparity in fine motor evaluation seems to be linked to the DF-MOT/EHGC's greater sensitivity to identify fine motor delays.

Several serological methods are available to support the diagnosis of canine leishmaniosis. The immunofluorescence antibody test (IFAT) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) are the main tests used by clinicians. High antibody levels are associated with severe parasitism and disease and are diagnostic of clinical leishmaniosis. Conversely, the presence of low antibody levels is not necessarily indicative of disease and may be more difficult to detect by serological tests. The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the diagnostic performance of four commercially available serological tests, including ELISAs (CIVTEST® CANIS LEISHMANIA short and standard protocols), LEISHMANIA-ELISA DOG®, ELISA/S7® and MegaFLUO®LEISH IFAT, for the detection of specific antibodies against L. infantum antigens in dogs in different states of infection.

Enabling the prediction of individual trajectories would facilitate tailored management approaches for these individuals. This study used machine learning techniques to predict the recovery of GAD at a nine-year follow-up. The study involved 126 participants with GAD. Various baseline predictors from psychological, social, biological, sociodemographic and health variables were used. Two machine learning models, gradient boosted trees, and elastic nets were compared to predict the clinical course in participants with GAD. At nine-year follow-up, 95 participants (75.40 %) recovered. Elastic nets achieved a cross-validated area-under-the-receiving-operator-characteristic-curve (AUC) of .81 and a balanced accuracy of 72 % (sensitivity of .70 and specificity of .76). The elastic net algorithm revealed that the following factors were highly predictive of nonrecovery at follow-up: higher depressed affect, experiencing daily discrimination, more mental health professional visits, and more medical professional visits. The following variables predicted recovery: having some college education or higher, older age, more friend support, higher waist-to-hip ratio, and higher positive affect. There was acceptable performance in predicting recovery or nonrecovery at a nine-year follow-up. This study advances research on GAD outcomes by understanding predictors associated with recovery or nonrecovery. Findings can potentially inform more targeted preventive interventions, ultimately improving care for individuals with GAD. This work is a critical first step toward developing reliable and feasible machine learning-based predictions for applications to GAD.","2025","Journal of anxiety disorders"

However, the underlying pathogenic genes and effective treatment for EMS remain unclear. Therefore, this study aims to identify key genes influencing the diagnosis and treatment of EMS. The GSE7307 dataset, comprising 18 EMS and 23 control samples, was obtained from the GEO database. Fourteen differential genes related to NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) activation and EMS were extracted from endometrial samples in GSE7307 through differential analysis. GO and KEGG analyses revealed that these genes were primarily involved in the production and regulation of the cytokine IL-1β and the NOD-like receptor signaling pathway. Random Forest (RF) and support vector machine recursive feature elimination algorithms were employed to select four diagnostic markers related to NLRP3 activation (NLRP3, IL-1β, LY96, and PDIA3) for constructing the EMS diagnostic model. These markers were validated using western blotting and tested in GSE7305 and GSE23339 datasets. The AUC values demonstrated the model's robust diagnostic performance. Additionally, the infiltration of immune cells in the samples and the correlation between different immune factors and diagnostic markers were explored. These results suggest that the four diagnostic markers may also play a crucial role in EMS immunity. Finally, the DrugBank database indicated that niclosamide could be effective for NLRP3-targeted therapy. In conclusion, we identified four key diagnostic genes for EMS, and niclosamide emerged as a potential drug for NLRP3-targeted therapy in EMS.","2025","Journal of reproductive immunology"

The severity of calcification increases the risk of future target lesion revascularization (TLR). This study was conducted to determine whether calcification severity in the adjacent zone is associated with TLR. We analyzed 204 patients who received PCI for de-novo CN using intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). The calcium volume index (CVI) was calculated for each 1-mm cross-sectional frame in both the CN and adjacent zones. TLR occurred in 63 patients (30.9 %) during a median follow-up period of 2.8 years (interquartile range, 2.4-3.2). CVIs in both the CN and adjacent zones, along with minimum lumen area (MLA) after PCI, were significant predictors of TLR. The ROC curve-derived values for the CVIs in the CN and adjacent zones (10.52 and 5.33, respectively) and the MLA after PCI (6.65 mm2) were associated with higher TLR incidence. Among those requiring TLR, 27.0 % experienced multiple TLRs, with higher CVIs associated with recurrence. In a multi-state model, CVIs in both the CN and adjacent zones were significantly associated with the first TLR (no TLR as reference) and the second TLR (first TLR as reference). The CVI in the adjacent zone showed a higher hazard ratio for the second TLR (1.31; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.16-1.48) compared to the first TLR (1.12; 95 % CI: 1.07-1.17). Our findings highlight the importance of not only the calcification severity in the CN zone, but also in the adjacent zones, for TLR.","2025","Atherosclerosis"

However, the effect of a lower serum 25(OH)D level on new vertebral fractures, including osteoporotic vertebral refractures and cascade vertebral fractures post percutaneous vertebral augmentation in patients during postmenopause has not been reported. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between serum 25(OH)D and the risk of osteoporotic vertebral refractures and cascade vertebral fractures. A retrospective case-control study. This study took place at the Department of Spinal Surgery at a hospital affiliated with a medical university. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data from patients during postmenopause aged >= 50 years who underwent percutaneous vertebral augmentation. The patients were categorized into a nonrefracture group, an osteoporotic vertebral refractures group, and a cascade vertebral fractures group. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis models were employed to assess the effect of 25(OH)D on osteoporotic vertebral refractures and cascade vertebral fractures, while a receiver operating characteristic curve was used to evaluate its predictive value. A total of 528 patients were included in this study. Of these, 163 patients (30.9%) developed new vertebral fractures, with 124 (23.5%) classified as osteoporotic vertebral refractures and 39 (7.4%) as cascade vertebral fractures. The 25(OH)D levels were significantly lower in the new vertebral fracture group. Multivariate logistic regression analysis confirmed that an increase in 25(OH)D levels was protective against osteoporotic vertebral refractures occuring, including cascade vertebral fractures post percutaneous vertebral augmentation, even after adjusting for other potential confounding factors. A Pearson correlation analysis indicated a close relationship between vitamin D levels and L3 paraspinal muscle density and L3 bone mineral density in the enrolled patients with osteoporotic vertebral fractures (P < 0.05). A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated an area under the curve of 0.751 for 25(OH)D levels in predicting the risk of osteoporotic vertebral refractures (cut-off value, 27.5 ng/mL; sensitivity, 62.74%; specificity, 72.60%; P = 0.001) and 0.831 for cascade vertebral fractures (cut-off value, 19.5 ng/mL, sensitivity, 56.41%; specificity, 97.53%; P = 0.001), respectively. This retrospective study was conducted at a single center with a limited number of patients during postmenopause who had prior percutaneous vertebral augmentation,  especially those that developed recurrent fractures. A low serum 25(OH)D level is an independent risk factor for new vertebral fractures after percutaneous vertebral augmentation in patients during postmenopause. Appropriate active vitamin D supplementation following percutaneous vertebral augmentation surgery can effectively mitigate the risk of subsequent osteoporotic vertebral fractures.","2025","Pain physician"

This study quantifies the number and diameter of PNI foci to assess their prognostic relevance in OSCC. To evaluate the prognostic significance of PNI subcategories, specifically the number and diameter of PNI foci, as predictors of overall survival (OS) and disease-free survival (DFS) in OSCC patients. Retrospective cohort study, adhering to STROBE guidelines. Single-center study at MacKay Memorial Hospital, Taiwan, including patients diagnosed with OSCC from 2005 to 2018. Nine hundred twenty-six patients with biopsy-proven OSCC, excluding those with perioperative mortality or incomplete follow-up. Histological evaluation of PNI, including quantifying the number and diameter of invaded nerves, along with clinicopathological features such as tumor stage and lymphovascular invasion (LVI). OS and DFS, assessed via Cox proportional hazards models, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis for PNI foci subcategories. PNI was present in 138 (14.9%) patients and was significantly associated with adverse histologic features, advanced tumor stage, nodal involvement, metastasis, and LVI. Multivariate analysis revealed that both the number of PNI foci greater than 4 and nerve diameters exceeding 0.21 mm were significantly associated with poorer OS and DFS (P < .05). After adjusting for clinical variables, PNI remained an independent predictor of worse OS [hazard ratio (HR): 1.37] and DFS (HR: 1.46). PNI is a significant independent prognostic factor in OSCC. Patients with more than 4 PNI foci or nerve involvement greater than 0.21 mm in diameter experienced significantly worse survival outcomes. These findings suggest that detailed assessment of PNI subcategories should be incorporated into OSCC management, guiding treatment decisions and potentially informing the need for adjuvant therapies.","2025","Journal of otolaryngology - head & neck surgery = Le Journal d'oto-rhino-laryngologie et de chirurgie cervico-faciale"

Data acquisition (to achieve high coverage and efficiency) and analysis (to pursue good classification) are two key segments involved in metabolomics workflows. Various chemometric approaches utilizing either pattern recognition or machine learning have been employed to separate different groups. However, insufficient feature extraction, inappropriate feature selection, overfitting, or underfitting lead to an insufficient capacity to discriminate plants that are often easily confused. Using two ginseng varieties, namely Panax japonicus (PJ) and Panax japonicus var. major (PJvm), containing the similar ginsenosides, we integrated pseudo-targeted metabolomics and deep neural network (DNN) modeling to achieve accurate species differentiation. A pseudo-targeted metabolomics approach was optimized through data acquisition mode, ion pairs generation, comparison between multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) and scheduled MRM (sMRM), and chromatographic elution gradient. In total, 1980 ion pairs were monitored within 23 min, allowing for the most comprehensive ginseng metabolome analysis. The established DNN model demonstrated excellent classification performance (in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, area under the curve, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC)) using the entire metabolome data and feature-selection dataset, exhibiting superior advantages over random forest (RF), support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and multilayer perceptron (MLP). Moreover, DNNs were advantageous for automated feature learning, nonlinear modeling, adaptability, and generalization. This study confirmed practicality of the established strategy for efficient metabolomics data analysis and reliable classification performance even when using small-volume samples. This established approach holds promise for plant metabolomics and is not limited to ginseng.","2025","Journal of pharmaceutical analysis"

The magnitude of risk prediction and predictive efficacy of TyG-BMI for T2DM with NAFLD remains unclear. To examine the association of TyG-BMI with NAFLD in T2DM patients and assess the effectiveness of screening using the TyG-BMI index. We conducted a retrospective analysis of clinical data from 602 T2DM patients at an enterprise health lodge from September 2021 to November 2022. Patients were categorized into two groups: T2DM alone (n=250) and T2DM with NAFLD (n=352). The Mann-Whitney U test was used for comparing non-normally distributed continuous data between groups, while the Chi-square test was used for categorical data. Logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the effect of BMI, TyG index, and TyG-BMI index on NAFLD. The ROC curve was used to assess the predictive efficacy of the TyG-BMI index for NAFLD in T2DM patients. BMI predicted the development of NAFLD in T2DM patients with an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of 0.792 (95% CI 0.757-0.828), and the optimal cutoff value was 25.22, with 72.2% sensitivity and 71.6% specificity; The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of the TyG index to predict the development of NAFLD in patients with T2DM was 0.755 (95% CI 0.716-0.794), and the optimal cutoff value was 8. 945, with a sensitivity of 80.1% and a specificity of 59.2%; The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of TyG-BMI index to predict the development of NAFLD in T2DM patients was 0.852, (95% CI 0.822-0.882), and the optimal cutoff value was 227.385, with a sensitivity and specificity of 80.1% and 59.2%, respectively. The TyG-BMI index is a significant predictor of comorbid NAFLD in T2DM patients and provides better screening performance than BMI alone.

A Double-Blinded Randomized Controlled Trial.","Liposomal bupivacaine (LB) is a long-lasting local anesthetic providing analgesia for several days. The current literature examining the efficacy of LB in pain management following third molar extractions remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to compare postoperative pain management between LB and standard bupivacaine (SB) in mandibular third molar extractions. A double-blinded randomized controlled trial of subjects undergoing bilateral mandibular third molar extractions at our institution from 2022 to 2024 was conducted using a split-mouth study design. Subjects were excluded if they received additional mandibular teeth extractions, were unable to complete the questionnaire, or had medical contraindications. The predictor variable was postsurgical local anesthetic agent, and the sides of mouth were randomly assigned to LB or SB. Primary outcome was postoperative pain on a 10-point numerical rating scale (NRS), and the mean cumulative pain rating via area under the curve (AUC) analysis. Secondary outcomes were adverse events and ibuprofen or acetaminophen consumption. Demographics, procedure time, preoperative and perioperative local anesthetics used, and procedural difficulty coded as nonsurgical or surgical were collected. We used mixed-effects models to compare the NRS scores during each time period and paired t-tests to compare AUC values. Statistical tests included 95% CIs with alpha = 0.05. The study sample included 72 subjects (mean age 25.8, SD: 9). Pain was lower in the LB versus SB group on surgery day (NRS difference -0.75; P = .002) until the morning of postoperative day 2 (-0.68, P = .003). When limiting the analysis to bilateral surgical extractions, it was statistically significant until the morning of postoperative day 3 (-0.61, P = .02). AUC analysis showed cumulative pain reduction for the LB group in comparison to the SB group through all 4 postoperative days for the overall cohort (average AUC0-96 difference 93.5, P = .005), with a similar effect for bilateral surgical extractions (101.88, P = .006). LB modestly reduces pain following third molar extractions, with this difference more pronounced following surgical extractions. This suggests that LB may be more beneficial in complex extractions and greater pain-inducing surgeries.","2025","Journal of oral and maxillofacial surgery : official journal of the American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons"

This population-based study extracted datasets from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2017-2020. CMI, VAI, and LAP were included in the multivariate logistic model as both continuous and categorical variables to assess the relationship between different lipid-related parameters and NAFLD. To further elucidate this connection, we utilized restricted cubic splines and conducted subgroup analysis. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve was employed to evaluate the predictive effectiveness of CMI, VAI, and LAP for NAFLD. The study included 2,878 adults as the study population, of whom 1,263 participants were diagnosed with NAFLD. When lipid-related parameters were analyzed as continuous variables, they showed a positive correlation with NAFLD. The OR(95%CI) were 2.29(1.81,2.89) for CMI (per 1-unit), 1.40(1.28,1.52) for VAI (per 1-unit) and 1.15(1.11,1.20) for LAP (per 10-units). This correlation remains statistically significant when the lipid-related parameters are analyzed as categorical variables. In descending order of diagnostic capability for NAFLD, the AUC values are as follows: LAP (0.794), CMI (0.752), and VAI (0.719). CMI, VAI, and LAP may be important clinical indicators for identifying NAFLD, with LAP demonstrating the best predictive ability among them.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

Adrenal vein sampling (AVS) is the gold standard for subtype differentiation but can be unsuccessful by challenging right adrenal vein anatomy. This study aimed to develop a clinical decision model using only measurements from the left adrenal vein (LAV) and peripheral blood (IVC) to differentiate between PA subtypes. The retrospective cohort study included 54 PA patients who underwent bilaterally successful AVS. The main objective was to determine optimal cut-off values for the LAV/IVC index, using ROC analysis for subtype prediction. The predictive value of this index was assessed with the Area Under the Curve (AUC). The Youden index calculated cut-off values, targeting a specificity >90% for PA subtype differentiation. The cohort, averaging 48.5 ± 9.5 years in age, comprised 21 women and 33 men, among whom 26 presented with unilateral and 28 with bilateral disease. LAV/IVC values <1.2 indicated unilateral right-sided disease (specificity 91%, sensitivity 96%, AUC 0.98, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.95-1.0), values 1.2-2.4 suggested bilateral disease (sensitivity 93%, specificity 64%, AUC 0.85, CI 0.73-0.96), whereas values ≥4.4 predicted unilateral left-sided disease (specificity 93%, sensitivity 60%, AUC 0.85, CI 0.73-0.96). Published literature aligns with our results on cut-off values. Utilizing the LAV/IVC index, over 70% of unsuccessful AVS procedures due to failed right adrenal cannulation could be interpreted with over 90% certainty regarding the PA subtype, preventing unnecessary resampling and aiding in determining the preferred treatment.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

Extracellular vesicles (EVs) exist in blood and it contains small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that may reflect disease severity. In this study, we investigated small ncRNAs in serum EVs to identify specific biomarkers for predicting clinical pregnancy. Serum samples were collected from 48 patients who underwent assisted reproductive technology (ART). EVs were successfully isolated from serum samples and characterized using nanoparticle tracking assays, electron microscopy, and western blotting of EV's markers. We performed small RNA sequencing and analyzed microRNA (miRNA) profiles in the infertility patients with and without endometriosis to detect pregnancy-predicting biomarkers. Candidate miRNAs in serum EVs were selected by comparing patients without endometriosis who became pregnant (n = 13) with those who did not (n = 21). A total of 241 miRNAs were detected; however, no trends separated the two groups. Next, EVs from patients with endometriosis were analyzed and divided into pregnant (n = 4) and non-pregnant (n = 10) cases. Among the 224 candidate miRNAs, miRNA profiles of pregnant women with endometriosis were separated from those of non-pregnant women by receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis (area under the curve [AUC] > 0.8). In patients with endometriosis, serum EVs may be useful for predicting possible pregnancy before infertility treatment. Finally, we used small RNA sequencing of the tissue to demonstrate that pregnancy-predicting miRNAs in serum EVs were produced from endometriosis lesions. Although no predictors were found from miRNAs in serum EVs without endometriosis, miRNAs in serum EVs of patients with endometriosis could provide novel noninvasive biomarkers to predict pregnancy and have potential clinical applicability in ART.

Data sources included continuous vital signs and activity, electronic health record (EHR) data - episodic physiological monitoring of laboratory and vital signs, demographics, hospital utilization history, and quality of life survey measures. Five (5) machine learning classifiers were systematically trained by varying input data sources for readmission. Performances of ML models as well as the standard-of-care HOSPITAL score for readmissions were assessed with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and area under precision-recall curve (AUPRC) statistics. There were 29 patients readmitted out of the 354 total included patients (an 8.2 % readmission rate). The average five-fold cross-validation AUROC and AUPRC scores of the five readmission models ranged from 0.76 to 0.84 (P > .05) and 0.23-0.49 (P < .05), respectively.

Brain MLS can be used to determine whether patients require emergency surgery and to predict patients' prognosis. Since brain MLS is usually emergent, it must be diagnosed immediately. Therefore, this study presents a computer-aided deep-learning method for detecting MLS, aiming to predict mortality in a prognosis-predicting cohort using brain MLS and clinical in-formation. The brain midline is a 3-dimensional structure, but computed tomography (CT) slices are 2-dimensional which limits brain MLS detection. Here we propose a keypoint detection method to detect brain midline on each CT slice, acquiring brain MLS distance and area in each slice. Combined with clinical information, patient mortality can be predicted using the multilayer perceptron (MLP) model. The accuracy, precision, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-score for slice selection with the proposed model are 0.966, 0.952, 0.991, 0.932, and 0.971, respectively. Both MLS distance and volume were precisely predicted at slice-level and case-level with only the slightest error. The detected midlines were clearly separated into left and right brain with a dice coefficient of 0.98. The accuracy and AUC of the MLP model were both above 0.8. The model detected large brain MLS cases well in the prediction of outcomes in the prognosis-predicting cohort. The method performs well on slice selection and brain MLS detection, and predictions of MLS distance and volume combined with clinical information predicts the patient's prognosis well.","2025","Heliyon"

We filtered the key genes associated with AA metabolism based on the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and SVM algorithm. Then, we constructed logistic regression models and evaluated the accuracy and specificity by nomogram analysis and DCA. Also, we mapped the ROC curves.Meanwhile, in order to determine the underlying mechanism and relevant biological features of CKD, we conducted differential analysis between high and low risk subgroups in CKD. Moreover,we employed ssGSEA algorithm to evaluate the infiltration abundance of immune cells and calculated the correlation among the immune cells with the key genes. Finally,we validated the expression and clinical relevance of amino acid metabolism key genes via cultured cells and clinical data. A total of six key genes related to amino acid metabolism were identified, including ALDH18A1, CENPF, CSAD, CTH, CYP27B1, HBB. All six genes exhibited promising diagnostic capabilities (AUC:0.7 to 0.9).

While beta-amyloid (Aβ) and tau biomarkers are currently used to discriminate AD from other tauopathies and dementias, additional indicators could enhance patient stratification for specific dementia types. The present study was designed to find potential associations among the classic neurologic markers, Aβ, total and phospho-tau (T-tau and P-tau), with other biomarkers including melatonin and its oxidative-derived metabolite, Formyl-N-acetyl-5-methoxykynurenamine (AFMK) levels, assayed in patients' cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) taken previously for diagnostic purposes. Other factors previously associated with the aetiology of AD, including redox indicators or proinflammatory biomarkers, were also included. The cross-sectional study included a cohort of 148 patients showing signs of dementia. A group of age-matched patients without neurological disorders were used as controls. CSF levels of Aβ, T-tau and P-tau were assayed, and patients were further classified according to threshold CSF levels of the three markers protein following the criteria of NIA-AA. Correlational and group analysis showed a positive association between oxidative stress and neuronal damage. TNF-α negatively correlated with CSF Aβ levels (amyloid plaques) while only RANTES/CCL5 correlated positively with T-tau and P-tau. Qualitative analysis of the proinflammatory cytokines assayed showed a higher detection level in Aβ-positive patients. Regarding melatonin in the CSF, indolamine levels did not correlate with its major oxidative-derived metabolite, i.e., AFMK. However, melatonin CSF levels were significantly reduced in AD patients but not in OT. On the contrary, AFMK showed the opposite pattern, with higher levels in samples from patients displaying high T-tau and P-tau levels. Neuroinflammation was associated with Aβ deposits (low concentration in CSF), while oxidative stress significantly correlated with high T-tau and P-tau levels. Finally, among all the parameters assayed in CSF samples from the cohort studied, P-tau, in combination with antioxidant capacity, offered the best ROC curve for the diagnostic capacity to discriminate between AD and OT, showing an 85 % specificity. While oxidative stress is instead associated with high T- and P-tau levels, higher neuroinflammatory cytokines correlate with low CSF Aβ levels. An intriguing lack of correlation between neuroinflammation and melatonin found in this study could be as a result of sample size and requires further studies with a larger sample size. Even though indolamine levels in CSF drop significantly in AD, they do not correlate with AFMK, suggesting a different kynurenine synthesis source. None of them appear to discriminate between AD and OT. Finally, among all the parameters assayed in this study, P-tau in combination with antioxidant capacity, offered the best ROC curve for the diagnostic ability capacity to discriminate between AD and OT, showing an 85 % specificity. This study holds the potential to significantly improve patient stratification and contribute to the early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer's disease.","2025","Heliyon"

We conducted a prospective study at a Taiwanese medical center from 2019 to 2021. The study compared imaging techniques for breast cancer screening in women with a personal history of precancer or cancer, or a family history (first-degree relatives). The study included breast ultrasound (US) and the CEM combo, which consists of digital mammography (DM), digital breast tomosynthesis (DBT), and CEM. Diagnostic accuracy was compared using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The study included 308 women, average age 52.1, with 86 % having familial breast cancer history and 14 % personal breast cancer or pre-cancerous histories. Approximately 19.5 % had lesions rated BI-RADS 4 or 5. Biopsies were performed on 56 women based on lesions detected by the CEM combo. Additionally, 60 biopsies were due to abnormalities found via DM or DBT (n = 20) or US (n = 40). Breast cancer was confirmed in 8 women post-biopsy. The CEM combo showed a sensitivity of 87.5 %, significantly higher than DM (50 %), DBT (50 %), and US (25 %). The ROC curve area for CEM was 0.85, outperforming DM (0.65), DBT (0.63), and US (0.55), with all comparisons statistically significant (p < 0.05). Lesions detected solely by DM, DBT, or US did not yield any cancer cases. CEM effectively detects breast cancer in higher-risk Taiwanese women, but further research is needed to refine biopsy recommendations.","2025","Heliyon"

Alteration in molecular characteristic expression is closely related to tumor invasiveness and can serve a novel biomarker for predicting cancer prognosis. In this study, we aimed to construct radiomic models through machine learning to predict the progression of CRC. We collected the clinical, pathological, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data of 136 CRC patients who underwent direct surgical resection. Immunohistochemistry analysis was performed to detect the expression levels of p53, synaptophysin (Syn), human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), perineural invasion (PNI), and vascular invasion (VI) expression levels in CRC tissues. After the manual lesion segmentation, 1781 radiomics features were extracted from the transverse T2-weighted image of MRI (T2W-MRI). We employed Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, greedy recursive deletion strategy, minimum redundancy, maximum relevance, least absolute shrinkage, and selection operator regression were utilized to screen for radiological features. Radiomics and clinical models were constructed using the K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The diagnostic efficiencies of the prediction models were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves and quantified employing the area under the curve (AUC). Our research results indicate that compared with the single radioactive model, the clinical radiomics model in the validation cohort showed better diagnostic performance, as indicated by the AUC values (p53 = 0.758, Syn = 0.739, HER2 = 0.786, PNI = 0.835, VI = 0.797). Furthermore, the calibration curve and decision curve analyses showed the clinical benefits. In summary, we developed and validated a clinical radiomics model to preoperative prediction of the biological characteristic expression levels of CRC. The findings of this research may offer a promising noninvasive method for evaluating CRC risk stratification and may lay the groundwork for treatment of this disease.","2025","Heliyon"

We conducted a retrospective longitudinal study spanning 108 consecutive months from 2014 to 2022 in Can Tho, Vietnam to identify common infectious diseases (excluding tuberculosis, HIV, and COVID-19) and their associations with climate change and determine which common diseases presented concurrently with the COVID-19 period using multivariate linear regression, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, Bayesian kernel machine regression (BKMR) and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis. The five infectious diseases with the highest average incidence rates per 100,000 people were diarrhea; hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD); dengue fever; viral hepatitis; and influenza. Positive associations with humidity were observed for dengue fever and HFMD. Temperature was positively associated with malaria. Negative associations were found between humidity and both chickenpox and tetanus. Diarrhea (AUC = 0.79; 95 % CL = 0.70-0.87) and dengue fever (AUC = 0.74; 95 % CL = 0.62-0.83) emerged as the most influential diseases both before and during the COVID-19 period. In our BKMR analysis, we found a significant association between the combined influence of temperature and humidity and the occurrence of dengue fever and HFMD, especially when all climate factors were at or above their 60th percentile relative to their values at the 50th percentile. Temperature emerged as the primary driver associated with the occurrence of infectious diseases. These findings underscore the importance of implementing robust surveillance, prevention, and control measures by public health authorities in Can Tho. Initiatives like vaccination campaigns, vector control programs, public education on hygiene practices, and strengthening healthcare infrastructure are crucial for mitigating the spread of infectious diseases and safeguarding public health in the region.","2025","Heliyon"

Reliable support systems are useful for analyzing ECG signals, for instance, in long-term data acquisition and evaluation (e.g., 24-hour holter recording) or to support physicians in reading ECGs. Analysis of time varying signals may be done by using autoencoders (AEs) deep neural networks. AE specialized for signal data, named Convolutional Autoencoder (CAE), showed the best performances in the analysis of ECG signals. This paper presents a CAE-based framework for ECG signal analysis and anomaly identification. The trained phase is performed on synthetic data signals. The trained neural network obtained is used for the detection of anomalies in ECG signals. The trained framework has been tested on 12 lead ECG signals on a benchmark dataset and applied in scenarios where anomalies are related to cardiological risks and pathologies. The results show interesting results in automatic anomaly detection to support physicians in the decision process. The results show that the CAE-based framework is able to identify anomalies in ECG signals with a ROC AUC of 97.82% on simulated test set and a ROC AUC of 99.75% using a real test set. Finally, the proposed method has been enriched by means of reconstruction error based explainability modules and time-windows based preprocessing modules. Explainability results have been validated using abnormalities annotated by a cardiologist as ground truth and compared with explainations results.

We aimed to assess and compare the diagnostic accuracy of various NITs for NAFLD using network meta-analysis (NMA). We conducted a systematic search in seven databases up to April 2024 to identify studies evaluating the diagnostic values of NITs, with liver biopsy as the gold standard. The participants included patients with suspected or confirmed NAFLD, irrespective of age, sex, ethnicity. Statistical analysis was conducted using R 4.0.3 for Bayesian NMA and STATA 17.0 for pairwise meta-analysis. Sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and superiority index were calculated. Bayesian calculations were performed using the Rstan package, specifying parameters like MCMC chain count, iteration count, and operational cycles. The methodological quality of included studies was assessed using the QUADAS-2 tool. Out of 15,877 studies, 180 were included in the quantitative synthesis, and 102 were used in head-to-head meta-analyses. For diagnosing steatosis stage 1, Hydrogen Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (H-MRS, DOR 15,745,657.6, 95% CI 17.2-1,014,063.59) proved to be the most accurate. For significant fibrosis, HRI leading (DOR 80.94, 95% CI 6.46-391.41), For advanced fibrosis, CK-18 showed the highest performance (DOR 102654.16, 95% CI 1.6-134,059.8). For high-risk NASH, Real-Time Elastography showing the highest performance (DOR 18.1, 95% CI 0.7-96.33). Meta-regression analyses suggested that variability in the diagnostic accuracy of NITs for NAFLD may result from differences in study design, thresholds, populations, and performance indicators. We conducted a network meta-analysis to rank the accuracy of these tests. While some results are promising, not all NITs demonstrate substantial accuracy, highlighting the need for validation with larger datasets. Future research should concentrate on studying the thresholds of NITs and enhancing the clarity of methodological reporting.","2025","Clinical epidemiology"

This study introduces a novel multi-branch and wire-free method for IMR calculation based on coronary angiography. The diagnostic performance of CAG-IMR is validated within a retrospective single-center investigation. In a retrospective single-center study, 139 patients with 201 vessels were evaluated using CAG-IMR for coronary microvascular dysfunction (CMD) detection, utilizing wire-based IMR as the reference standard. CMD was determined based on wire-based IMR ≥25U. CAG-IMR was independently calculated from diagnostic coronary angiography in a blinded fashion, employing the same diagnostic threshold of 25U for CMD identification. CAG-IMR demonstrated significant correlation (r = 0.84, p < 0.001) and good diagnostic performance AUC = 0.97 (95% CI: 0.95-0.99) compared to wire-based IMR. It exhibited the overall diagnostic accuracy at 95.0% (95% CI: 92.0%-98.0%), alongside high sensitivity (92.7%) and specificity (95.6%).

However, no studies to date have explored the association between ACR and the prognosis of patients with rectal cancer. This study aimed to determine the value of albumin-carcinoembryonic antigen ratio (ACR) in predicting the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients with rectal cancer. Survival analysis was conducted using the Kaplan-Meier method, and hazard ratios (HR) were calculated using Cox regression analyses. Nomograms were created based on variables with p < 0.05 in the multivariate Cox regression analysis. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated using the C-index and calibration curve, and its prognostic predictive abilities were compared to those of traditional Tumor Node Metastasis (TNM) stage using discriminant indices. A total of 736 patients with rectal cancer were included in the study. ACR was significantly higher in patients with poor survival or cancer recurrence. A low ACR was associated with increased tumor invasiveness, longer hospital stays, and higher hospitalization costs. Patients with a high ACR had significantly better PFS (62.9% vs. 35.2%, p < 0.001) and OS (67.0% vs. 37.2%, p < 0.001) than those with a low ACR. ACR can serve as an effective auxiliary tool for pathological staging, especially in patients with stage III-IV disease. The relationship between ACR and mortality risk was L-shaped. ACR is an independent prognostic factor for PFS [HR = 0.581, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.458-0.738, p < 0.001] and OS (HR = 0.560, 95% CI: 0.435-0.720, p < 0.001) in rectal cancer patients. ACR-based nomograms have good predictive accuracy and outperform traditional TNM stage in predicting prognosis. Albumin-carcinoembryonic antigen ratio is a simple and effective clinical tool for predicting the recurrence and survival of patients with rectal cancer and is a useful supplement to the TNM stage.","2024","Frontiers in nutrition"

Guideline definitions for FCDI severity classification include ileus, megacolon, shock, or hypotension. However, no hypotension definition is provided, making application of the definition challenging. The objective of this study was to assess optimal hypotension definitions for FCDI severity criteria. This was a multicenter cohort study involving 1172 hospitalized patients diagnosed with C difficile infection (CDI) from 2015 to 2022 (Houston cohort). Patients were assessed for a composite endpoint of colectomy or mortality within 30 days of diagnosis. The ability of the CDI severity criteria to predict the composite endpoint was assessed using 2 definitions of hypotension (systolic blood pressure [SBP] ≤90 mm Hg and mean arterial pressure [MAP] ≤65 mm Hg) through multivariable regression models. A separate CDI cohort of 494 hospitalized patients validated the results (Midwest cohort). The composite endpoint was similar in the Houston cohort (98 patients [8.4%]) and the Midwest cohort (26 patients [5.3%]). Using either a MAP ≤65 mm Hg or SPB ≤90 mm Hg as criteria for hypotension was the best-performing model in both the development and validation cohorts. Removal of hypotension was the worst-performing model in both cohorts. Inclusion of hypotension, defined as SBP ≤90 mm Hg or MAP ≤65 mm Hg, was an important component of FCDI severity criteria, significantly improving the predictive ability to identify FCDI patients at risk for poor outcomes.","2025","Open forum infectious diseases"

Utilizing GIS and MaxEnt model, we predicted the spatial distribution of Terminalia chebula Retz. in China for the current and for the future (2050s and 2070s) under the RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 representative concentration pathways. In this study, we utilized 73 occurrence records and incorporated eight environmental factors from WorldClim for the modeling process. The findings revealed that the evaluation of the model's performance was based on the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). All AUC values exceeded 0.9, classifying these models as ""Excellent."" Additionally, the jackknife test analysis revealed that the main influential variables were bio11 and bio4. Under the present climate conditions, the estimated total suitable habitat for T. chebula is approximately 29.14 × 104 km2, representing around 2.78% of China's total land area. Within these suitable regions, high suitability, medium suitability, and low suitability areas make up 0.39%, 0.54%, and 1.85% of the total area, respectively. According to future climate, the potential growth range of T. chebula is expected to expand due to climate variability, showing a significant pattern of expansion towards the north and east within China. In the 2050s and 2070s, the total area of regions with high suitability, medium suitability, and low suitability under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 will increase compared to the current distribution.

Proteomics using saliva is a key strategy for identifying potential disease biomarkers. We analyzed the untargeted proteomic profiles of saliva samples from 20 individuals with end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) (n = 10) and healthy individuals (n = 10) using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) to identify potential biomarkers for CKD. A volcano plot was generated using a p-value of ≤0.05 and a fold change (FC) ≥ 2.0. Multivariate analysis was performed to generate the orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) model and the variable importance in projection (VIP) scores. The accuracy of candidate biomarker proteins was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. In total, 431 proteins were identified in the salivary proteomic profile, and 3 proteins were significantly different between the groups: apoptosis inhibitor 5 (API5), phosphoinositide phospholipase C (PI-PLC), and small G protein signaling modulator 2 (Sgsm2). These proteins showed good accuracy based on the ROC curve and a VIP score of >2.0. During pathway enrichment, PI-PLC participates in the synthesis of IP3 and IP4 in the cytosol. Gene ontology (GO) analysis revealed data on molecular functions, biological processes, cellular components, and protein classes. We can conclude that the salivary API5, PI-PLC, and Sgsm2 can be potential biomarker candidates for CKD detection.

This study aimed to develop a predictive model for delayed preoperative waiting times in intertrochanteric fracture cases, based on previous research, to offer a valuable reference for clinical decision-making. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 1,116 patients with intertrochanteric fractures admitted to the Affiliated Hospital of Shandong University of Traditional Chinese Medicine for internal fixation surgery from January 2017 to January 2024. Patient demographic data and clinical examination results were collected. A logistic regression model was used to construct a predictive model, which was then visualized through a nomogram. The model's performance was subsequently validated. The predictive model developed from 728 patients in the training cohort, identified key predictors, including age, sex, lower extremity deep vein thrombosis, injury location, and biochemical markers. The model demonstrated strong discriminative ability, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.749 (95% confidence interval: 0.621-0.801) for the training set, and 0.745 in the validation set. Calibration curves indicated that the predicted risk of surgical delay closely aligned with observed outcomes. Furthermore, decision curve analysis verified the model's clinical utility, demonstrating its effectiveness in guiding treatment decisions.

This study aimed to develop a Mangled Digit Severity Score (MDSS) to predict whether a mangled digit should be salvaged. An anonymous questionnaire was sent to 67 hand surgeons at seven hand trauma centers as an initial survey panel. Participants were provided a list of factors influencing outcomes following a mangled digit injury and were asked to assign weights from 0-10 for each factor reflecting its relative importance in determining likelihood of functional salvage versus failure or secondary amputation. Using a modified Delphi method, iterative questionnaire rounds then were performed with seven expert panelists and consensus established. The final ratings were used to develop a weighted scoring system to assess mangled digits. A retrospective single-center review was conducted to validate the scoring system. The sensitivity and specificity for amputation at different MDSS prognostic thresholds were evaluated, and a receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve were calculated. From initial surgeon responses (36/67 response rate) and two subsequent rating rounds, consensus was achieved on 14 factors, including crush/avulsion mechanism, intraarticular fracture, and zone II flexor tendon injury. Final weights for all factors ranged between 3-9. Among 54 mangled digits reviewed, digits that were salvaged had a significantly lower MDSS than those that underwent amputation. The MDSS demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.87. At a threshold of 35, the MDSS achieved a sensitivity of 60% and specificity of 88% in predicting amputation. The MDSS was developed through a consensus of experts and is a useful tool for identifying mangled digits that may not be salvageable. The MDSS provides a structured framework for the assessment of severely injured digits with a prognostic guideline for amputation or salvage.","2025","The Journal of hand surgery"

This study clarified the value of plasma metagenomic next-generation sequencing (p-mNGS) and blood cell mNGS (bc-mNGS) in sepsis diagnosis and evaluation. One hundred and fourty-seven blood samples were collected from sepsis patients who met sepsis 3.0 criteria. Blood culture (BC), qPCR, p-mNGS, bc-mNGS and necessary routine assays were conducted. Taking BC and qPCR as reference, diagnosis performance of p-mNGS and bc-mNGS was analyzed. Blood transcriptome was conducted to evaluate the immunological response of patients in groups with different p/bc-mNGS results. Impact of antibiotic use on different methods was also analyzed. The p-mNGS demonstrated a sensitivity of 100% for bacteria/fungi and 97% for viruses, which was higher than bc-mNGS (88% for bacteria and fungi, 71% for viruses). However, bc-mNGS showed higher concordance with BC results, which indicated that co-mNGS (p-mNGS plus bc-mNGS) protocol increased sensitivity and was helpful to justify viable blood pathogens in sepsis patients. This study showed that p-mNGS(+) & bc-mNGS(+) samples represented more activated immunity response (low expression of interferon-induced genes and high expression of JAK-STAT pathway genes), poorer clinical laboratory indicators (higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment, higher procalcitonin and higher C-reactive protein) and lower survival rate. This study also proved that the use of broad-spectrum antibiotics affected much less on p/bc-mNGS diagnostic ability than on BC.

We employed several machine learning methods to develop and validate a signature based on immune-related genes (IRGs) for subtyping MSS GC patients. Moreover, two deep learning models based on the Vision Transformer (ViT) architecture were developed to predict GC tumor tiles and identify MSS GC subtypes from digital pathology slides. Microsatellite status was evaluated by immunohistochemistry, and prognostic data as well as H&E whole slide images were collected from 105 MSS GC patients to serve as an independent validation cohort. A signature comprising five IRGs was established and validated, stratifying MSS GC patients into high-risk (MSS-HR) and low-risk (MSS-LR) groups. This signature demonstrated consistent performance, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of 0.65, 0.70, and 0.70 at 1, 3, and 5 years in the TCGA cohort, and 0.70, 0.60, and 0.62 in the GEO cohort, respectively. The MSS-HR subtype exhibited higher levels of tumor immune dysfunction and exclusion, suggesting a greater potential for immune escape compared to the MSS-LR subtype. Moreover, the MSS-HR/LR subtypes showed differential sensitivities to various therapeutic drugs. Leveraging morphological differences, the tumor recognition segmentation model (TRSM) achieved an impressive AUC of 0.97, while the MSS-HR/LR identification model (MSSIM) effectively classified MSS-HR/LR subtypes with an AUC of 0.94. Both models demonstrated promising results in classifying MSS GC patients in the external validation cohort, highlighting the strong ability to accurately differentiate between MSS GC subtypes. The IRGs-related MSS-HR/LR subtypes had potential in enhancing outcome prediction accuracy and guide treatment strategies.

Currently, the identification and classification of NASH require invasive liver biopsy, which has certain limitations. Mass spectrometry-based proteomics can detect crucial proteins and pathways implicated in NASH development and progression. We collected liver and serum samples from choline-deficient, L-amino acid-defined high-fat diet fed NASH C57BL/6J mice and human serum samples to examine proteomic alterations and identify early biomarkers for NASH diagnosis. In-depth targeted multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) scanning and immunoblotting assays were used to verify the biomarker candidates from mouse liver and serum samples, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was employed to analyze human serum samples. The MRM analysis of NASH liver revealed 50 proteins with altered expression (18 up- and 32 downregulated) that are involved in biological processes such as detoxification, fibrosis, inflammation, and fatty acid metabolism. Ingenuity pathway analysis identified impaired protein synthesis, cellular stress and defense, cellular processes and communication, and metabolism in NASH mouse liver. Immunoblotting analysis confirmed that the expression of proteins associated with fatty acid metabolism (Aldo B and Fasn) and urea cycle (Arg1, Cps1, and Otc) was altered in mouse liver and serum. Further analysis on human serum samples using ELISA confirmed the increased expression of multiple proteins, including Aldo B, Asl, and Lgals3, demonstrating values of 0.917, 0.979, and 0.965 of area under the curve in NASH diagnosis.

Serum area under the curve was similar across berry-derived treatments, while differences in maximum concentration (Cmax) and time at maximum concentration (Tmax) were observed; for example, urinary recovery of 3-methoxycinnamic acid-4-O-glucuronide was similar following Elliott blueberry and protein bar (p=1.00), while Cmax was 1.24 h later after Elliott blueberry vs protein bar (Tmax=3.84 vs 2.60 h). Alternatively, Cmax for 3-(3-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid was higher following Elliott blueberry vs Olympia blueberry and protein bar (26.63 and 25.32 ng/mL, respectively). Differing berry (poly)phenol content and bioaccessibility only minimally affected bioavailability following consumption of blueberries relative to a blueberry-rich protein bar, suggesting (poly)phenol-dense foods, such as bars and snacks, could provide similar health benefits as raw fruits. Further studies using other crops are required to assess if these findings are translatable.

This study included patients with spinal metastases referred to a single tertiary referral center between 2016 and 2021. Twelve models for predicting 3, 6, and 12-month survival were externally validated Bollen, Mizumoto, Modified Bauer, New England Spinal Metastasis Score, Original Bauer, Oswestry Spinal Risk Index (OSRI), PathFx, Revised Katagiri, Revised Tokuhashi, Skeletal Oncology Research Group Machine Learning Algorithm (SORG-MLA), Tomita, and Van der Linden. Discrimination was assessed using (AUC) and calibration using the intercept and slope. Calibration was considered appropriate if calibration measures were close to their ideal values with narrow confidence intervals. In total, 953 patients were included. Survival was 76.4% at 3 months (728/953), 62.2% at 6 months (593/953), and 50.3% at 12 months (479/953). Revised Katagiri yielded AUCs of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.76-0.82) to 0.81 (95% CI, 0.79-0.84), Bollen yielded AUCs of 0.76 (95% CI, 0.73-0.80) to 0.77 (95% CI, 0.75-0.80), and OSRI yielded AUCs of 0.75 (95% CI, 0.72-0.78) to 0.77 (95% CI, 0.74-0.79).

However, few studies focus on the relationship between small AIS curves without brace treatment and menarche, presenting a challenge to building further evidence. This study aims to investigate the chronological changes in curve progression and risk of final brace initiation around menarche in small AIS curves under 25°. This was a retrospective cohort study. We longitudinally examined 1,090 AIS patients with a curve of less than 25° at the initial visit. Patients were followed up until they achieved skeletal maturity or initiated brace treatment. Curve progression based on time from menarche was analyzed using a t-test. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed based on the time from menarche, with curve magnitude as the independent variable and the final initiation of brace treatment as the dependent variable. Overall, 1,090 female patients were included, with a mean initial visit age of 12.9 years (standard deviation [SD]: 1.5) and a mean coronal Cobb angle of 17.5° (SD: 4.3). Curve progression was significantly decreased between 0-1 and 1-2 years post-menarche (0-1 year post-menarche: 2.9°/year vs. 1-2 years post-menarche: 1.3°/year; p=.03). After 2 years from menarche, the mean curve progression was less than 0.4°/year. The cut-off value of the curve magnitude for the final initiation of brace treatment at the timing of menarche was 20.5° (area under the curve: 0.89, p<.001, 95% confidence interval: 0.86-0.91). This study highlights that in small AIS curves under 25°, minimal curve progression was observed after 2 years post-menarche, aiding follow-up strategies for AIS conservative treatment.","2025","The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society"

This study aimed to develop and validate a risk prediction model for PSL within 2 years in patients undergoing lumbar instrumented fusion surgery based on their risk profiles. Retrospective, observational study. Patients who underwent lumbar instrumented fusion surgery at a single academic institution between May 2015 and February 2019. Risk assessment of PSL and development of a rating score based on patient characteristics. The demographic profiles and radiographic parameters using computed tomography were obtained. These factors were analyzed to determine possible risk factors related to postoperative PSL after 2 years. A scoring system was developed using these independent risk factors and validated using prospectively collected data from another center between May 2019 and December 2021. The occurrence of PSL within 2 years postoperation was 12.7% (40/315). PSL was significantly predicted by smoking, low Hounsfield units (HU) of the pedicle tract at the index level (P), and a low psoas-lumbar vertebral index (PLVI). The risk of PSL according to the categories of the risk score was 1.1% for those with a score of 0-1, 15.1% for a score of 2-3, and 61.5% for a score of 4-6. In validation, this model demonstrated both good discrimination and calibration results. The area under the curve was 0.887 (95% CI 0.830-0.938) for the derivation cohort and 0.835 (95% CI 0.738-0.918) for the external validation cohort. This PSL risk score, including smoking, Index P HU, and PLVI, is a novel approach to predict PSL 2 years postsurgery. This approach highlights the role of factors associated with osteoporosis and sarcopenia in the development of PSL and could aid in preoperative decision-making and surgical planning.","2025","The spine journal : official journal of the North American Spine Society"

The challenge of implementing multi-day assessments in resource-constrained settings motivated the development of a machine learning (ML) model using data only from the 1st day of assessment to predict DIBH ineligibility. This prospective cohort study used data from 202 patients collected between January and December 2023 for model development. Patient-related and DIBH assessment-related variables (upper, lower, and average breath-hold amplitude; average breath-hold duration; breath-hold consistency) were included. Nine ML algorithms (and three modelling strategies) were evaluated, and a decision curve analysis was used to select the best model. The best model was temporally validated on a prospective dataset of 47 patients (January to March 2024). Further, a clinical impact study on another prospective cohort of 64 patients (April to August 2024) was performed, to assess its practical utility by comparing its predictions with the clinical team's decision to treat a patient in DIBH or not. The uncalibrated gradient-boosting ensemble model demonstrated the highest performance [AUC (95 % CI) = 0.803 (0.686-0.941); Recall = 0.526] and net benefit in decision curve analysis. Key predictors included average breath-hold duration and lower breath-hold amplitude levels. The clinical impact study suggests that the model reduces the need for additional DIBH assessments by up to 20 % without misclassifying eligible patients. The developed ML model accurately predicts DIBH ineligibility using only first-day DIBH assessment data and could be a decision aid for patient selection in resource-constrained or busy departments. External validation is necessary to confirm its generalizability.","2025","Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology"

A total of 469 PDAC patients from four hospitals were divided into training and test sets. Handcrafted radiomics and deep learning (DL) features were extracted from optimal regions of interest, encompassing both intratumoral and peritumoral areas. Univariate Cox regression, LASSO regression, and multivariate Cox regression selected features for three image signatures (intratumoral, peritumoral radiomics, and DL). A multiscale nomogram was constructed and validated against the 8th AJCC staging system. The 4 mm peritumoral VOI yielded the best radiomics prediction, while a 15 mm expansion was optimal for deep learning. The multiscale nomogram demonstrated a C-index of 0.82 (95 % CI: 0.78-0.85) in the training set and 0.70 (95 % CI: 0.64-0.76) in the external test 1 (high-volume hospital), with the external test 2 (low-volume hospital) showing a C-index of 0.78 (95 % CI: 0.65-0.91). These outperformed the AJCC system's C-index (0.54-0.57). The area under the curve (AUC) for recurrence prediction at 0.5, 1, and 2 years was 0.89, 0.94, and 0.89 in the training set, with AUC values ranging from 0.75 to 0.97 in the external validation sets, consistently surpassing the AJCC system across all sets. Kaplan-Meier analysis confirmed significant differences in prognosis between high- and low-risk groups (P < 0.01 across all cohorts). The multiscale nomogram effectively stratifies recurrence risk in PDAC patients, enhancing presurgical clinical decision-making and potentially improving patient outcomes.","2025","Radiotherapy and oncology : journal of the European Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology"

Although some proteins have been proposed as biomarkers, the diagnosis of SSc remains a challenge for clinicians. The soluble oncostatin M receptor (sOSMR) is a potential biomarker for the diagnosis of SSc, as it appears to act as an antagonist of oncostatin M (OSM)-mediated signaling, which is involved in biological and inflammatory processes, including tissue injury and fibrosis. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of sOSMR in systemic sclerosis. Serum samples were collected from 105 patients with SSc, 50 with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), 64 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and 130 healthy controls (HC). The sOSMR levels were measured using an ELISA kit, and a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to analyze the biomarker's potential for diagnosing SSc. sOSMR levels are significantly elevated in the serum of patients with SSc when compared to patients with RA and SLE, as well as healthy controls (p < 0.0001 for all comparisons). The area under the curve (AUC) of ROC curve analysis revealed the ability of sOSMR serum levels to distinguish patients with SSc from those with RA (0.901 [95 % CI 0.842-0.943]; p < 0.0001), with a sensitivity of 89.52 % and specificity of 78.00 %, and from patients with SLE (0.897 [95 % CI 0.841-0.938]; p < 0.0001), with a sensitivity of 81.90 % and specificity of 89.06 %, as well as from healthy controls (0.876 [95 % CI 0.827 - 0.916]; p < 0.0001), with a sensitivity of 82.86 % and specificity of 81.54 %. When comparing patients with SSc to patients with other diseases (RA and SLE combined), an AUC of 0.898 ([95 % CI 0.851-0.935]; p < 0.0001) was found, with a sensitivity of 82.86 % and specificity of 85.09 %. Serum sOSMR levels are elevated in patients with SSc and have shown a good ability to distinguish between SSc patients, patients with other autoimmune rheumatologic diseases (RA and SLE), and healthy controls. Thus, sOSMR is a promising marker for diagnosing SSc.","2025","Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry"

Rapid and reliable detection methods are crucial for timely treatment and effective infection control, especially in resource-limited settings. In this study, we developed a CRISPR/Cas12a-based colorimetric biosensor that leverages Cas12a's trans-cleavage activity to release left single-stranded DNA (lDNA). The released lDNA facilitates hybridization with clDNA-functionalized gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), resulting in a visible color change. The biosensor achieved a detection limit of 100 CFU/reaction for P. aeruginosa within 2 hours, with excellent specificity and robustness, as validated in spiked sputum and blood samples. Clinical testing using 32 blood samples (13 positive, 19 negative) confirmed its high diagnostic accuracy, achieving an AUC of 1 in ROC curve analysis.

Adults ≥21 years who received at least two chest CT scans at an academic medical center between 2005 and 2020 and were found to have ILD were studied retrospectively. Lung cancer diagnoses were adjudicated based on pathology reports from lung biopsies. Logistic regression was used to evaluate associations of clinical variables with comorbid lung cancer. Among 1,366 adults with ILD, the mean age was 67.2 ± 12.4 years and 639 (46.8 %) were men. In total, 227 adults (16.6 %) had a lung nodule on CT imaging, of whom 55 (24.3 %) were diagnosed with lung cancer. Radiographic usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP) (OR 3.00, 95 % CI 1.43-6.33) was independently associated with increased odds of lung cancer. Risk factors including age, sex, smoking status, pack-years, use of immunosuppression, and radiographic fibrosis pattern collectively demonstrated high discriminative accuracy in predicting comorbid lung cancer, even among adults who would not have qualified for lung cancer screening based on current guidelines (AUC 0.80, 95 % CI 0.72-0.88). In a large study of adults with ILD, radiographic UIP was independently associated with comorbid lung cancer even after adjusting for established risk factors. Our results suggest radiographic UIP is an independent lung cancer risk factor and support the development of targeted lung cancer screening guidelines in adults with UIP.","2025","Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"

This study included 205, 44, and 35 patients in the training, internal validation, and external validation sets, respectively. The Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ensemble models were evaluated based on the mean squared error, root mean squared error, R-squared value, and accuracy (±20 % of the actual dose). In internal validation, the Random Forest model achieved the highest 20% Accuracy at 56.8%, while the XGBoost model achieved 56.8% and Voting Ensemble models attained 54.5% accuracy. In external validation, the XGBoost model achieved the highest 20% Accuracy at 74.3%, followed by Random Forest and Voting Ensemble, both also achieving 74.3% accuracy. The estimated glomerular filtration rate was the most significant predictor in all models, with body weight, serum creatinine, height, and age also prominently influencing the XGBoost model's predictions.

In this retrospective study, we analyzed CSF samples for biomarkers GFAP, QAlb, neurofilament light, and total-Tau, from patients with AQP4-NMOSD, DNNMOSD, MOGAD, and MS in the Region Västra Götaland, Sweden. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis with calculation of the area under the curve (AUC) was used to identify optimal cut-off levels for discriminating AQP4-NMOSD from the other groups. Logistic regression models assessed the diagnostic power of GFAP and QAlb combined. Patients with AQP4-NMOSD (N = 19) had significantly higher CSF GFAP levels than the others: median 2470 ng/L vs 330 ng/L (p < 0.001). The GFAP cutoff >715 ng/L gave a sensitivity of 81 % and specificity of 92 %. Combining GFAP and QAlb further increased the diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.96).

Clinical data, including US features, were collected. Radiomics features were extracted from grayscale US images, followed by feature selection to establish a radiomics score (Radscore) model. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified independent risk factors for the clinical and radiomics nomogram models. Model performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves, decision curve analysis, net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement. 16 radiomics features were selected for the Radscore model. Tumor margin and calcification emerged as significant preoperative risk factors for HER-2 status, forming the basis of a clinical prediction model. The integrated radiomics nomogram, combining tumor margin, calcification, and Radscore, demonstrated strong discrimination with area under the curve values of 0.810 in the training dataset and 0.807 in the validation dataset.

We searched PubMed for any study reporting ≥1 diagnostic performance metrics. Risk of bias was evaluated with the QUADAS2 tool. We included 7 studies encompassing 152 patients with a biopsy showing FL (or indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma) and 111 with a biopsy confirming HT. Study designs and study populations differed substantially. PET methods were poorly reported and 18F-FDG dose was highly variable. Most studies were judged to be at high risk of bias in the patient and index test domains of QUADAS2. The diagnostic performance of 5 PET parameters were reported in at least one study but only SUVmax (n = 7) was reported in >2. Median SUVmax ranged from 9.2 to 10.9 in FL/iNHL and from 13.7 to 24.4 in HT. While SUVmax was consistently higher in the HT group, there was considerable overlap between the two groups and significant variability between studies. Area under the ROC curve for SUVmax to distinguish between FL/iNHL and HT ranged from 0.68 to 0.97. Sensitivity and specificity of the proposed cutoffs also varied widely (sensitivity ∼0.6 to 1, specificity ∼0.4 to 1). In conclusion, few studies - mostly small and potentially biased - have addressed this question. Although SUVmax is generally higher in HT than in FL, the diagnostic performance and optimal cutoffs remain unclear. Proposed SUVmax cutoffs should not be used to determine whether a patient has HT or to decide whether a biopsy should be obtained. For now, we encourage physicians to evaluate results of their own practice to devise a prudent workup of suspected.","2025","Blood reviews"

It remains unclear to what extent ER repertoires can assess the risk of MDD and other psychiatric disorders. Three subsamples including 1397 non-clinical individuals, 135 MDD patients, and 127 healthy controls (HCs) were combined to explore ER repertoires. We further built classifiers of ER repertoires to distinguish MDD patients from HCs, and additionally examined its performance based on published studies (total N = 4918). Adaptive, average, maladaptive, and intensely maladaptive repertoires were identified. The classifier based on ER repertoires effectively distinguished MDD patients from HCs, demonstrating an AUC of 0.803 (SD = 0.067). Additionally, the classifier exhibited discriminatory power for various psychopathologies in published studies, including depression, anxiety, eating disorders, PTSD, and personality disorders (AUC: 0.616-0.779). Future studies should investigate the longitudinal influence of ER repertoires on the development of psychopathologies. Our findings suggest that an individual's ER repertoire is a critical psychopathological risk that can serve as a valuable indicator for assessing risk and imply the potential utility of reforming ER repertoire.","2025","Journal of affective disorders"

This study employed a multiple-group prospective design with a 3-year follow-up. CHR individuals and HCs were assessed at baseline and at a 2-month follow-up. Neuropsychological performance was evaluated using the Chinese version of the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia Consensus Cognitive Battery. The study included 310 CHR individuals and 93 HCs. Significant improvements in predicting non-remission in CHR individuals were observed when incorporating cognitive changes over 2 months (AUC for baseline cognition, 0.690; AUC for changes, 0.819; Z=3.365, p<0.001). Key predictors included the Revised Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (HVLT-R; β=0.083, p=0.003), Wechsler Memory Scale-III spatial span (WMS-3; β=0.330, p<0.001), and Revised Brief Visuospatial Memory Test (BVMT-R; β=0.127, p<0.001). Conversely, predicting conversion to psychosis showed no significant difference between baseline and 2-month cognitive changes (AUC for baseline cognition, 0.667; AUC for changes, 0.666; Z=0.021, p=0.242). The findings underscore the importance of dynamic cognitive monitoring in CHR individuals. Short-term cognitive changes significantly enhance the prediction of non-remission but do not add predictive value for conversion to psychosis beyond baseline assessments. Specific cognitive domains, such as verbal learning and working memory, are particularly valuable for predicting clinical outcomes.","2025","Biological psychiatry"

We retrospectively analyzed computed tomography scans of 61 patients who had calcaneal fractures to examine peroneal tendon dislocation and the association with degree of lateral wall displacement and presence of fleck signs, between peroneal tendon dislocation and non-dislocation cases. Peroneal tendon dislocation was observed in 11.5 % (7/61) of the scan of patients with acute calcaneal fractures. The mean measurement of lateral wall displacement of the calcaneus was -3.3 (-11.1 to 8.9) mm. The fleck sign on radiographic images was evident in two cases (3.3 %), whereas the fleck sign on scans was evident in three cases (4.9 %). The mean measurement was significantly greater in cases with peroneal tendon dislocation than in those without dislocation (3.0 vs -4.1 mm, P<.05). The incidence of peroneal tendon dislocation and the lateral wall distance were significantly associated with the severity of calcaneal fractures, according to the Sanders classification system. The area under the curve generated for the medial deviation of the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.976 and the cut-off value was 0.9. This study showed that lateral wall displacement is related to peroneal tendon dislocation and that the measurement of displacement using computed tomography scans can be a useful indicator of peroneal tendon dislocation.

Higher median PPGs were observed in patients with than without esophageal varices (11.6mmHg vs 4.1), portal hypertensive gastropathy (10.5mmHg vs 3.3), and thrombocytopenia (7.6 mmHg vs 4.4) (p<0.001). Individuals with PH and clinically significant PH (PPG>10) were 6.7 and 3.8 times more likely to have cirrhosis on histology. EUS-PPG was the best overall predictor of biopsy proven cirrhosis (AUC 0.84) compared to FIB-4 (0.72), and APRI (0.54). There were 2 minor adverse events related to PPG (post procedural pain). EUS-PPG measurement was technically feasible, safe and demonstrated strong correlation with clinical parameters of PH and liver histology. The strongest predictor of cirrhosis was EUS-PPG >5mm Hg which outperformed non-invasive markers of fibrosis.","2025","Clinical gastroenterology and hepatology : the official clinical practice journal of the American Gastroenterological Association"

However, its role in chronic heart failure (CHF) -induced systemic inflammation and postural control is unknown. Here we aim to assess the potential association of soluble osteonectin with cardiac dysfunction and postural imbalance in CHF. The cardiac function, physical performance, including short physical performance battery (SPPB) for balance, handgrip strength (HGS), and the levels of plasma osteonectin and c-reactive protein (CRP) were assessed in controls (n = 56) and CHF patients (n = 286) presented with ischemic and non-ischemic CHF. CHF patients exhibited significantly lower HGS and postural balance accompanied by higher cardiac contractile dysfunction. Regardless of HF etiologies, the osteonectin and CRP levels were significantly higher in CHF patients vs. controls. The osteonectin exhibited a significant inverse correlation with left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in both ischemic (r2 = 0.13, P < 0.0001) and non-ischemic (r2 = 0.18, P < 0.0001) CHF patients. Similarly, osteonectin has shown a strong negative correlation with cumulative SPPB score in both ischemic (r2 = 0.19, P < 0.0001) and non-ischemic (r2 = 0.22, P < 0.0001) patients. Further SPPB balance-based analysis demonstrated lower LVEF and markedly elevated osteonectin and CRP (P < 0.0001), particularly in patients with poor postural balance compared to those with relatively good balance. Importantly, osteonectin demonstrated significantly higher sensitivity and specificity for CHF diagnosis on ROC curve analysis. Taken together, higher osteonectin level is associated with LV dysfunction and postural imbalance irrespective of CHF etiologies. It may serve as a biomarker for physical disability and contractile dysfunction in CHF patients.","2025","Vascular pharmacology"

However, quantification of RVPAc components by 2D echocardiography in patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation (TR) has significant limitations, and the traditional RVPAc parameter neglects the degree of volume overload/dilatation of the RV, which is another key clinical indicator for right ventricular dysfunction (RVD).Therefore, we aimed to assess RVD by a novel RVPAc parameter, including the three important drivers of RVD, for an improved prediction of 1-year mortality after T-TEER. We analyzed 262 patients undergoing T-TEER with complete 3D RV echocardiography and 1-year follow-up. Increased 3D-RV enddiastolic volume (3D-RVEDV: HR 1.85; 1.10-3.12; p=0.020) and impaired RV free wall longitudinal strain (RVFWLS: hazard ratio (HR) 1.73, 1.02-2.92, p=0.042) predicted 1-year mortality. A novel RVPAc parameter [RVFWLS/(3D-RVEDV*sPAPinvasive)] including all 3 important drivers for RVD was developed, associating RVPA-uncoupling with a tripled risk for 1-year mortality (HR 3.19, 1.7-6.0, p<0.001). The novel RVPAc parameter significantly outperformed the traditional non-invasive RVPAc parameter in 1-year mortality prediction (c-index: 0.68 vs. 0.57 for novel vs. traditional non-invasive RVPAc; p=0.027). The novel RVPAc parameter, integrating RV function, volume stress, and pressure stress is a powerful metric for RV failure and a superior predictor for survival post-T-TEER.","2025","The Canadian journal of cardiology"

Inclusion criteria included studies reporting CSO thresholds including minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), or patient acceptable symptomatic state (PASS) for patients following ACL reconstruction with minimum 12-month follow-up. The MINORS criteria was used to assess study quality. Study demographics, patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs), CSO thresholds, and method of CSO calculation were collected. A total of 56 studies (n=52,292 patients) met the final inclusion criteria. Reported PROMs included International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC) (n=35 studies), Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome score (KOOS) (n=33 studies), Tegner (n=20 studies) and Lysholm (n=19 studies) scores. The PASS was reported in 35 studies, MCID in 30, and SCB in 4. Among the studies that reported PASS, the most used threshold calculation was the ROC-Youden index (71.4%, n=25/35). In the studies reporting MCID, the most used threshold calculation was the 0.5 standard deviation (SD) of mean change method (36.7%, n=11/30). The most reported threshold calculation among the SCB studies was the ROC curve analysis (75%, n=3/4). In studies independently calculating CSOs, the most common methods were 0.5 standard deviations (SD) of mean change for MCID (50%, n=10/20), the ROC-Youden index for PASS (73.3%, n=11/15), and ROC curve analysis (75.0%, n=3/4) for SCB. Descriptions of anchor questions were reported in 22 studies (39.3%).

The systematic review included 23 studies with 4,486 HCC patients. The AI algorithm receiver operator characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) for predicting HCC response to TACE based on mRECIST criteria ranged from 0.55 to 0.97. Radiomics-models outperformed non-radiomics models (AUCs: 0.79, 95 %CI: 0.75-0.82 vs. 0.73, 0.61-0.77, respectively). The best ML methods used for the prediction of TACE response for HCC patients were CNN, GB, SVM, and RF with AUCs of 0.88 (0.79-0.97), 0.82 (0.71-0.89), 0.8 (0.60-0.87) and 0.8 (0.55-0.96), respectively. Of all predictive feature models, those combining clinic-radiologic features (ALBI grade, BCLC stage, AFP level, tumor diameter, distribution, and peritumoral arterial enhancement) had higher AUCs compared with models based on clinical characteristics alone (0.79, 0.73-0.89; p = 0.04 for CT + clinical, 0.81, 0.75-0.88; p = 0.017 for MRI + clinical versus 0.6, 0.55-0.75 in clinical characteristics alone).

An accurate risk prediction is significant for prevention of screw loosening through preoperative planning. In this study, we proposed a novel index, namely the bone mineral density surrounding the screw thread (thread BMD), and tested its predictability in screw loosening. 86 screws (18 loosening and 68 non-loosening) from L3-L5 of 20 patients who experienced pedicle screw loosening were analyzed. The preoperative and postoperative quantitative CT scans of the same vertebra were spatially registered and a helix-based approach was developed to extract the thread BMD. BMDs of the vertebral body, the pedicle and the screw trajectory were also measured from the preoperative CT scans. Finite element analysis was conducted to determine pullout strength and tissue failure around the screw. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to assess the performances of all BMD indices and pullout strength in predicting screw loosening. Linear regression was used to examine correlations between different BMD indices and screw pullout strength. The thread BMD had the greatest value of area under the curve (AUC = 0.73, p = 0.004) compared to vertebral BMD (AUC = 0.51, p = 0.923), pedicle BMD (AUC = 0.56, p = 0.474) and trajectory BMD (AUC = 0.67, p = 0.020). Also, the thread BMD showed a stronger correlation with the pullout strength (r = 0.83, p < 0.001) than vertebral BMD (r = 0.59, p < 0.001), pedicle BMD (r = 0.65, p < 0.001) and trajectory BMD (r = 0.60, p < 0.001). We developed a novel approach to measure a newly-defined thread BMD, which indicates superior capacities over other BMD indices in predicting pedicle screw loosening.","2025","Journal of biomechanics"

This case-control study measured over 2000 serum features, including 37 ECs, 6 biochemicals, and 2057 endogenous metabolites, in serum samples collected from 48 EPL patients and healthy pregnant women. The median total concentration of targeted EC in the EPL group (65.9 ng/mL) was significantly higher than in controls (43.0 ng/mL; p < 0.05). Four machine learning algorithms were employed to identify key molecular features and develop EPL risk prediction models. A random forest model based on chemical data achieved a predictive accuracy of 95 %, suggesting a potential association between EPL and chemical exposure, with phthalic acid esters identified as significant contributors. Ninety-five potential metabolite biomarkers were selected, which were predominantly enriched in pathways related to spermidine and spermine biosynthesis, ubiquinone biosynthesis, and pantothenate and coenzyme A biosynthesis. C17-sphinganine was identified as a leading biomarker with an area under the curve of 0.93. Furthermore, exposure to bis(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate was linked to an increased risk of EPL by disrupting lipid metabolism. These findings indicate that combining untargeted metabolomics with machine learning approaches offers novel insights into the mechanisms of EPL related to EC exposure.","2025","Journal of hazardous materials"

Previous studies have been limited by traditional research methods, making it challenging to encompass diverse risk factors and automate screening or prediction of adolescents' alcohol use. This study aimed to develop prediction algorithms for adolescent alcohol use in South Korea using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models, and to identify important features. The study utilized a combination of DL (i.e., Auto-encoder) and ML (i.e., Logistic regression, Ridge, LASSO, Elasticnet, Decision tree, Random forest, AdaBoost, and XGBoost) algorithms to develop the prediction models. It involves 41,239 Korean adolescents and 46 socio-ecological input variables based on cross-sectional data. The analysis revealed that the prediction algorithms had AUC scores ranging from 0.6325 to 0.7214. The feature importance analysis indicates that variables within the domains of sociodemographic characteristics, physical and mental health, behavioral problems, family factors, school factors, and social factors all play significant roles. The developed algorithms enable automatic and early identification of adolescent alcohol use within public health practice settings. By leveraging a comprehensive array of input variables, these methods surpass the limitations of traditional regression approaches, offering novel insights into the critical risk factors associated with alcohol use among Korean adolescents, thereby facilitating early and targeted prevention efforts.","2025","Social science & medicine (1982)"

A systematic literature search was conducted in key electronic databases. studies published in English, longitudinal cohort or case-control design, reporting outcomes on return to sport or Tegner Activity Score (TAS), participants aged ≥16 years undergoing primary ACL reconstruction, and defined as athletes/sport players or having a pre-injury TAS ≥5. Only associations between predictors and outcomes that were analyzed in ≥3 studies and had consistent results in the same direction in ≥75 % of the studies were considered and reported. Risk of bias was evaluated using the QUIPS or PROBAST tools, and certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE framework. 37 studies (5 low, 6 moderate, and 26 high risk of bias) on prognostic factors and 1 study on prognostic models (low risk of bias), representing 6278 participants, were included. Six prognostic factors were identified and rated as very low certainty evidence: fewer concomitant meniscal injuries, shorter time between injury and surgery, higher jump test scores, better physical functioning, higher muscle strength, and greater psychological readiness to return to sport. Two prognostic models with AUC 0.77-0.78 and 70 % accuracy for predicting return to sport were identified. There is a very low certainty of evidence that returning to sport is associated with both physical, psychological and demographic prognostic factors.

Adjuvant chemotherapy is still considered an effective and priority treatment for advanced-stage colorectal patients. We retrospectively collected patients with colorectal liver metastases from January 2012 to October 2023 at the Guangxi Medical University Cancer Hospital. The baseline information was compared between a simultaneous curative resection group and a palliative treatment group. Propensity score matching with a 1:1 ratio was applied to develop comparable cohorts of curative resection and palliative treatment resection. Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of curative resection on survival of colorectal liver metastasis patients. Prognostic nomogram and a web-version calculator were developed based on the multivariate Cox regression method. Then, the concordance index (C-index), receiver operating characteristic, calibration plots, and decision curves analysis were applied to evaluate the prognostic performance of the nomogram. A total of 716 patients with colorectal liver metastases were enrolled in the study, of whom 131 patients received curative resection. There was no significant difference in terms of baseline information between the curative resection group and the palliative treatment group after propensity score matching. Multivariable Cox regression analysis showed that curative resection was an independent prognostic factor affecting overall survival (P = .001, hazard ratio = 1.95, 95% confidence interval 1.30-2.91). Compared with patients who did not receive curative resection, patients who received simultaneous curative resection had a significant improvement in overall survival before and after propensity score matching (P < .0001 and P = .0047, respectively). Overall survival nomogram showed excellent predictive performance with the C-indexes of 0.686 (95% confidence interval 0.556-0.792). The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves were 0.75 (95% confidence interval 64.43-96.05), 0.75 (67.22-82.58), and 0.76 (66.10-85.98) for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, respectively. The calibration plots and decision curves analysis also indicated the good predictability of the predictive nomogram. Finally, subgroup analysis further demonstrated a favorable impact of curative resection on overall survival in colorectal liver metastasis patients after propensity score matching. Simultaneous curative resection may improve the overall survival of patients with colorectal liver metastases and is an independent and effective indicator for predicting overall survival.

The all-cause mortality rate within 3 months after surgery in BGI patients was higher than that in non BGI patients (24.66% vs. 3.23%, P < 0.001). The Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with BGI had a higher postoperative mortality rate at 3 months (P < 0.001). After adjusting for potential covariates, multivariable analysis showed a significant correlation between BGI and 3-month postoperative mortality rate (adjusted HR: 5.694, 95%CI: 2.379-13.626, P<0.001). The area under the ROC curve predicted by BGI, preoperative ASPECT score, and a combination model including BGI and ASPECT score for all-cause mortality within 3 months after surgery were 0.753, 0.762 and 0.853 respectively.

This single-center, retrospective cohort study included 134 patients. The primary outcome was voriconazole-induced hepatotoxicity. The cutoff value of the ALBI score was determined using a receiver operating characteristic curve. The cumulative risk of hepatotoxicity was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier curve analysis with a log-rank test for the cutoff value and ALBI grade. Moreover, the group of patients with the trough concentration of voriconazole 1-4 μg/mL was also investigated. The incidence of hepatotoxicity was 13.4% (18/134). The cutoff value of the ALBI score was -1.91 (sensitivity, 0.611; specificity, 0.655; area under the curve, 0.615). The cumulative risk of hepatotoxicity was significantly higher in the ALBI score ≥-1.91 group than in the ALBI score <-1.91 group (P = 0.024) and patients with higher ALBI grades tended to be at higher risk (P = 0.080). The cumulative risk tended to be higher with ALBI ≥-1.91 in the trough concentration 1-4 μg/mL group; however, no significant difference was found (P = 0.134). The pilot study indicated that the ALBI score ≥-1.91 may be an indicator for voriconazole-induced hepatotoxicity even when TDM is conducted. Because this study was a single-center and small cohort design, further studies should be conducted using a large datasets and translational research.","2025","Clinical therapeutics"

This study utilized quantitative US local attenuation coefficient slope (LACS) imaging to address these limitations. This is a prospective, cross-sectional study in adult patients with definable solid liver nodules at US conducted from March 2021 to December 2023. The composite reference standard included histopathology when available or magnetic resonance imaging. LACS images were obtained using a phantom-free method. Nodule visibility was assessed by computing the contrast-to-noise ratio (CNR). Classification accuracy for differentiating benign and malignant lesions was assessed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), along with sensitivity and specificity. The study enrolled 97 patients (age: 62 y ± 13 [standard deviation]), with 57.0% malignant and 43.0% benign observations (size: 26.3 ± 18.9 mm). LACS images demonstrated higher CNR (12.3 dB) compared to B-mode (p < 0.0001). The AUC for differentiating nodules and liver parenchyma was 0.85 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.79-0.90), with higher values for malignant (0.93, CI: 0.88-0.97) than benign nodules (0.76, CI: 0.66-0.87). A LACS threshold of 0.94 dB/cm/MHz provided a sensitivity of 0.83 (CI: 0.74-0.89) and a specificity of 0.82 (CI: 0.73-0.88). LACS mean values were higher (p < 0.0001) in malignant (1.28 ± 0.27 dB/cm/MHz) than benign nodules (0.98 ± 0.19 dB/cm/MHz). LACS imaging improves nodule visibility and provides better differentiation between benign and malignant liver nodules, showing promise as a diagnostic tool.","2025","Ultrasound in medicine & biology"

Seventy-one women with 71 confirmed lesions. 3.0 T; oscillating gradient spin-echo (OGSE), OGSE with MB, and pulsed gradient spin-echo, and routine magnetic resonance imaging squences. TDS with MB was used to assess diagnostic efficacy in differentiating benign and malignant tumors. A comparison of scanning time and image quality was performed in 17 patients. Imaging parameters were analyzed using limited spectrally edited diffusion (IMPULSED) and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) values were compared between MB and non-MB protocols. The cell diameter from TDS was compared with histopathological measurements in 21 patients. Bland-Altman plot, paired t test, Mann-Whitney U test, kappa test, DeLong's test, intraclass correlation coefficient agreement, receiver operating characteristic curve, area under the curve (AUC), and simple linear regression, with statistical significance set at P < 0.05. The TDS with MB protocol had a shorter average scanning time than that without MB protocol (7 minutes 22 seconds vs. 12 minutes 28 seconds); image quality was improved by reducing image artifacts. Most IMPULSED parameters and ADC values did not significantly differ between the MB and non-MB protocols (P = 0.23, P = 0.17). The IMPULSED parameters of cellularity and intracellular volume fraction achieved the highest AUC values for distinguishing breast tumors (0.865 and 0.821, respectively), surpassing the diagnostic efficiency of conventional ADC-1000 (0.776). The correlation between IMPULSED parameters and microscopic cell size was strong (r = 0.842). The MB technique improved the TDS protocol's efficiency and reduced the image artifacts. TDS parameters correlated with pathological findings and showed good performance in differentiating benign from malignant breast tumors. We explored the impact of simultaneous multislice acquisition technology on temporal diffusion spectroscopy (TDS) and whether combining this method could help distinguish benign from malignant breast tumors. Our findings showed that simultaneous multislice acquisition technology shortened the scanning time and improved image quality by reducing motion-related issues. Additionally, measurements of cell size using simultaneous multislice acquisition technology matched well with results from pathology tests. Overall, our study suggests that simultaneous multislice acquisition enhanced TDS could make breast cancer diagnosis more accurate and efficient, offering good advantages compared to conventional imaging methods. 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.","2025","Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI"

This prospective study included adults hospitalized for ADHF without treatable secondary causes. We employed a 4-zone LUS method to quantify B-lines. The primary endpoint was a composite of mortality or rehospitalization within 180 days. We used univariate and multivariate Cox models to evaluate the prognostic value of B-lines. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve identified the optimal B-lines threshold. We included 155 patients (median age: 81 years [IQR 75-85]; 52.9% male). After the follow-up period, 53 (34.2%) patients met the primary endpoint. The ROC curve for the number of B-lines at discharge showed an AUC of 0.8, with 7 B-lines identified as the optimal cutoff (sensitivity: 70%, specificity: 82%). In univariate analysis, the global B-line count at discharge (HR: 1.33, 95% CI 1.22-1.45) was significantly associated with the primary endpoint. Using a cutoff of ≥7 B-lines, the association was stronger (HR: 6.92, 95% CI 3.80-12.60). After multivariable adjustment, ≥7 B-lines at discharge remained significant (HR: 4.41, 95% CI 1.98-9.81).

Our study aimed to identify a panel of serum mature microRNAs (miRNAs) for PC diagnosis. We conducted a PubMed search to identify candidate mature miRNAs associated with PC. We then used quantitative reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) to assess the expression profiles of these mature miRNAs in serum samples from 112 PC patients and 112 healthy controls (HCs). We selected mature miRNAs with favorable diagnostic potential by analyzing receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calculating the area under the curve (AUC).

However, existing approaches fail to fully utilize regional heterogeneous electronic health record (EHR) data. Integrating this data can provide a more comprehensive understanding of depression and anxiety in T2DM patients, leading to more personalized treatment strategies. This study aims to develop and validate a deep learning model, the Regional EHR for Depression and Anxiety Prediction Model (REDAPM), using regional EHR data to predict depression and anxiety in patients with T2DM. A case-control development and validation study was conducted using regional EHR data from the Nanjing Health Information Center (NHIC). Two retrospective, matched (1:3) datasets were constructed from the full cohort for the model's internal and external validation. These two datasets were selected from the NHIC data of 2020 and 2022, respectively. The REDAPM incorporates both structured and unstructured EHR data, capturing the temporal dependency of clinical events. The performance of REDAPM was compared to a set of baseline models, evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) and the area under the precision-recall curve (PR-AUC). Subgroup, ablation, and interpretation analyses were conducted to identify relevant clinical features available from EHRs. The internal and external validation datasets comprised 24,724 and 34,340 patients, respectively. The REDAPM outperformed baseline models in both datasets, achieving ROC-AUC scores of 0.9029±0.008 and 0.7360±0.005, and PR-AUC scores of 0.8124±0.011 and 0.5504±0.009. Ablation and subgroup experiments confirmed the significant contribution of patients' medical history text to the model's performance.

Although porcine-derived collagen hydrolysate predicts in vitro the highest potency for improving glucose metabolism, these effects have not been studied in humans. To evaluate the effects of porcine-derived collagen hydrolysate on continuously monitored glucose concentrations in real-life conditions in individuals with overweight/obesity. Additionally, postprandial responses following a mixed meal test were examined. Fifty-six men and women participated in this randomized placebo-controlled parallel trial. After a two-week run-in period, participants consumed daily for four weeks 10 g porcine-derived collagen hydrolysate or placebo (erythritol). The primary outcome parameter was the interstitial glucose area under the curve (AUC) during daytime (07:00 to 22:00) measured during three consecutive days. In addition, glycemic variability (GV) was quantified. For this, a continuous glucose monitor (Freestyle Libre ProiQ, Wiesbaden, Germany) was used at the end of the run-in and intervention periods. Postprandial glucose, insulin, and triacylglycerol concentrations were also evaluated after a mixed meal tolerance test. Furthermore, fasting glucose, insulin, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), homeostatic model assessment for insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), HOMA of β-cell function (HOMA-β), and triacylglycerol changes were analyzed. Physical activity profiles and dietary intakes were monitored to exclude confounding by these lifestyle factors. Collagen hydrolysate consumption did not significantly affect daytime interstitial glucose AUC concentrations (95%CI for the effect size: -5.1, 30.0 mmol/(L∗h); p-value = 0.159), but increased several GV metrics: standard deviation (95%CI: 0.0, 0.2 mmol/L; p-value = 0.011), continuous overall net glycemic action (CONGA-4) (95%CI: 0.1, 0.4 mmol/L; p-value = 0.015), coefficient of variation (95%CI: 0.1, 3.0 %; p-value = 0.036), M-value (95%CI: 0.2, 1.8; p-value = 0.036), and mean amplitude of glycemic excursions (MAGE) (95%CI: 0.2, 1.8 mmol/L; p-value = 0.036). Furthermore, the postprandial glucose AUC after the mixed meal test significantly increased (95%CI: 0, 103 mmol/L∗4-h; p-value = 0.049), as well as fasting insulin concentrations (p-value = 0.005), HOMA-IR (p-value = 0.008), and HOMA-β (p-value = 0.009). Other parameters, anthropometrics, physical activity, and energy/nutrient intakes were not significantly changed. Four-week collagen hydrolysate intake did not change free-living glucose concentrations, but increased GV, postprandial glucose AUC, fasting insulin, HOMA-IR, and HOMA-β. However, these changes were small with limited clinical relevance. Therefore, it can be concluded that this porcine-derived collagen hydrolysate does not improve glucose metabolism or other cardiometabolic risk markers.

The univariate and multivariate Cox hazard models were employed to analyze the effects of CRP or PALB on overall survival (OS) and recurrence-free survival (RFS). The optimal cut-off value for preoperative CRP or PALB was 5.94, which was derived from the receiver operating characteristic curve. In comparison with traditional inflammatory indices, CRP or PALB had the highest area under the time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve (0.693 for 3-y OS, 0.664 for 3-y RFS, 0.662 for 5-y OS, and 0.670 for 5-y RFS), all with P < 0.05. However, when compared with neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio, the predictive power of CRP or PALB was not significant for 3-y RFS (P = 0.085).

However, the U-Net model gets 69.17% and 25.55% better precision and F1-score results than the DeepLabv3 + model. The difference in the IoU results of the models was not statistically significant. This paper comprehensively evaluated the DeepLabv3 + model and compared it with the U-Net model. Our experimental findings indicated that DeepLabv3 + outperforms the U-Net model by a substantial margin for both AUC and recall metrics. According to those results, for detecting apical lesions, we encourage researchers to use and improve the DeepLabv3 + model. The DeepLabv3 + model has the poten tial to improve clinical diagnosis and treatment planning and save time in the clinic.","2025","Clinical oral investigations"

We compared the ability of three commonly used neuroimaging modalities to detect cortical changes in PD patients with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI) and dementia (PDD). 53 cognitively normal PD patients (PD-CN), 32 PD-MCI, and 35 PDD underwent concurrent structural MRI (sMRI), diffusion-weighted MRI (dMRI), and [18F]FDG PET. We extracted grey matter volumes (sMRI), mean diffusivity (MD, dMRI), and standardized uptake value ratios ([18F]FDG PET) for 52 cortical regions included in a neuroanatomical atlas. We assessed group differences using ANCOVA models and further applied a cross-validated machine learning approach to identify the modality-specific brain regions that are most indicative of dementia status and assessed their diagnostic accuracy for group separation using receiver operating characteristic analyses. In sMRI, atrophy of temporal and posterior-parietal areas allowed separating PDD from PD-CN (AUC = 0.77 ± 0.07), but diagnostic accuracy was poor for separating PD-MCI from PD-CN (0.57 ± 0.10). dMRI showed most pronounced diffusivity changes in the medial temporal lobe, which provided excellent diagnostic performance for PDD (AUC = 0.87 ± 0.06), and a more modest but still significant performance for PD-MCI (AUC = 0.71 ± 0.09). Finally, [18F]FDG PET revealed pronounced hypometabolism in posterior-occipital regions, which provided the highest diagnostic accuracies for both PDD (AUC = 0.89 ± 0.05) and PD-MCI (AUC = 0.78 ± 0.05). In statistical comparisons, both [18F]FDG PET (p < 0.001) and dMRI (p < 0.031) outperformed sMRI for detecting PDD and PD-MCI. Among the tested modalities, [18F]FDG PET was most accurate for detecting cortical changes associated with cognitive impairment in PD, especially at early stages. Diffusion measurements may represent a promising MRI-based alternative.","2025","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging"

Men with CPG1 and CPG2 disease selecting active surveillance (AS) were included into STRATCANS and allocated to one of three increasing follow-up intensities. Outcome measures were: (i) treatment for CPG≥3 progression (main outcome), (ii) any treatment, (iii) conversion to watchful waiting (WW), (iv) patient self-attrition, and (v) mortality. A total of 297 men (median age 66.0 years) were reviewed. The median (interquartile range, mean) follow-up for men still on AS was 4.9 (2.7-7.6, 5.3) years. In the cohort, 38.0% were CPG2 and 25.0% Grade Group (GG) 2 at AS entry. Overall, 214/297 (72.1%) remained treatment free: 158 (53.1%) were still on AS, 17 (5.7%) died of other causes, and 39 (13.1%) progressed to WW/discharge. Only 10 (3.4%) left AS from anxiety. There were no cancer deaths or metastatic events. In all, 80 men (26.9%) converted to treatment due to biopsy/MRI progression but only 35 (11.7%) of these reached CPG≥3 disease. Treatment for CPG≥3 occurred in 7.6% of CPG1 and 18.5% of CPG2 disease and 9.9% of GG1 and 17.5% of GG2 disease. By STRATCANS tier, treatment for CPG≥3 disease was 4.7% in STRATCANS 1, 12.9% in STRATCANS 2, and 27.4% in STRATCANS 3 (P < 0.001). STRATCANS had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.74 for predicting CPG≥3 progression out-performing stratification by GG (AUC 0.64), CPG (0.69) and Likert score (0.51) alone or a combination of MRI visibility and GG (0.64). Longitudinal data have allowed further refinement of the STRATCANS schedule. The STRATCANS 5-year outcomes demonstrate that a simple risk stratified surveillance using a prognostically meaningful endpoint is safe, durable, has low treatment rates, high patient compliance and appropriately tailors monitoring based on risks of progression.

However, since 2011, there have been increasing reports of its re-emergence, alongside dengue outbreaks in southern Egyptian governorates, raising significant public health concerns. This study aimed to model the current and future distribution of Ae. aegypti in Egypt. Local occurrence data were integrated with bioclimatic, anthropogenic and biological environmental variables to identify key factors influencing the distribution of Ae. aegypti. Maximum entropy (MaxEnt) modelling demonstrated strong predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] mean = 0.975; true skill statistic [TSS] mean = 0.789). The key determinants of habitat suitability were identified as human population density, annual precipitation and the normalised difference vegetation index (NDVI). Current predictions indicate that suitable habitats for Ae. aegypti are concentrated in the Nile Valley, Nile Delta, Fayoum Basin, Red Sea coast and South Sinai. Projections under future climate change scenarios suggest an expansion of suitable habitats, particularly in the Nile Delta region. By 2050, the model predicts a 61%-68% increase in suitable habitat area, with a further 64%-69% increase by 2070, depending on the future climate scenarios. These findings are crucial for informing vector control and disease prevention strategies, particularly considering Egypt's status as one of the world's leading tourist destinations.","2025","Medical and veterinary entomology"

To extend previous pilot findings of the Equine Utrecht University Scale for Facial Assessment of Pain in Foals (EQUUS-FAP FOAL). Prospective blinded case-control study (known groups analysis). Video recordings (30-60 s) of n = 100 foals (38 patients and 62 controls) were collected. Videos were randomised and scored by two observers, blinded for the condition of the animals. Inter- and intra-observer agreement was tested by Intra Class Correlation (ICC) analysis. Differences between patients and controls were tested using Mann-Whitney U test, differences before and after analgesic treatment were tested with Wilcoxon signed rank test. Multilevel binomial logistic regression was performed for statistical weighting of each pain scale item. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was performed to determine sensitivity, specificity and cut-off values. EQUUS-FAP FOAL showed good inter- and intra-observer reliability (ICC coefficient of 0.85 and 0.90 respectively, p < 0.001). Patients had significantly higher pain scores (median score 7, IQR 5.3-7.5) compared with controls (median score 2.5, IQR 1-3, p < 0.001) and the patient pain scores decreased after analgesic treatment (median score 6.5, IQR 5-8 vs. median score 4.5, IQR 3.5-6.5, p < 0.05). Multilevel binomial logistic regression showed the relative importance of the individual scale items. Using the original scale, sensitivity and specificity were 88.2% (95% CI 76%-96%) and 87.9% (81%-98%) respectively, with an area under the ROC curve of 94.9% (92%-98%), based on a cut-off value of ≥4. These values remained similar with the weighted scale based on logistic regression output. Videos of included patients were short and acquired by a person in front of the stable. The current study shows that EQUUS-FAP FOAL can be effectively used to assess acute pain in young foals.","2025","Equine veterinary journal"

However, the manual analysis of mammographic images is time-consuming and requires specialized expertise, presenting substantial challenges in medical practice. To address these challenges, we introduce a CNN-Transformer based model tailored for breast cancer classification through mammographic analysis. This model leverages both prior and current images to monitor temporal changes, aiming to enhance the efficiency and accuracy (ACC) of computer-aided diagnosis systems by mimicking the detailed examination process of radiologists. In this study, our proposed model incorporates a novel integration of a position-wise feedforward network and multi-head self-attention, enabling it to detect abnormal or cancerous changes in mammograms over time. Additionally, the model employs positional encoding and channel attention methods to accurately highlight critical spatial features, thus precisely differentiating between normal and cancerous tissues. Our methodology utilizes focal loss (FL) to precisely address challenging instances that are difficult to classify, reducing false negatives and false positives to improve diagnostic ACC. We compared our model with eight baseline models; specifically, we utilized only current images for the single model ResNet50 while employing both prior and current images for the remaining models in terms of accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), precision (PRE), specificity (SPE), F1 score, and area under the curve (AUC). The results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the baseline models, achieving an ACC of 90.80%, SEN of 90.80%, PRE of 90.80%, SPE of 90.88%, an F1 score of 90.95%, and an AUC of 92.58%. The codes and related information are available at https://github.com/NabaviLab/PCTM. Our proposed CNN-Transformer model integrates both prior and current images, removes long-range dependencies, and enhances its capability for nuanced classification. The application of FL reduces false positive rate (FPR) and false negative rates (FNR), improving both SEN and SPE. Furthermore, the model achieves the lowest false discovery rate and FNR across various abnormalities, including masses, calcification, and architectural distortions (ADs). These low error rates highlight the model's reliability and underscore its potential to improve early breast cancer detection in clinical practice.","2025","Medical physics"

We measured plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau181, amyloid beta (Aβ)1-40, Aβ1-42, and neurofilament light chain in research and real-world cohorts. Participants were categorized by brain amyloid status using US Food and Drug Administration/European Medicines Agency-approved CSF or PET methods. Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ1-42 demonstrated superior accuracy in detecting brain amyloid pathologies, with area under the curve from 0.94 to 0.97 in all cohorts. Specificity was lower in the real-world cohort but improved significantly by integrating demographic and clinical factors, aligning performance with research cohorts. Additionally, plasma biomarkers exhibited strong correlations with their CSF counterparts and PET standardized uptake value ratios, with significant associations in amyloid-positive participants. Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ1-42 are effective diagnostic tools. However, patient demographics, apolipoprotein E ε4 status, and cognitive condition must be considered to improve specificity in the clinical practice. Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217 and p-tau217/amyloid beta (Aβ)1-42 demonstrated exceptional accuracy (area under the curve: 0.94-0.97) in detecting brain amyloid pathologies across both research (Southern China Aging Brain Initiative [SCABI]-1, SCABI-2) and real-world clinical practice (RCP) cohorts. Incorporating patient-specific factors (sex, age, apolipoprotein E ε4, cognitive status) improved diagnostic specificity in the clinical RCP cohort, aligning its performance with that of research cohorts. Plasma biomarkers, particularly p-tau217 and their ratios, showed robust correlations with cerebrospinal fluid biomarkers and positron emission tomography amyloid standardized uptake value ratios, underscoring their value as non-invasive diagnostic alternatives. Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau217/Aβ1-42 proved highly effective in diagnosing amyloid burden, offering a practical solution to bridge research advancements with real-world clinical practice.","2025","Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association"

This quantitative cross-sectional study involved one hundred and fifty transfusion-dependent patients with β-thalassemia major who were evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging to obtain T2* values, left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and left ventricular ejection fraction. The relationship between cardiac R2* values and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and left ventricular ejection fraction was analyzed. Out of the 150 patients, cardiac iron overload was not observed for 92 patients, 42 patients exhibited mild to moderate cardiac iron overload, and 16 patients were severe cardiac iron overloaded. A linear correlation was not observed between the cardiac R2* values and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and left ventricular ejection fraction (P > 0.05). For the left ventricular ejection fraction index, the sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, and the agreement rate were 83.3%, 63.2%, 8.6%, 98.9%, and 64.0%, respectively; also, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.348. A linear correlation was not observed between cardiac R2* values and left ventricular end-diastolic volume index, left ventricular end-systolic volume index, and left ventricular ejection fraction in patients with β-thalassemia major. Therefore, using left ventricular ejection fraction as an indirect index to predict cardiac iron deposition may be not reliable in clinical practice.","2025","Science progress"

The degree of shoulder stiffness, a critical feature of frozen shoulder, likely reflects the severity of the condition but currently lacks standardized, objective assessment methods. (1) What are the releasing forces in patients with frozen shoulder, and do the forces vary across different stages of frozen shoulder? (2) Are there differences in postoperative outcomes of manipulation under anesthesia among patients with frozen shoulder at different stages of the condition? (3) Is a higher releasing force associated with poorer outcomes of manipulation, and what threshold of releasing force is optimal for better outcomes? (4) What clinical factors influence the magnitude of releasing forces? This prospective cohort study included patients with primary unilateral frozen shoulder who underwent manipulation under anesthesia after at least 3 months of unsuccessful nonsurgical treatment, which was defined as progressive worsening ROM, failure to make progress, or residual functional impairment after 3 months of treatment. Between December 1, 2022, and December 31, 2023, we treated 280 patients with unilateral frozen shoulder, all of whom were considered potentially eligible for this study. The inclusion criteria were: a reduction of passive external rotation in the affected shoulder to less than 50% compared with the contralateral side, at least 3 months of unsuccessful nonsurgical treatment, absence of shoulder trauma, radiographs and MRI showing no other pathologic lesions in the shoulder, and no prior medical history in the contralateral shoulder. The exclusion criteria were patients who had previously undergone shoulder surgery, those who had bilateral frozen shoulder, patients with anesthesia intolerance, and those with incomplete preoperative assessments. One hundred fifty-six patients were enrolled in follow-up assessments at 1, 3, and 6 months after manipulation. The mean ± SD age for enrolled patients was 54 ± 8 years, 35% (55 of 156) of all participants were male, and the mean BMI was 23 ± 3 kg/m2. Two percent (3 of 156) withdrew consent, and 4% (7 of 156) were lost to follow-up, leaving 94% (146 of 156) for analysis. The contralateral unaffected shoulder was used as a self-control. During the manipulation process, the force-time curves for the affected and unaffected shoulders were sequentially recorded using a handheld dynamometer, following the order of forward flexion, external rotation, and internal rotation. Two key force values, an initial tear value and a peak value, were extracted from the curve for the affected shoulder, while only the peak value was recorded for the unaffected shoulder. Passive ROM, the Oxford shoulder score (OSS), and the VAS were evaluated at the baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months postoperatively. Patients were categorized into four stages according to the patient-reported duration of pain: Stage 1 (0 to 3 months), Stage 2 (3 to 9 months), Stage 3 (9 to 15 months), and Stage 4 (> 15 months). To address our first and second questions, we used ANOVA for multistage comparisons of continuous variables, followed by a post hoc Tukey test for pairwise comparisons. For the third question, we performed univariate regression to analyze the correlation between factors like age, sex, symptom duration, frozen shoulder stage, preoperative ROM, upper arm circumference, fat-free mass, diabetes, thyroid disease, hyperlipidemia, tear value, peak value, and 6-month postoperative ROM, VAS, and the OSS. Factors with p < 0.05 were included in a multivariate regression. A tear value threshold of poor ROM outcomes was evaluated with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the Youden index. For the fourth question, we used similar regression models to examine potential factors associated with the releasing force, focusing on both tear and peak values. Pairwise comparisons in this subgroup analysis were performed using the Student t-test. All p values less than 0.05 were considered significant. Tear values of each stage were as follows: 25 ± 13 N in Stage 2, 28 ± 15 N in Stage 3, and 38 ± 18 N in Stage 4. The tear value for patients in Stage 4 was higher compared with both Stage 2 and Stage 3 (Stage 4 versus Stage 2, mean difference 13 [95% CI 6 to 20]; p < 0.001; Stage 4 versus Stage 3, mean difference 10 [95% CI 2 to 19]; p = 0.01). Patients in Stage 4 exhibited an increased peak value relative to the other two stages (Stage 4 versus Stage 2, mean difference 11 [95% CI 2 to 20]; p = 0.02; Stage 4 versus Stage 3, mean difference 8 [95% CI 0 to 16]; p = 0.04). The peak value in the affected shoulder was higher than that in the unaffected (mean difference 40 [95% CI 36 to 44] in forward flexion; p < 0.001). At the 6-month endpoint after manipulation, patients in Stage 2 and 3 showed greater ROM in forward flexion than those in Stage 4 (Stage 2 versus Stage 4, mean difference 12 [95% CI 9 to 14]; p < 0.001; Stage 3 versus Stage 4, mean difference 14 [95% CI 11 to 17]; p < 0.001) and a lower OSS than those in Stage 4 (Stage 2 versus Stage 4, mean difference -8 [95% CI -9 to -7]; p < 0.001; Stage 3 versus Stage 4, mean difference -7 [95% CI -8 to -6]; p < 0.001). Two factors were associated with the OSS at the 6-month endpoint: increased tear value (β = 0.47; p = 0.004) and diabetes (β = 0.28; p = 0.02). The optimal thresholds for predicting a forward flexion at least 164° at 6 months was a tear value of 53 N (area under curve [AUC] 0.79 [95% CI 0.68 to 0.91]). Patients with a tear value of below 53 N demonstrated better postoperative ROM (mean difference 10 [95% CI 3 to 16]; p = 0.004) and OSS (mean difference -4 [95% CI -8 to 0]; p = 0.04). The tear value was associated with male sex (β = 0.36; p = 0.03) and ROM in flexion (β = 0.20; p = 0.049), whereas peak value was associated with male sex (β = 0.45; p = 0.001) and diabetes (β = 0.16; p = 0.048). These findings suggest that performing manipulation before reaching Stage 4 may result in more favorable outcomes for patients, and evaluating shoulder stiffness by measuring releasing force proved to be feasible.

Assessing the risk of relapse in patients with BD can assist in identifying populations at high risk for recurrence, and early feasible interventions can improve patient' prognoses. Therefore, it is important to establish and validate predictive models for relapse risk in patients with BD. We used 303 patients with BD admitted to the Anhui Mental Health Center as a retrospective training cohort and 81 patients from the Wuhu Fourth People's Hospital as an external validation cohort. We collected a multidimensional assessment of the characteristics of patients eligible for enrollment, including general demographic characteristics, medical history, treatment, and assessment of selected scales. At the same time, they were followed up for 1 year after reaching the recovery standard after treatment. Depending on whether their symptoms returned within a year, patients with BD were divided into recurrent and non-recurrent groups. Recurrence risk factors for BD were selected using univariate and binary logistic regression analyses based on the clinical data of the patients and other pertinent information. A nomogram model was developed to predict the incidence of BD relapse. To further assess the model fit and dependability, calibration curves, working curves of subject attributes, and decision curves were also employed. A total of 384 patients with BD were enrolled in this study, of whom 250(65.1%) had non-recurrent episodes and 134(34.9%) had recurrent episodes. Of these, 96 (31.7%) had relapses at the Anhui Mental Health Centre and 38 (46.9%) at the Fourth People's Hospital of Wuhu City. According to the results of univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses, the number of prior episodes (odds ratio [OR]: 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.179-1.615), Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS) score (OR: 1.303, 95% CI: 1.027-1.652), Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) (OR: 1.476, 95% CI: 1.29-1.689), Number of visits(OR: 0.768, 95% CI: 0.684-0.863), suicidal behaviors (OR: 5.54, 95% CI: 1.818-16.881) and the electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) (OR: 0.382, 95% CI: 0.156-0.94) were independent risk factors for relapse in patients with BD. An analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration curve, and clinical decision curve further revealed that the predictive efficiency and degree of fit between the predicted value of the nomogram and the actual observed value were better. This study found that the number of previous episodes, SDSS score, PSQI score and suicidal behaviors were independent risk factors for relapse of BD, while the number of visits and ECT were protective factor. Based on these factors, we developed and validated a nomogram for predicting relapse in patients with BD; that has clinical reference values.","2024","Frontiers in psychiatry"

A two-analysis retrospective study was performed. The first analysis examined the degree to which better-ear PTA4 alone, THS-H alone, and better-ear PTA4 in conjunction with THS-H predicted performance on a speech-in-noise test, the modified rhyme test. Three binomial mixed-effects models were fitted using better-ear PTA4 alone, THS-H alone, and both measures as primary predictors of interest. Age and sex were included as covariates in all models. The models were compared to one another using Chi-square goodness-of-fit tests and the best-fitting model was examined. Data from 5988 SMs were analyzed in the first analysis. The second analysis examined the degree to which better-ear PTA4 alone, THS-H alone, and better-ear PTA4 in conjunction with THS-H predicted two hearing aid-related outcomes: recommendation for hearing aids by a clinician and hearing aid use. Three receiver operating characteristic curves were fit for each question for better-ear PTA4 alone, THS-H alone, and better-ear PTA4 + THS-H. The area under the curve was bootstrapped to generate confidence intervals to compare the three measures. Data from 8001 SMs were analyzed in the second analysis. In the first analysis, all three models explained more variance than chance; however, the better-ear PTA4 + THS-H model was a significantly better fit than either the better-ear PTA4 alone or the THS-H alone models. Significant main effects of better-ear PTA4 and THS-H indicated that proportion correct decreased as better-ear PTA4 and THS-H increased. A significant interaction was observed such that proportion correct decreased more rapidly if both better-ear PTA4 and THS-H were increasing in tandem. In the second analysis, better-ear PTA4 + THS-H showed good predictive discrimination of a prior hearing aid recommendation. For predicting hearing aid use, better-ear PTA4 was the only predictor with an area under the curve bootstrapped confidence interval that overlapped 0.50, indicating better-ear PTA4 alone is a chance predictor for hearing aid use. Both THS-H alone and better-ear PTA4 + THS-H predicted hearing aid use better than chance, but had poor discrimination overall. Adding the THS-H to the better-ear PTA4 improves predictions of speech intelligibility in noise, has good predictive strength for hearing aid recommendations, and predicts hearing aid use better than chance. This study provides evidence for using surveys in conjunction with objective data when evaluating hearing ability and recommending interventions. These findings are relevant to discourse regarding self-administered hearing healthcare.","2025","Ear and hearing"

Data from patients who underwent MRI and OST for suspected IA were analyzed. For comparison, a historical healthy control (HC) group with OST was also accounted. MRI findings were quantified using the Rheumatoid Arthritis MRI Score (RAMRIS). Diagnostic accuracy of OST was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC), while correlation analyses were conducted to explore relationships between OST and MRI, as well as disease activity markers. Overall, 71 patients with known rheumatic diseases (n = 1,542 wrist and finger joints) and 114 HC (n = 2,508 joints) subjects were included. 51 patients showed inflammatory signs on MRI (MRI+). These also showed significantly higher OST scores (16.41 ± 5.53) than subjects without MRI inflammation (MRI-) (11.52 ± 5.03) or HC (10.78 ± 4.19) (all; p < 0.001). OST showed significant correlations with RAMRIS-synovitis and tenosynovitis scores in the MRI + group (rho = 0.541, p < 0.001; rho = 0.341, p = 0.01, respectively). Significant correlations were observed between OST and clinical parameters for disease activity. Using MRI as a reference, the best diagnostic value of OST was observed at the wrist level in the MRI + group, by an AUC of 0.833 (95%CI 0.700-0.966). OST showed an excellent performance compared to MRI and correlated significantly with RAMRIS scores and clinical parameters in IA patients, also differentiating IA from HC.","2025","Arthritis research & therapy"

Recent research has explored the biological mechanisms of PPD, particularly neuroactive steroids (NAS). We sought here to investigate associations between NAS levels and ratios during pregnancy and the subsequent development of depressive symptoms with postpartum onset. NAS levels and psychological scales were measured in individuals with and without mood disorders at up to eight visits across pregnancy and postpartum. Generalized linear mixed-effects regression models were used to assess relationships in euthymic pregnant individuals between each of the NAS biomarkers and ratios and subsequent PPD. Participants with a one-unit increase in the log isoallopregnanolone/pregnanolone ratio at the third trimester (T3) had higher odds (OR = 1.64, 95% CI: 1.13-2.37, FDR adjusted p = 0.038, C-index = 0.82), and those with a one-unit increase in the log pregnanolone/progesterone ratio at T3 had lower odds (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.47-0.88, FDR adjusted p = 0.036, C-index = 0.82) of developing PPD; those with a one-unit increase in the log progesterone level at T3 had higher odds of developing PPD (OR = 4.00, 95% CI: 1.54-10.37, FDR adjusted p = 0.035, C-index = 0.80). We found key differences in the progesterone metabolic pathway at the third trimester, indicating likely decreased activity/expression of the 3α-HSD enzyme and/or increased activity/expression of 3β-HSD.","2025","Neuropsychopharmacology : official publication of the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology"

Here, we analyzed data from 48,367 UK Biobank participants with proteomic profiling. Using Cox and generalized linear models, we examined the longitudinal associations between proteomic signatures and dementia-related phenotypes. Mendelian randomization analysis was employed to identify causal associations, and machine learning algorithms were applied to develop protein-based models for dementia prediction. We identified 74 proteins significantly associated with the risk of various types of dementia and cognitive functions after Bonferroni correction. Among these, strong associations were observed for growth/differentiation factor 15 (GDF15), glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and neurofilament light polypeptide (NEFL), across all types of dementia. Additionally, 15 proteins demonstrated significant associations with neuroimaging-defined dementia endophenotypes. Two-sample Mendelian randomization analyses further substantiated causal relationships between dementia-associated proteins and Alzheimer's disease, particularly involving GDF15, proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase receptor Ret (RET), and GFAP. Moreover, we identified three protein modules associated with dementia, primarily linked to immune system processes, angiogenesis, and energy metabolism, providing insights into potential biological pathways underlying the disease. Furthermore, we proposed a ten-protein panel capable of forecasting dementia over a median follow-up period of 8.6 years, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.857 (95% confidence interval (CI), 0.837-0.876). Our results revealed dementia-associated plasma proteomic signatures, and their causal relationships, notably GDF15-RET signaling with Alzheimer's disease, and proposed a promising protein panel for high-risk dementia screening.","2025","Molecular neurobiology"

However, forest fires threaten this balance, making the identification of forest fire probability (FFP) areas crucial for effective mitigation. This study assesses forest fire trends and susceptibility in the Similipal Biosphere Reserve (SBR) from 2012 to 2023 using four machine learning models-extreme gradient boosting tree (XGBTree), AdaBag, random forest (RF), and gradient boosting machine (GBM). A forest fire inventory was created using the delta normalized burn ratio (dNBR) index, and 19 conditioning factors were incorporated after rigorous collinearity testing. FFP maps were generated and evaluated using ROC-AUC, MAE, MSE, and RMSE metrics. The frequency ratio (FR) model was also applied to assess the importance of variables. The results show that approximately 40.85% of the study area is high to very high susceptible to forest fires, with the RF model achieving the highest accuracy (AUC = 0.965). An average analysis across all models revealed that high susceptibility areas accounted for 23.08% of the study area, the largest among all classes. Moderate susceptibility zones covered 16.19%, while very high susceptibility areas comprised 18.23%. Interestingly, very low and low susceptibility zones together represented 42.50%, indicating a large portion of the area is at relatively low fire risk. Temporal analysis identified 2021 as the peak year for fire incidents, with 94.72% of the fires occurring during March and April. The buffer zone experienced the highest number of incidents, with a significant anthropogenic influence. Using the FR model, variable importance analysis showed that land use and land cover (LULC), NDVI, and NDMI were the most influential factors in fire susceptibility. This study contributes to forest fire management by integrating the dNBR index with machine learning models and FR analysis to generate precise FFP maps. These findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and conservationists, enabling targeted interventions in high-risk zones and enhancing fire management strategies to reduce the impact of forest fires.","2025","Environmental science and pollution research international"

A total of 381 patients with ESCC who underwent nCRT at three medical centers were retrospectively enrolled. The ypN categories were scored according to the eighth edition of the American Joint Committee of Cancer (AJCC) staging manual. LNs with regression changes or vital tumor cells were used for interpretation of the prepN stage, reflecting the estimated number of originally involved LNs. BALN category was organized on the basis of the sum of the number of positive LNs in prepN and ypN categories. BALN category revealed clearer survival classification and prognostic value of disease-free survival (DFS) in patients with ESCC (p < 0.0001). Multivariate cox proportional risk model identified BALN stage as a significant risk factor of DFS of patients with ESCC (p < 0.001). The results of 5-year time-area under the curve (AUC) demonstrated better predictive ability of the BALN category than the ypN category (AUC 0.755 versus 0.707, p = 0.004). The rypTNM system based on BALN category exhibited comparable survival discrimination and better predictive performance than ypTNM system (AUC 0.799 versus 0.756, p = 0.020). The BALN stage and the revised ypTNM system showed preferable prognosis outcomes to the ypN stage and the ypTNM system, respectively.

We aimed to identify blood proteins associated with and predictive of ILA among relatives of patients with pulmonary fibrosis. Relatives enrolled in two independent cohorts had protein levels measured using an aptamer-based proteomic platform. ILA was assessed with CT scans per Fleischner Society recommendations. Protein associations with ILA were assessed using regression, and significant proteins were used with clinical variables to detect ILA. Of 237 relatives from two independent cohorts, 26% had ILA. Seven proteins were associated with ILA in the discovery cohort after FDR-adjustment, and all remained significant after adjusting for age, gender, and smoking status. Six of seven were significant in the validation cohort including GDF15, SFTPD, and SFTPB. In a multivariable model, six proteins combined with basic demographics in the discovery cohort had AUC=0.92 (0.88 in validation cohort). LASSO modelling identified three proteins and age as predictors with an AUC=0.89. When applied to the combined cohorts, this simple model would reduce the need for CT imaging in one of every three relatives screened. Peripheral blood proteins are associated with ILA in relatives of patients with pulmonary fibrosis and can be used to detect ILA. Our findings demonstrate the potential utility of blood biomarkers in this high-risk group and suggests molecular targets for future investigation.","2025","The European respiratory journal"

The tumor markers des-gamma-carboxy prothrombin (DCP) and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) are crucial for HCC diagnosis and prognosis. However, their roles in the modern era of HCC epidemiology require reevaluation. This multi-institutional retrospective study analyzed 1515 patients who underwent hepatectomy for primary HCC. Patients were classified into 4 clusters using k-means analysis based on preoperative DCP and AFP levels. Clinicopathologic characteristics, overall survival (OS), and recurrence rate (RR) were evaluated using Cox proportional hazards models and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) comparisons. Cluster 3 (concurrent elevations of DCP and AFP) had the poorest 5-year OS (52.8%) and the highest RR (79.3%), whereas cluster 4 (low levels of both markers) had the most favorable outcomes, with a 5-year OS rate of 71.5% and an RR of 55.7%. Cluster 1 (elevated DCP alone) was associated with larger tumors (median of 45 mm) and more frequent vascular invasion (43%) than cluster 2 (elevated AFP alone, median tumor size of 24 mm, and vascular invasion of 36%). DCP was a stronger predictor of 5-year OS in patients with preserved liver function (AUROC, 0.63), whereas AFP was more effective in stratifying RR in patients with impaired liver function (AUROC, 0.57). Non-B, non-C hepatitis (NBNC)-related HCC exhibited a distinct biomarker profile, with an elevated DCP level correlating with a higher 5-year RR (67%) than other etiologies. Our study introduces tumor marker clustering as a novel analytical approach, providing a nuanced understanding of AFP and DCP's combined utility in predicting prognosis and recurrence. Our findings highlight the independent and complementary roles of these biomarkers, particularly in NBNC-related HCC and in cases with impaired liver function. AFP and DCP remain crucial tools for recurrence risk assessment, guiding personalized management strategies, such as surveillance, neoadjuvant therapies, and tailored postoperative interventions.","2025","Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract"

The understanding of the transcriptional changes with respect to high-risk clinical/histopathological features and outcome is poor. Here, we examine stage-matched, outcome-differentiated cSCC using whole exome and transcriptome sequencing. Exome analysis identified key driver mutations including TP53, CDKN2A, NOTCH1, SHC4, MIIP, CNOT1, C17orf66, LPHN2, and TTC16 and pathway enrichment of driver mutations in replicative senescence, cellular response to UV, cell-cell adhesion, and cell cycle. Transcriptomic analysis identified pathway enrichment of immune signaling/inflammation, cell-cycle pathways, extracellular matrix function, and chromatin function. Integrative analysis identified 183 critical genes in carcinogenesis and were used to develop a gene expression panel (GEP) for outcome. Three outcome-related gene clusters included those involved in keratinization, cell division, and metabolism. We found 16 genes whose expression may be associated with metastasis (risk score ≥ 9 Met & risk score < 9 NoMet) with an AUC of 97.1%, sensitivity 95.5%, specificity 85.7%, and overall accuracy of 90%.

In this study, we utilized single-cell sequencing to dissect the intricate landscape of gastric cancer, identifying diverse cell populations and their interactions. We focused on the role of β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb)-associated genes and their impact on the tumor microenvironment. By analyzing 189,700 single-cell profiles, we identified four distinct malignant epithelial cell subpopulations characterized by unique gene expression patterns. Among these, 20 β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb)-associated genes were identified, including key genes such as MRPL13, LDHB, COX6C, FABP5, and RPS13, which were significantly associated with immune infiltration and tumor microenvironment remodeling. Hierarchical clustering based on these genes classified gastric cancer patients into two subgroups with distinct prognostic outcomes. Patients in the high-risk subgroup exhibited increased expression of pro-tumor genes and reduced immune infiltration, correlating with poorer survival. We further constructed a robust risk scoring model incorporating these genes, achieving AUC values of 0.72, 0.69, and 0.66 for predicting 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival in the TCGA dataset. These findings underscore the prognostic value of Kbhb-associated genes and their potential as therapeutic targets.

Due to their insidious onset and impact on critical functional areas of the brain, these tumors often result in irreversible abnormalities in growth and development, as well as cognitive and motor impairments in affected children. Therefore, early diagnosis through advanced screening techniques is vital for improving patient outcomes and quality of life. This study aimed to investigate the application of facial recognition technology in the early detection of iGCTs in children and adolescents. Early diagnosis through advanced screening techniques is vital for improving patient outcomes and quality of life. A multicenter, phased approach was adopted for the development and validation of a deep learning model, GVisageNet, dedicated to the screening of midline brain tumors from normal controls (NCs) and iGCTs from other midline brain tumors. The study comprised the collection and division of datasets into training (n=847, iGCTs=358, NCs=300, other midline brain tumors=189) and testing (n=212, iGCTs=79, NCs=70, other midline brain tumors=63), with an additional independent validation dataset (n=336, iGCTs=130, NCs=100, other midline brain tumors=106) sourced from 4 medical institutions. A regression model using clinically relevant, statistically significant data was developed and combined with GVisageNet outputs to create a hybrid model. This integration sought to assess the incremental value of clinical data. The model's predictive mechanisms were explored through correlation analyses with endocrine indicators and stratified evaluations based on the degree of hypothalamic-pituitary-target axis damage. Performance metrics included area under the curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. On the independent validation dataset, GVisageNet achieved an AUC of 0.938 (P<.01) in distinguishing midline brain tumors from NCs. Further, GVisageNet demonstrated significant diagnostic capability in distinguishing iGCTs from the other midline brain tumors, achieving an AUC of 0.739, which is superior to the regression model alone (AUC=0.632, P<.001) but less than the hybrid model (AUC=0.789, P=.04). Significant correlations were found between the GVisageNet's outputs and 7 endocrine indicators. Performance varied with hypothalamic-pituitary-target axis damage, indicating a further understanding of the working mechanism of GVisageNet. GVisageNet, capable of high accuracy both independently and with clinical data, shows substantial potential for early iGCTs detection, highlighting the importance of combining deep learning with clinical insights for personalized health care.","2025","Journal of medical Internet research"

Early identification of high-risk patients is essential to reduce complications, improve outcomes, and guide clinical decision-making. This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning (ML)-based model for predicting in-hospital GIB in patients with AMI, identify key risk factors, and evaluate the clinical applicability of the model for risk stratification and decision support. A multicenter retrospective cohort study was conducted, including 1910 patients with AMI from the Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong Medical University (2005-2024). Patients were divided into training (n=1575) and testing (n=335) cohorts based on admission dates. For external validation, 1746 patients with AMI were included in the publicly available MIMIC-IV (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV) database. Propensity score matching was adjusted for demographics, and the Boruta algorithm identified key predictors. A total of 7 ML algorithms-logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machine, decision tree, random forest (RF), extreme gradient boosting, and neural networks-were trained using 10-fold cross-validation. The models were evaluated for the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1-score, and decision curve analysis. Shapley additive explanations analysis ranked variable importance. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis evaluated the impact of GIB on short-term survival. Multivariate logistic regression assessed the relationship between coronary heart disease (CHD) and in-hospital GIB after adjusting for clinical variables. The RF model outperformed other ML models, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.77 in the training cohort, 0.77 in the testing cohort, and 0.75 in the validation cohort. Key predictors included red blood cell count, hemoglobin, maximal myoglobin, hematocrit, CHD, and other variables, all of which were strongly associated with GIB risk. Decision curve analysis demonstrated the clinical use of the RF model for early risk stratification. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis showed no significant differences in 7- and 15-day survival rates between patients with AMI with and without GIB (P=.83 for 7-day survival and P=.87 for 15-day survival). Multivariate logistic regression showed that CHD was an independent risk factor for in-hospital GIB (odds ratio 2.79, 95% CI 2.09-3.74). Stratified analyses by sex, age, occupation, marital status, and other subgroups consistently showed that the association between CHD and GIB remained robust across all subgroups. The ML-based RF model provides a robust and clinically applicable tool for predicting in-hospital GIB in patients with AMI. By leveraging routinely available clinical and laboratory data, the model supports early risk stratification and personalized preventive strategies.","2025","Journal of medical Internet research"

Anti-filarial antibody (Ab) markers could be more sensitive than antigen (Ag) point-of-care tests for monitoring LF transmission in some settings. This study aimed to investigate the sensitivity of anti-filarial Abs for detecting signals of LF transmission in Samoa by i) investigating the sensitivity and specificity of Ab to identify Ag-positives; ii) estimating the average number needed to test (NNTestav) to identify LF-seropositives (seropositive for Ag and/or any Ab), and iii) compare the efficiency of the different serological indicators by target age group and sampling design. A community-based serological survey of participants aged ≥5 years was conducted 1.5-3.5 months following the first round of triple-drug mass drug administration in Samoa in 2018, covering 35 primary sampling units (PSUs) (30 randomly selected and five purposively selected 'suspected hotspots'). Ag-positivity was detected using Alere Filariasis Test Strips, and Ab-seropositivity (Bm14, Wb123, Bm33 Abs) were measured using multiplex bead assays. Seroprevalence was adjusted for study design and standardised for age and gender. NNTestav was calculated using the formula 1/p, where p was the adjusted seroprevalence for each subgroup. Of 3795 participants (mean age: 20.7; 51.2% female), 1892 (49.9%) were LF-seropositive. If Ag alone was used to identify LF-seropositives, only 5% (117/1892) would be identified. Of the three Ab seromarkers, Bm14 Ab had the highest area under the Receiver-Operating Characteristic Curve ([ROC]=0.88) to classify participants as Ag-positive, followed by Wb123 Ab (ROC=0.83) and Bm33 Ab (ROC=0.76). Participants aged ≥10 years had lower NNTestav compared to participants aged 5-9 years for all seromarkers. NNTestav was lower in purposively versus randomly selected PSUs. All Ab seromarkers had high ROC values to classify patients as Ag-positive and may be useful tools for LF surveillance in some settings.

The last 20 + years have noted significantly improved safety that has been accompanied by decreasing length of stay and select populations electing for outpatient surgery, leading to continued decreases in cost. Regardless, readmissions and complications still occur, requiring inpatient postoperative care (IP-POC). The current study aimed to identify and characterize at-risk populations for MBS-related IP-POC. The 2015-2021 MBSAQIP (n = 1,346,468 records) was used to extract 973,520 primary cases of laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, duodenal switch, and associated IP-POC. Conversions, pediatric cases, and < 30-day follow-up were excluded. IP-POC severity scores were calculated by summing readmissions (1 point), interventions (5 points), and reoperations (15 points). Risk factors associated with IP-POC were identified using zero-inflated Poisson models. GERD, COPD, smoking, and type of MBS procedure were significantly associated with increased IP-POC incidence and severity. Male sex was associated with increased severity but a lower likelihood of IP-POC, while Black and Hispanic race predicted increased IP-POC likelihood but not severity. ROC curve analysis identified IP-POC score thresholds of ≥ 6 and ≥ 10 as significantly associated with MACE (OR 2.4) and 30-day mortality (OR 4.7). The weighted IP-POC model demonstrated associations between preoperative characteristics and increased IP-POC likelihood and severity.

221,"39883131","Clinical applicability of 2023 International Pediatric Nephrology Association recommended limited therapeutic drug monitoring formulae to assess mycophenolic acid exposure.","The 2023 IPNA guidelines recommended a 12-h mycophenolic acid (MPA) area under the curve (AUC) estimation for managing pediatric nephrotic syndrome and MPA AUC > 50 mg * h/L for an optimal therapeutic response to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF). The IPNA guidelines endorsed two limited AUC formulae based on three-point MPA measurements to predict 12-h MPA AUC. The relative performance of these two limited AUC formulae has not been tested. We analyzed 156 MPA AUCs from 122 stable kidney transplant recipients to predict the 12-h AUC (10 MPA measurements analyzed with trapezoid rule) using the IPNA-recommended three-point Formula 1 and Formula 2. Three-point Formula 1 and Formula 2 classified 69% and 60% limited MPA AUCs as > 50 mg * h/L (difference 8.90%, p = 0.10). Three-point Formula 1 and Formula 2 demonstrated a similar association with 12-h AUC (R2 0.72 vs. 0.71) and exhibited identical areas under ROC (AUROC) for predicting 12-h AUC > 50 mg * h/L (AUROC 0.82, 95% CI 0.75, 0.88 vs. 0.80, 95% CI 0.73, 0.86; p = 0.53). Fixed MMF dose and MPA C0 level showed a relatively weaker association (R2 0.16 and 0.43) with 12-h AUC. Four-point MPA formulae improved the prediction of 12-h AUC compared to the three-point formulae. Among all C0 thresholds, C0 > 3.5 mg/L demonstrated the best prediction of 12-h AUC > 50 mg * h/L (AUROC 0.74, 95% CI 0.66, 0.80).

The goal is to identify the best model for early clinical screening to improve screening accuracy and optimize clinical management strategies. This prospective study collected data from 1208 postpartum women, with the dataset randomly divided into training and testing sets (8:2). Five machine learning algorithms-logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines (SVM), and eXtreme gradient boosting (XGBoost)-were used to construct the PPSUI risk prediction model. Model performance was evaluated using multiple metrics, and the best-performing model was selected and validated for generalizability with the testing set. The final model retained ten features: birth weight, weight gain during pregnancy, BMI before delivery, pre-pregnancy BMI, age of delivery, gestation, parity, pre-delivery uterine height, age of first delivery, and labor analgesia. Among the five algorithms, the random forest model performed best, with a test AUC of 0.995 (95% CI 0.990-0.999, P < 0.05), accuracy of 0.956, precision of 0.957, recall of 0.944, specificity of 0.966, and F1 score of 0.951. The model's high generalizability was confirmed with the testing set and further validated through bootstrapping and tenfold cross-validation. The random forest model shows strong clinical potential for PPSUI risk prediction and early screening. Future studies should expand the sample size and include multi-center data to further enhance the model's clinical applicability.","2025","International urogynecology journal"

Existing risk models developed for deceased-donor LT depend on posttransplant factors and fall short in living-donor LT (LDLT), where pretransplant evaluations are crucial for preventing EAD and justifying the donor's risks. This retrospective study analyzed data from 2944 adult patients who underwent LDLT at 17 centers between 2016 and 2020. We developed a logistic regression model to predict EAD based on this development cohort. We used data from 1020 patients at the King Faisal Transplant Center for external validation. In the development cohort, 321 patients (10.9%) experienced EAD. These patients had poorer health status, more liver decompensation, and higher requirements of hospitalization than those without EAD. Multivariable logistic regression identified independent pretransplant predictors of EAD: laboratory Model for End-Stage Liver Disease score (odds ratio [OR], 1.08; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.06-1.09), the necessity for hospitalization at the time of transplant (OR, 2.58; 95% CI, 2.00-3.30), and graft weight in kilogram (OR, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.17-0.45). Using these predictors, we developed the model for EAD after LDLT, which demonstrated strong discriminative ability in the development cohort with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.71 (95% CI, 0.68-0.74). The model maintained high discrimination during internal validation (AUC, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.67-0.73) and showed a modest reduction in discriminative power in external validation (AUC, 0.65; 95% CI, 0.61-0.68). EAD post-LDLT is influenced by the recipient's pretransplant health condition and the graft weight. Integrating the model for EAD after LDLT into the pretransplant process of pairing donors and recipients can enhance the safety and efficacy of LDLT.","2025","Transplantation"

FC levels may also be influenced by the extent of disease. We aimed to examine the relationships between FC, mucosal activity, and disease extent, and to assess how disease extent affects the diagnostic accuracy of FC. We conducted a single-center observational study of patients with UC. Mucosal inflammatory activity was rated by the Mayo Endoscopic Score (MES) and Nancy Histological Index (NHI). The endoscopic and histological extents of disease were categorized by the Montreal classification and colorectal distribution of histologically active inflammation (NHI ≥ 2), respectively. FC was measured by EliA Calprotectin Enzyme fluoroimmunoassay (Phadia). A total of 518 visits by 254 patients were analyzed. In endoscopically active UC (MES ≥ 2), FC levels were significantly lower in proctitis (440 [IQR: 175-1350] mg/kg) as compared to left-sided colitis (840 [IQR: 298-2011] mg/kg, p = 0.048) or pancolitis (1690 [IQR: 723-2582] mg/kg, p = 0.00005).

Evaluate the utility of Delirium Risk Assessment Score (DRAS), Delirium Risk Assessment Tool (DRAT), and Delirium Elderly At-Risk (DEAR) in patients undergoing posterior lumbar interbody fusions. Surgical interventions can place patients at risk for postoperative delirium (POD), an acute and often severe cognitive impairment associated with poor outcomes. However, common risk assessment tools have not been validated in patients undergoing spine surgery. Adults who underwent posterior lumbar fusion were queried using PearlDiver. Baseline demographics, comorbidities, and delirium occurrence within 7 days of surgery were extracted. Delirium risk scores were calculated using DRAS (15 points total; threshold 5 points), DRAT (8 points total; threshold 3 points), and DEAR (5 points total; threshold 2 points) scales. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated, and optimal risk scores maximizing Youden's Index were established for each measure. Among 37,119 patients, 70 patients (0.2%) developed POD. The mean age was 60.1 y, 56.6% were female, and mean Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) was 2.1. POD patients had lower mean age and percent female sex, but higher mean CCI and percent medical comorbidities (all P<0.05). ROC curve analyses revealed that a DRAS score of 5 (Sensitivity=62.9%, Specificity=63.9%), DRAT score of 3 (Sensitivity=31.4%, Specificity=81.0%), and DEAR score of 2 (Sensitivity=40.0%, Specificity=82.9%) maximized the Youden's Index value. Patients above these thresholds were 6.0, 2.0, and 3.2 times more likely to develop POD after posterior lumbar fusion, respectively. Delirium risk assessments tools were found to be useful in stratifying patients at high risk of POD following posterior lumbar fusion. Specifically, patients above the pre-defined thresholds were 2 to 6 times more likely to develop delirium postoperatively. Careful stratification of patients' risk of delirium using highly sensitive and specific tools like DRAS may guide preoperative surgical planning and postoperative management plans.

226,"39882618","Validation of a Novel MRI Biomarker of Infarct Severity to Predict Functional Outcome After Endovascular Thrombectomy.","Background: Endovascular thrombectomy (EVT) dramatically improves clinical outcomes, but the final infarct volume (FIV) on MRI only accounts for a minority of the treatment effect. An imaging biomarker that more strongly correlates with post-EVT functional outcome would be helpful for clinical prognosis and serve as a surrogate outcome measure in trials of EVT-adjuvant therapies. Here, we aimed to validate a novel MRI-based metric, infarct density, which leverages post-EVT apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) as a marker of infarct severity. Methods:A retrospective cohort was derived from a single-center prospective EVT registry. Consecutive anterior circulation EVT patients were included from 2018-2019 who achieved successful reperfusion (mTICI ≥2b). MRI was performed 12-48 hours post-EVT and processed via RAPID to quantify FIV using the ADC <620 threshold. Lesion volume was also collected using ADC <470 threshold, and infarct density was calculated as: (volume <470/volume <620)x100%. Good outcome was defined as ≤2 on the 90-day modified Rankin Scale. Multivariable logistic regression models quantified the association between clinical/imaging variables and outcome. ROC analysis quantified model classification performance. Results: Of 319 EVT patients, 272 met inclusion criteria. The mean age was 69 ±13 years, 41% were female, and 62% achieved a good outcome. After adjusting for clinical and radiographic factors, FIV (aOR 0.99 per 1mL; 95%CI: 0.98-1.00; p=0.03) and infarct density (aOR 0.95 per 1%; 95%CI: 0.94-0.97; p<0.001) were both independently inversely associated with good outcome. The final model incorporating both FIV and infarct density achieved excellent classification performance (AUC 0.87; 95%CI: 0.83-0.91). Removing infarct density from the model diminished its performance (AUC 0.83; 95%CI: 0.78-0.88; p=0.01). Conclusion: ADC-based infarct density after EVT is independently associated with long-term outcome and provides greater prognostic information than FIV alone. Post-EVT infarct density may be useful in clinical care and as a surrogate outcome measure in trials of EVT-adjuvant therapies.","2025","Stroke"

We aimed to investigate whether the addition of AF polygenic risk scores (PRS) to existing clinical risk predictors could improve prediction of AF after stroke. Methods: Patients diagnosed with ischemic stroke at Massachusetts General Hospital between 2003-2017 were included. Clinical AF risk was estimated using the Re-CHARGE-AF model and genetic risk was estimated using a contemporary AF PRS from 1,093,050 variants. Patients were divided into clinical and genetic risk tertiles. Cox proportional hazards models at different follow-up windows were fit, and C-indices and percentile-based Net Reclassification Index (NRI) were used to determine improvement of clinical risk models with the addition of AF PRS. Results: Of 1004 stroke survivors, 900 (90%) were non-Hispanic White, 413 (41%) were female, and the mean age was 67 (SD 14). Of 1004 survivors, 239 (23.8%) had prevalent AF and 87/765 (11.4%) of the remaining patients developed incident AF during 5 years of follow-up. AF PRS was associated with greater risk of incident AF after stroke (HR 1.16 [95% Confidence Interval (CI) 0.94-1.44] per 1 SD increase), although the association was not statistically significant. PRS improved discrimination in the first month (AUC 0.78 [95% CI 0.70-0.82] vs AUC 0.71 [95% CI 0.60-0.82], p = 0.05), with more modest estimates across longer time windows. Conclusion: Addition of an AF PRS to clinical risk models may improve identification of individuals at risk of AF after stroke, particularly within the first month.","2025","Stroke"

We conducted a prospective, single-center, observational study of adult patients with suspected stroke admitted in the emergency department. Flow wave profiles of both CCAs were generated by non-specialists using POCUS as soon as possible after admission. ac-LVO was defined as an internal carotid artery or M1 occlusion in CT- or MR-angiography. The diagnostic performances for detection of ac-LVO using flow wave parameters were calculated. Among 283 patients recruited during a 10-month period, 257 patients (91%) had CCA ultrasound images of sufficient quality and were included for analysis. The mean age was 75 years (IQR 62-83), 131 were female (51.0%), median baseline NIHSS was 2 (IQR 0-5). The most frequent final diagnosis was ischemic stroke (49.4%), ac-LVO was present in 30 patients (11.9%). The median duration of POCUS was 3 min (IQR 2-5). Among all flow wave parameters, the highest diagnostic accuracy for ac-LVO detection was found for end-diastolic velocity difference between sides (AUC = 0.90, 95%CI = 0.85-0.93), with a specificity of 83% (95%CI = 78-88%) at a predefined sensitivity threshold of 80%. POCUS of the CCA in patients with suspected stroke can predict the presence of ac-LVO. These results need to be replicated in a prehospital setting.","2025","European stroke journal"

Multivariate regression analyses and subgroup analyses were performed, controlling for socio-demographic variables, lifestyle behaviors, chronic diseases associated with kidney disease, and biochemical markers of bone metabolism. The associations between CLR and CKD prevalence, as well as indicators of renal damage, were explored. Non-linear relationships were analyzed using weighted restricted cubic splines. The predictive ability of CLR for CKD was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic curve and the area under the curve was calculated. Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted to validate the robustness of the model. A total of 13,862 respondents were included, comprising 2,449 CKD patients and 11,413 non-CKD patients. Weighted logistic regression modeling revealed a positive correlation between CLR levels and CKD prevalence (Odds ratio [OR] = 1.54, 95% Confidence interval [CI] = 1.30 to 1.83, P < 0.001). Additionally, CLR levels were negatively correlated with the glomerular filtration rate, a marker of renal injury, and positively correlated with the urinary albumin/creatinine ratio. The receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrated that the area under the curve for CLR in predicting CKD was 0.653 (95% CI, 0.641-0.665). The optimal cutoff value was 0.856, with a sensitivity of 0.703, specificity of 0.526, positive predictive value of 0.874, and negative predictive value of 0.275. The robustness of the model was confirmed through subgroup and sensitivity analyses. Analysis of a large cross-sectional dataset demonstrated a positive correlation between CLR levels and CKD prevalence, suggesting that CLR may serve as a novel marker for the development and treatment of CKD.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

A total of 122 patients with pathologically confirmed benign (n=47) or malignant (n=75) solid-containing renal masses were enrolled in this study. Radiomic features were extracted from the arterial, venous and delayed phases and further analysed by dimensionality reduction and selection. Four mainstream machine learning algorithm training models, namely, support vector machine (SVM), k-nearest neighbour (kNN), light gradient boosting (LightGBM) and logistic regression (LR), were constructed to determine the best classifier model. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to determine the best clinical characteristics for constructing a clinical model. The radiomic and clinical signatures were integrated to construct a combined radiomic nomogram model. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to evaluate the performance of the radiomic nomogram, radiomic signature, and clinical model. Thirteen radiomic features were selected for the development of the radiomic signature. Among the various radiomic models, the LR model demonstrated superior predictive efficiency and robustness, yielding an AUC of 0.952 in the training cohort and 0.887 in the test cohort. The AUC for the clinical model was 0.854 in the training cohort and 0.747 in the test cohort. Furthermore, the radiomic nomogram, which incorporated sex, age, alcohol consumption history, and the radiomic signature, exhibited excellent discriminative performance, yielding an AUC of 0.973 in the training cohort and 0.900 in the test cohort.

Reduced expression of the MGMT gene (10q26.3), influenced primarily by the methylation of two differentially methylated regions (DMR1 and DMR2), is associated with a good response to temozolomide treatment. However, suitable methods for detecting the methylation of the MGMT gene promoter and setting appropriate cutoff values are debated. A cohort of 108 patients with histologically and genetically defined glioblastoma was retrospectively examined with methylation-specific Sanger sequencing (sSeq) and methylation-specific multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MS-MLPA) methods. The DMR2 region was methylated in 29% of samples, whereas DMR1 was methylated in 12% of samples. Methylation detected with the MS-MLPA method using probes MGMT_215, MGMT_190, and MGMT_124 from the ME012-A1 kit (located in DMR1 and DMR2) correlated with the methylation of the corresponding CpG dinucleotides detected with sSeq (p = 0.005 for probe MGMT_215; p < 0.001 for probe MGMT_190; p = 0.016 for probe MGMT_124). The threshold for methylation detection with the MS-MLPA method was calculated with a ROC curve analysis and principal components analysis of the data obtained with the MS-MLPA and sSeq methods, yielding a weighted value of 0.362. Thus, methylation of the MGMT gene promoter was confirmed in 36% of samples. These patients had statistically significantly better overall survival (p = 0.003). Our results show that the threshold for methylation detection with the MS-MLPA method determined here is useful from a diagnostic perspective because it allows the stratification of patients who will benefit from specific treatment protocols, including temozolomide.

Radiomics, deep transfer learning (DTL), and fusion models based on CE-MRI were established for differential diagnosis, respectively, and their diagnostic performances were compared using the confusion matrix and area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). The radiomics model demonstrated competent diagnostic performance, with a macro-AUC exceeding 0.9, and both accuracy and F1-score above 0.75 in the internal and external validation sets. Notably, the vgg19-combined model outperformed the radiomics and other DTL models. The fusion model based on vgg19 further improved diagnostic performance, achieving a macro-AUC of 0.990 (95% CI: 0.965-1.000), an accuracy of 0.935, and an F1-score of 0.937 in the internal test set. In the external test set, it similarly performed well, with a macro-AUC of 0.988 (95% CI: 0.964-1.000), accuracy of 0.875, and an F1-score of 0.885. Both the radiomics and the DTL models were able to differentiate DPHCC from HCC and ICC before surgery. The fusion models showed better diagnostic accuracy, which has important value in clinical application. MRI-based deep learning radiomics were able to differentiate DPHCC from HCC and ICC preoperatively, aiding clinicians in the identification and targeted treatment of these malignant hepatic tumors. Fusion models may yield an incremental value over radiomics models in differential diagnosis. Radiomics and deep learning effectively differentiate the three types of malignant hepatic tumors.

Patients with clinical evidence of apical periodontitis were included retrospectively and received OPT as well as MRI of the viscerocranium including a 3D-STIR and a 3D-T1 gradient echo sequence. Bone edema was visualized using the 3D-STIR sequence and periapical hard tissue changes were evaluated using the 3D-T1 sequence. Lesions were segmented and volumes were calculated for bone edema and structural decay. OPTs were assessed for corresponding periapical radiolucencies using the periapical index (PAI). Of the 42 patients of the initial cohort 21 patients with 38 periapical lesions were included in the analysis (mean age 57.2 ± 13.8 years, 9 women). Reactive bone edema was detected on MRI in 23 periapical lesions with corresponding radiolucency on OPT. Fifteen periapical lesions were detected only in the STIR sequence. The volume of edema measured in the STIR was significantly larger in OPT-positive lesions (mean: STIR (OPT+) 207.3 ± 191.1 mm³) compared to OPT-negative lesions (mean: STIR (OPT-) 29.5 ± 34.2 mm³, p < 0.001). The ROC curve analysis demonstrated that Volume T1 (0.905, p < 0.01) and Volume STIR (0.857, p < 0.01) measurements have strong diagnostic performance for distinguishing OPT-positive from OPT-negative lesions. Clinically symptom-free patients without pathologic changes in OPT can show signs of inflammation within the periapical bone. Bone edema volume visualized by STIR sequence exceeds bone architecture changes indicated in T1-based imaging and might precede osteolysis in dental radiography. These results show that subtle intraosseous inflammation within the periapical tissue might remain undetected by conventional dental radiography and T1-based sequences. This emphasizes the potential of MRI in secondary prevention in dentistry. Conventional panoramic radiography (OPT) may show only delayed findings of pathological periapical changes. MRI detected bone edema in 23 radiolucent lesions on OPT. MRI revealed 15 lesions only visible with STIR sequences.

We aim to develop deep learning models for re-stratify risks in PI-RADS category 3 patients. This retrospective study included a bi-parametric MRI of 1567 consecutive male patients from six centers (Centers 1-6) between Jan 2015 and Dec 2020. Deep learning models with double channel attention modules based on MRI (AttenNet) for predicting PCa and csPCa were constructed separately. Each model was first pretrained using 1144 PI-RADS 1-2 and 4-5 images and then retrained using 238 PI-RADS 3 images from three training centers (centers 1-3), and tested using 185 PI-RADS 3 images from the other three testing centers (centers 4-6). Our AttenNet models achieved excellent prediction performances in testing cohort of center 4-6 with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.795 (95% CI: [0.700, 0.891]), 0.963 (95% CI: [0.915, 1]) and 0.922 (95% CI: [0.810, 1]) in predicting PCa, and the corresponding AUCs were 0.827 (95% CI: [0.703, 0.952]) and 0.926 (95% CI: [0.846, 1]) in predicting csPCa in testing cohort of center 4 and center 5. In particular, 71.1% to 92.2% of non-csPCa patients were identified by our model in three testing cohorts, who can spare from invasive biopsy or RP procedure. Our model offers a noninvasive screening clinical tool to re-stratify risks in PI-RADS 3 patients, thereby reducing unnecessary invasive biopsies and improving the effectiveness of biopsies. The deep learning model with MRI can help to screen out csPCa in PI-RADS category 3. AttenNet models included channel attention and soft attention modules. 71.1-92.2% of non-csPCa patients were identified by the AttenNet model. The AttenNet models can be a screen clinical tool to re-stratify risks in PI-RADS 3 patients.","2025","Insights into imaging"

This retrospective study included 850 patients with indeterminate adnexal masses on ultrasound. Two radiologists evaluated all preoperative MRIs using the O-RADS MRI risk stratification system. Patients with O-RADS MRI scores of 4-5 were divided into a training set (n = 135, hospital A) and a test set (n = 86, hospital B). Clinical and MRI features were compared between CCC and non-CCC patients. Analysis of variance and support vector machine were used to develop four CCC prediction models. Tenfold cross-validation was applied to determine the hyperparameters. Model performance was evaluated by the area under the curve (AUC) and decision curve. 221 patients were included (30 CCCs, 191 non-CCCs). CA125, HE4, CEA, ROMA, endometriosis, shape, parity, unilocular, component, the growth pattern of mural nodules, high signal on T1WI, number of nodules, the ratio of signal intensity, and the ADC value were significantly different between CCCs and non-CCCs. The kappa and interobserver correlation coefficient of each MRI feature exceeded 0.85. The comprehensive model combining clinical and MRI features had a greater AUC than the clinical model and tumour maker model (0.92 vs 0.66 and 0.78 in the test set; both p < 0.05), displaying improved net benefit. The comprehensive model combining clinical and MRI features can effectively differentiate CCC from adnexal masses with O-RADS MRI scores of 4-5. CCC has a high incidence rate in Asians and has limited sensitivity to platinum chemotherapy. This comprehensive model improves CCC prediction ability and clinical applicability for facilitating individualised clinical decision-making. Identifying ovarian CCC preoperatively is beneficial for treatment planning. Ovarian CCC tends to be high-signal on T1WI, unilocular, big size, with endometriosis and low CEA. This model, integrating clinical and MRI features, can differentiate ovarian CCC from adnexal masses with O-RADS MRI scores 4-5.","2025","Insights into imaging"

This multicentre retrospective study included patients with PTC between October 2017 and June 2024 across seven institutions. Patients were categorised based on the presence or absence of large-number CLNM in training, validation, and external testing cohorts. A clinical model was developed based on the maximum diameter of thyroid nodules. Radiomics features were extracted from US images and pathomics features were extracted from FNAC images. Feature selection was performed using univariate analysis, correlation analysis, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression. Six machine learning (ML) algorithms were employed to construct radiomics, pathomics, and radiopathomics models. Predictive performance was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC), and decision curve analysis (DCA). A total of 426 patients with PTC (41.65 ± 12.47 years; 124 men) were included in this study, with 213 (50%) exhibiting large-number CLNM. The multimodal radiopathomics model demonstrated excellent predictive capabilities with AUCs 0.921, 0.873, 0.903; accuracies (ACCs) 0.852, 0.800, 0.833; sensitivities (SENs) 0.876, 0.867, 0.857; specificities (SPEs) 0.829, 0.733, 0.810, for the training, validation, and testing cohorts, respectively.

The multimodal radiopathomics model demonstrated significant advantages in the preoperative prediction of large-number CLNM in patients with cN0 PTC. Question Accurate preoperative prediction of large-number CLNM in PTC patients can guide treatment plans, but single-modality diagnostic performance remains limited. Findings The radiopathomics model utilising preoperative US and FNAC images effectively predicted large-number CLNM in both validation and testing cohorts, outperforming single predictive models.

In this retrospective study, patients with IA from November 2015 to March 2024 were recruited from two independent centers (center 1, training and internal test data set; center 2, external test data set). TLS was divided into two groups according to hematoxylin-eosin staining. Radiomic features were extracted, and support vector machine (SVM) were implemented to predict the status of TLSs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze diagnostic performance. Furthermore, visual assessments of the test set were also conducted by two thoracic radiologists and compared with the radiomics results. A total of 456 patients were included (training data set, n = 278; internal test data set, n = 115; external test data set, n = 63). The area under the curve (AUC) of the radiomics model on the validation set, the internal test set, and the external test set were 0.781 (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.659-0.905;), 0.804 (95% CI: 0.723-0.884;) and 0.747 (95% CI: 0.621-0.874;), respectively. In the visual assessments, the mean CT value and air bronchogram were important indicators of TLS, the AUC was 0.683. In the external test set, the AUC of the clinical model was 0.632. The radiomics model has a higher AUC than the clinical model and effectively discriminates TLSs in patients with IA. This study demonstrates that the radiomics-based model can differentiate TLSs in patients with IA. As a non-invasive biomarker, it enhances our understanding of tumor prognosis and management. TLSs are closely related to favorable clinical outcomes in non-small cell lung cancer. Radiomics from Chest CT predicted TLSs in patients with IA.

A total of 604 patients suspected of having gouty arthritis were enrolled and randomly divided into a training set (n = 483) and a validation set (n = 121) in a 4:1 ratio. Univariate and multivariate analyses were conducted on the clinical data to identify statistically significant clinical features for constructing an initial diagnostic model. Key radiomic features were identified in the training set using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis to establish a radiomic model. A composite clinicoradiomic nomogram was then developed by combining clinical (such as C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and uric acid level) and radiomic features through logistic regression. The predictive performance of the clinical model, radiomic model and clinicoradiomic nomogram was evaluated in the validation set using receiver operating characteristic curves, calibration curves and decision curve analysis. The clinicoradiomic nomogram, which integrated imaging features and clinical characteristics via logistic regression, demonstrated superior predictive performance in the validation set, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.936 (95% CI: 0.885-0.986), surpassing both clinical (AUC = 0.924; 95% CI: 0.873-0.976) and radiomic models (AUC = 0.828; 95% CI: 0.738-0.918) alone. Decision curve analysis further confirmed the clinical utility of this model, particularly in differentiating between gouty and non-gouty arthritis. Compared with standalone clinical or radiomic models, the ultrasonography-based clinicoradiomic model exhibited enhanced predictive accuracy for diagnosing gouty arthritis, presenting a novel and promising approach for the early diagnosis and management of gouty arthritis.","2025","Ultrasound in medicine & biology"

The primary outcome was three-year mortality. The following 5 machine learning approaches were used for modeling: Random Forest (RF), Gradient Boosting, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Support Vector Machine, and Multilayer perceptron. We compared the performance of the best performing ML models to the MAGGIC (Meta-analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure) score and a novel logistic regression model (LRM) developed using the same set of variables used to develop the machine learning models. The performance was determined based on discrimination, calibration, and net benefit. The XGBoost and the RF were the best performing ML models. The XGBoost provided the highest discrimination (C-statistic: 0.793) and the lowest Brier score (0.178); the RF model had a C-statistic of 0.779 and provided the highest area under the precision-recall curve (0.636). Both models were well calibrated. Both the XGboost and RF models outperformed MAGGIC score. The LRM had a C-statistic of 0.811 and a Brier score of 0.160 and was well calibrated. The XGBoost, RF, and LRM gave a higher net benefit than MAGGIC score; the XGBoost, RF, and logistic regression model gave similar net benefit. RF and XGBoost models outperformed MAGGIC in predicting mortality. However, they did not offer any improvement over a logistic regression model built using the same set of covariates considered in the ML modeling.","2025","European journal of internal medicine"

The homeostasis model assessment of β-cell function (HOMA-β) measures pancreatic β-cell function. This study investigated the association between HOMA-β and adverse cardiovascular events in non-diabetic CVD patients. This study included 1301 non-diabetic CVD patients who underwent cardiac catheterization at the University of Yamanashi Hospital. HOMA-β was calculated based on fasting blood glucose and insulin levels. Patients were followed for 3 years to track adverse events, such as all-cause death, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris requiring percutaneous coronary intervention, and heart failure. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis established a HOMA-β cut-off value of ≤49.3%. Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with HOMA-β ≤49.3% had a significantly higher risk of adverse events (P <0.001), with a 2.65-fold increased risk (hazard ratio 2.65; 95% confidence interval 1.97-3.57). Adding HOMA-β to traditional risk factors such as age, sex, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and left ventricular ejection fraction significantly improved risk prediction, as demonstrated by net reclassification improvement and integrated discrimination improvement. Decreased HOMA-β is a significant predictor of adverse cardiovascular events in CVD patients without diabetes. These findings suggest reduced insulin secretion contributes to worse outcomes, underscoring the importance of monitoring HOMA-β in this population.","2025","Circulation journal : official journal of the Japanese Circulation Society"

The underlying causes of functional impairment are poorly understood and, therefore, we sought to investigate the contribution of genetic factors. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of sociodemographic, clinical and genetic information of people with COPD. Hierarchical clustering based on functional capacity (6-minute walk test and 1-minute sit-to-stand test) and muscle strength (quadriceps isometric muscle strength and handgrip muscle strength) was performed. A genome-wide association study (GWAS) was performed using cluster assignment as phenotype. Polygenic risk scores (PRSs) were calculated for each variable. Genomic-derived data was used to construct a model to predict functional impairment. Two clusters were identified among 245 individuals. Cluster 1 (n=104) was composed of younger, less symptomatic patients, with preserved functional capacity and muscle strength, whereas cluster 2 (n=141) included those older, more symptomatic, with reduced functional capacity and muscle weakness. GWAS identified two polymorphisms suggestively associated with functional impairment, mapped to xanthine dehydrogenase. Cluster 2 was enriched in individuals with risk alleles for rs1991541 and rs10524730, and lower PRSs for functional capacity and muscle strength. A prediction model using genomic-derived data was constructed (n=159) and tested (n=37), yielding an area under the curve of 0.87 (0.76-0.99). Genetic factors are significantly associated with functional impairment in COPD. The incorporation of genetic information, particularly PRSs, into a predictive model offers a promising avenue for timely identifying individuals at greater risk of functional decline, potentially facilitating personalised and preventive interventions. Further studies on independent external cohorts are needed to validate our model.","2025","Thorax"

We enrolled 108 HFS patients (63 severe and 45 mild cases) and implemented a human-in-the-loop approach to develop a quantitative NVC feature package. This process involved using interactive segmentation on three-dimensional volumetric interpolated breath-hold examination (VIBE) MR images to delineate vascular and nerve structures. From these segmentations, we extracted quantitative NVC features, forming an NVC feature package, and applied a support vector machine model to assess HFS severity. Our interactive segmentation technique achieved high accuracy (Dice similarity coefficients of 0.905 ± 0.030 for vascular structures and 0.922 ± 0.086 for nerves). The NVC feature package, comprising distance between vascular structures and nerves, vascular diameter, their ratio, and clinical characteristics, enabled our model to assess HFS severity with an AUC of 0.823 (95% CI: 0.714-0.932, p < 0.001). This study introduced a quantitative approach to understanding the relationship between HFS severity and NVC, using VIBE MR imaging. Our model offers a promising tool for enhancing clinical decision-making and offers deeper insights into the impact of NVCon HFS, aiming to improve patient outcomes. Microvascular decompression is well-established as a safe and effective treatment for HFS.

Our goal was to compare practice patterns before and after publication of the AUC to identify changes. The Vascular Quality Initiative (VQI) peripheral vascular intervention (PVI), and suprainguinal, and infrainguinal bypass registries were analyzed for interventions for IC. Relevant patient and intervention characteristics pre-AUC (2018-2019) and post-AUC (May 2022-December 2023) were compared. Key points of the AUC that are analyzable from the VQI include claudication severity, use of optimal medical therapy (OMT), smoking status, high-risk comorbid conditions (as indicators of operative risk), operative management of complex aortoiliac and femoropopliteal disease (TASC II C/D), common femoral artery (CFA) PVIs, and infrapopliteal procedures. There were 15,892 PVI, 2352 suprainguinal bypass, and 3480 infrainguinal bypass procedures analyzed. Changes consistent with the appropriateness ratings for PVI included more interventions for severe symptoms (72% vs 66.6%, P<.001), improvement in post-operative OMT (83% vs 79.7%, P<.001), fewer patients on dialysis undergoing PVI (2% vs 2.7%, P<.002), and less interventions on complex (TASC II C/D) aortoiliac (6.3% vs 9.5%, P<.001) and femoropopliteal (4.5% vs 5.8%, P <.001) anatomy. No changes were seen in the rates of pre-operative smoking and pre-operative OMT use, interventions on octogenarians, or in the use of extra-anatomic suprainguinal bypass, infrapopliteal bypass, or prosthetic conduit. Inconsistent with appropriateness ratings were more patients with congestive heart failure (15.1% vs 12.8%, P<.001) undergoing PVIs, and more PVIs for CFA (5.2% vs 3.4%, P<.001) and isolated infrapopliteal disease (5.7% vs 3.5%, P<.001). Since the publication of the AUC, there have been improvements with better OMT on discharge, fewer patients with ESRD undergoing interventions, and less endovascular treatment of complex disease. However, further work is needed to improve pre-operative medical optimization in patients with IC undergoing an invasive intervention and decrease the use of endovascular interventions for CFA and infrapopliteal disease, extra-anatomic aortoiliac revascularizations, and prosthetic conduit use.","2025","Journal of vascular surgery"

XBP has been utilized for the treatment of chronic heart failure (CHF) for nearly 30 years, but the lack of clarity regarding the active ingredients of XBP against CHF has hindered its clinical application and further promotion. To comprehensively elucidate the efficacy-specific ingredients and potential mechanism of XBP against CHF. The efficacy, chemical profiling and pharmacokinetics of XBP was assessed in a CHF model rat. The anti-CHF mechanism of the mixture of the likely active ingredients was clarified by targeted metabolomics and western blotting analysis. XBP alleviated CHF by enhancing cardiac function, reducing NT-pro BNP, mitigating myocardial damage and degrading extracellular collagen. Following XBP administration, ginsenosides exposed relatively abundant in sham or CHF rats. Ginsenoside Rg1 and notoginsenoside R1 showed downward trends in AUC0-t values in CHF group, accompanied by increasing trends in CL/F values. Moreover, CHF rats presented significantly elevated levels of ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rg2 and notoginsenoside R1 in heart. The mixture of ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rg2 and notoginsenoside R1 demonstrated remarkable efficacy in ameliorating CHF as XBP did. Notably, these three compounds were predominantly localized in mitochondria and exhibited significant potential to enhance mitochondrial homeostasis by inhibiting heme synthesis pathway-mediated decomposition of succinyl CoA. Our research provides valuable insights that ginsenoside Rg1, ginsenoside Rg2 and notoginsenoside R1 may constitute the anti-CHF active ingredients of XBP for facilitating mitochondrial homeostasis by the suppression of heme synthesis to increase succinyl CoA.","2025","Journal of ethnopharmacology"

This study develops a multimodal deep learning model integrating electrocardiogram (ECG) signals and laboratory indicators to enhance diagnostic accuracy for AAD-type A and AMI. We gathered ECG and laboratory data from 136 AAD-type A and 141 AMI patients at Zigong Fourth People's Hospital (January 2019 to December 2023) for training and validation. Utilizing ResNet-34 (residual network), we extracted ECG features and combined them with laboratory and demographic data.

Data from 30 AMI and 32 AAD-type A patients (January to September 2024) were used as a prospective test set. Incorporating ECG features significantly improved model's AUC value, with the RandomForest achieving the best performance (AUC 0.98 on validation, 0.969 on test). SHAP analysis revealed that troponin and D-dimer, along with the embedding features of ECG extracted by the deep neural network, are key characteristics for differentiating AAD-type A and AMI.

Plasma p-tau biomarkers are believed to reflect tau phosphorylation and secretion. However, it remains unclear to what extent the magnitude of plasma p-tau abnormalities reflects neuronal network disturbance in the form of cognitive impairment. To address this question, we included 103 cognitively unimpaired elderly and 40 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β positive individuals from the TRIAD cohort, as well as 336 cognitively unimpaired and 216 cognitively impaired, amyloid-β positive older adults from the BioFINDER-2 cohort. Participants had tau PET scans, amyloid PET scans or amyloid CSF, p-tau217, p-tau181 and p-tau231 blood measures, structural T1-MRI and cognitive assessments. In this cross-sectional study, we used regression models and correlation analyses to assess the relationship between plasma biomarkers and cognitive scores. Furthermore, we applied receiver operating characteristic curves to assess cognitive impairment across plasma biomarkers. Finally, we categorized participants into amyloid (A), p-tau (T1), and tau PET (T2) positive (+) or negative (-) profiles and ran nonparametric comparisons to assess differences across cognitive domains. We found that plasma p-tau217 was more associated with cognitive performance than p-tau181 and p-tau231, and that this relationship was particularly strong for memory scores (TRIAD: βp-tau217=-0.53; βp-tau181=-0.35; βp-tau231=-0.24; BioFINDER-2: βp-tau217=-0.52; βp-tau181=-0.24; βp-tau231=-0.29). Associations in amyloid-β positive participants resembled these results, but other cognitive scores also showed strong associations in cognitively impaired individuals. Moreover, plasma p-tau217 outperformed plasma p-tau181 and plasma p-tau231 in identifying memory impairment (Area Under the Curve values for TRIAD: p-tau217=0.86, p-tau181=0.77, p-tau231=0.75; Area Under the Curve values for BioFINDER-2: p-tau217=0.86, p-tau181=0.76, p-tau231=0.81), and in identifying executive function impairment only in the BioFINDER-2 cohort (p-tau217=0.82, p-tau181=0.76, p-tau231=0.76). Lastly, we showed that subtle memory deficits were present in A+T1+T2- participants for plasma p-tau217 (p=0.007) and plasma p-tau181 (p=0.01) in the TRIAD cohort, and for all biomarkers across cognitive domains in A+T1-T2- and A+T1+T2- individuals (p<0.001 in all) in the BioFINDER-2 cohort. A+T1+T2+ individuals showed cognitive deficits in both cohorts (p<0.001 in all). Together, our results suggest that plasma p-tau217 stands out as a biomarker capable of identifying memory deficits due to Alzheimer's disease and that memory impairment certainly occurs in amyloid and plasma p-tau positive individuals that have no significant amounts of tau in the neocortex.","2025","Brain : a journal of neurology"

The aim of this study was to develop an MRI protocol that can be performed without sedation or contrast in order to identify infants who would benefit from surgery at an earlier age than the age at which that decision could be made clinically. This prospective multicenter NAPTIME (Non-Anesthetized Plexus Technique for Infant MRI Evaluation) study included infants aged 28 to 120 days with BPBI from 3 tertiary care centers. Subjects had nonsedated non-contrast rapid volumetric proton density MRI on 3-T scanners. Neuroradiologists at each site calculated the NAPTIME nerve root injury score for subjects at their site. Interrater reliability was performed on a subset of subjects. All of the subjects were evaluated with routine clinical examinations up to 6 months of age, by which time the treating surgeon determined whether to offer nerve surgery. Surgeons were blinded to the MRI results. The ability of the NAPTIME score to discriminate surgeon indication for surgery was evaluated using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, by estimating the area under the curve (AUC) across the range of NAPTIME scores. Sixty-five infants successfully completed the NAPTIME MRI; 18 (28%) ultimately met the clinical criteria for nerve surgery. The interrater reliability for the NAPTIME score was moderate at 0.703 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.582 to 0.818). The median NAPTIME score for subjects who met the criteria for nerve surgery was 16.2 (interquartile range [IQR], 9.9 to 18.9), while the median score for those who did not was 7.0 (IQR, 5.0 to10.5). The NAPTIME score predicted meeting the criteria for surgery with an AUC of 0.812 (95% CI, 0.688 to 0.936). A score of >13 offered a specificity of 0.94 and a sensitivity of 0.61 for surgical indication. Non-contrast MRI without sedation is a useful tool in determining the severity of injury in BPBI. The NAPTIME score might distinguish which infants will meet the criteria for reconstructive nerve surgery earlier than when the decision can be made clinically. Prognostic Level II.

However, the performance of generic PAH risk stratification tools in patients with systemic sclerosis (SSc)-associated PAH remains unclear. Our objective was to identify the most accurate approach for risk stratification at SSc-PAH diagnosis. In this multicentre, international cohort study from the European Scleroderma Trials and Research (EUSTAR) group database, we screened eleven risk stratification tools upon SSc-PAH diagnosis. We compared the performance of the three top-ranked tools to predict mortality with the ESC/ERS three-strata model, the currently recommended tool for baseline risk assessment. We also assessed the impact of incorporating SSc-specific characteristics into the tools. Kaplan-Meier analyses and Cox regression with area under the ROC curve (AUC) were conducted. The ESC/ERS three-strata model had a lower ability to predict mortality than the ESC/ERS four-strata model, ""SPAHR updated"", and ""REVEAL Lite 2"". The ESC/ERS four-strata model divided ""intermediate-risk"" patients into two groups with significantly different long-term survival rates and is the easiest applicable tool. Incorporating SSc-specific characteristics did not significantly improve the predictive ability of any model, but a low DLCO was an independent predictor of mortality. Considering its ability to predict mortality, risk segregation capabilities, and clinical applicability, this study provides a rationale for using the simplified ESC/ERS four-strata model at SSc-PAH diagnosis as an alternative to the comprehensive ESC/ERS three-strata model. We propose considering DLCO as an individual prognostic marker in SSc-PAH.","2025","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)"

We performed a systematic literature search of online scientific publication databases from inception up to July 31, 2024. We used the quality assessment of diagnostic accuracy studies-2 (QUADAS-2) to assess the study quality, and heterogeneity was determined by the Q-test and measured with I2 statistics. We employed the hierarchic summary ROC (HSROC) model to estimate the summary sensitivity and specificity. Subgroup analyses were conducted according to the imaging modality and cutoff values. A total of 13 studies involving 1341 participants met the inclusion criteria. Pooled summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve of HSROC were 0.79 (95% CI: 0.66-0.88), 0.86 (95% CI: 0.80-0.90), and 0.90 (95% CI: 0.87-0.92). Subgroup analysis showed that the pooled sensitivity and specificity for CT were 0.74 (95% CI: 0.63-0.83) and 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74-0.91), whereas for MRI were 0.84 (95% CI: 0.59-0.95) and 0.88 (95% CI: 0.81-0.93), respectively. Node-RADS demonstrates the promising potential for the prediction of LN invasion, with high specificity but moderate sensitivity, particularly with optimal cutoff value ≥ 3. Indirect comparisons showed no significant difference between CT and MRI regarding overall diagnostic accuracy. Question Since the Node-RADS has been proposed, a number of studies have assessed its diagnostic performance for evaluating LN invasion.

This study investigated a generative artificial intelligence (AI) approach to create synthetic medical images taking the example of bone scintigraphy scans, to increase the data diversity of small-scale datasets for more effective model training and improved generalization. We trained a generative model on 99mTc-bone scintigraphy scans from 9,170 patients in one center to generate high-quality and fully anonymized annotated scans of patients representing two distinct disease patterns: abnormal uptake indicative of (i) bone metastases and (ii) cardiac uptake indicative of cardiac amyloidosis. A blinded reader study was performed to assess the clinical validity and quality of the generated data. We investigated the added value of the generated data by augmenting an independent small single-center dataset with synthetic data and by training a deep learning model to detect abnormal uptake in a downstream classification task. We tested this model on 7,472 scans from 6,448 patients across four external sites in a cross-tracer and cross-scanner setting and associated the resulting model predictions with clinical outcomes. The clinical value and high quality of the synthetic imaging data were confirmed by four readers, who were unable to distinguish synthetic scans from real scans (average accuracy: 0.48% [95% CI 0.46-0.51]), disagreeing in 239 (60%) of 400 cases (Fleiss' kappa: 0.18). Adding synthetic data to the training set improved model performance by a mean (± SD) of 33(± 10)% AUC (p < 0.0001) for detecting abnormal uptake indicative of bone metastases and by 5(± 4)% AUC (p < 0.0001) for detecting uptake indicative of cardiac amyloidosis across both internal and external testing cohorts, compared to models without synthetic training data. Patients with predicted abnormal uptake had adverse clinical outcomes (log-rank: p < 0.0001). Generative AI enables the targeted generation of bone scintigraphy images representing different clinical conditions. Our findings point to the potential of synthetic data to overcome challenges in data sharing and in developing reliable and prognostic deep learning models in data-limited environments.","2025","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging"
255,"39878853","Impact of impaired renal function on kinetics of high-sensitive cardiac troponin following cardiac surgery.","Impaired renal function can increase cardiac troponin levels due to reduced elimination, potentially affecting its diagnostic utility. Limited data exist on high-sensitivity cardiac troponin I (hs-cTnI) kinetics after cardiac surgery relative to renal function. This study evaluates how impaired renal function influences hs-cTnI kinetics following cardiac surgery, distinguishing between patients with and without postoperative myocardial infarction (PMI). We conducted a retrospective analysis of adult patients who underwent elective cardiac surgery at our hospital from January 2013 to May 2019. Serial hs-cTnI measurements were taken from baseline up to 48 h post-surgery. Renal function was assessed using the MDRD formula, defining impaired renal function as a GFR < 60 ml/min. Acute kidney injury (AKI) was based on postoperative creatinine levels, and PMI was defined by ARC-2 criteria. Predictors of long-term all-cause mortality were analyzed using Cox regression. Out of 14,355 patients (51.4% CABG, 39.4% valvular procedures, 9.2% thoracic aortic procedures), 139 (1.0%) had PMI. Hs-cTnI levels were higher in patients with impaired renal function across the cohort and in those without PMI. However, in patients with PMI, hs-cTnI levels did not vary significantly with renal function. Elevated hs-cTnI ≥ 213 times the upper limit of normal was a significant predictor of long-term mortality regardless of renal function (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.17-1.40, p < 0.001), but early postoperative hs-cTnI measures held poor discriminatory yield to predict PMI with an AUC of 0.55 (95% confidence intervals: 0.54-0.56). Renal function and acute kidney injury affect hs-cTnI kinetics post-surgery only in patients without PMI. Elevated hs-cTnI remains a strong predictor of long-term mortality, independent of renal function, but early postoperative detection of PMI requires additional metrics, including ECG, transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), and signs of hemodynamic instability.","2025","Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society"

Polymorphisms in the genes ESR1 (rs9340799 and rs3138774), ESR2 (rs1256049 and rs4986938), and PGR (rs1042838) were analyzed. Regarding genotype distribution, the GA/AA genotype frequency for rs4986938-ESR2 was higher in the thin endometrium group (80% in the study group vs. 50% in the control group; P = 0.002), as well as the GG genotype of PGR (8.6% in the study group vs. 0% in the control group; P = 0.002). No differences were observed for the remaining genotypes. In terms of clinical data, the pregnancy rate after euploid embryo transfer was lower in patients with the AA genotype for rs4986938-ESR2 (18.2% AA vs. 40.8% GA vs. 44.0% GG; P = 0.039). Finally, a predictive pregnancy model was developed using clinical data and ESR2 and PGR genotypes, with an area under the curve of 0.76, sensitivity of 64%, and specificity of 76%. The genetic variants rs4986938 in the ESR2 gene and rs1042838 in the PGR gene seem to correlate with idiopathic thin endometrium. In addition, the rs4986938 polymorphism in the ESR2 gene is associated with pregnancy rate.

Differentiating radionecrosis from tumor recurrence non-invasively remains a major clinical challenge, as conventional imaging techniques often necessitate surgical biopsy for accurate diagnosis. Machine learning and deep learning models have shown potential in distinguishing radionecrosis from tumor recurrence. However, their clinical adoption is hindered by a lack of explainability, limiting understanding and trust in their diagnostic decisions. To utilize a novel neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) model for discerning BM post-SRS radionecrosis from recurrence. This approach integrates image-deep features, genomic biomarkers, and non-image clinical parameters within a synthesized latent feature space. The trajectory of each data sample towards the diagnosis decision can be visualized within this feature space, offering a new angle on radiogenomic data analysis foundational for AI explainability. By hypothesizing that deep feature extraction can be modeled as a spatiotemporally continuous process, we designed a novel model based on heavy ball NODE (HBNODE) in which deep feature extraction was governed by a second-order ODE. This approach enabled tracking of deep neural network (DNN) behavior by solving the HBNODE and observing the stepwise derivative evolution. Consequently, the trajectory of each sample within the Image-Genomic-Clinical (I-G-C) space became traceable. A decision-making field (F) was reconstructed within the feature space, with its gradient vectors directing the data samples' trajectories and intensities showing the potential. The evolution of F reflected the cumulative feature contributions at intermediate states to the final diagnosis, enabling quantitative and dynamic comparisons of the relative contribution of each feature category over time. A velocity curve was designed to determine key intermediate states (locoregional ∇F = 0) that are most predictive. Subsequently, a non-parametric model aggregated the optimal solutions from these key states to predict outcomes. Our dataset included 90 BMs from 62 NSCLC patients, and 3-month post-SRS T1+c MR image features, seven NSCLC genomic features, and seven clinical features were analyzed. An 8:2 train/test assignment was employed, and five independent models were trained to ensure robustness. Performance was benchmarked in sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and ROCAUC, and results were compared against (1) a DNN using only image-based features, and (2) a combined ""I+G+C"" features without the HBNODE model. The temporal evolution of gradient vectors and potential fields in F suggested that clinical features contribute the most during the initial stages of the HBNODE implementation, followed by imagery features taking dominance in the latter ones, while genomic features contribute the least throughout the process. The HBNODE model successfully identified and assembled key intermediate states, exhibiting competitive performance with an ROCAUC of 0.88 ± 0.04, sensitivity of 0.79 ± 0.02, specificity of 0.86 ± 0.01, and accuracy of 0.84 ± 0.01, where the uncertainties represent standard deviations. For comparison, the image-only DNN model achieved an ROCAUC of 0.71 ± 0.05 and sensitivity of 0.66 ± 0.32 (p = 0.086), while the ""I+G+C"" model without HBNODE reported an ROCAUC of 0.81 ± 0.02 and sensitivity of 0.58 ± 0.11 (p = 0.091). The HBNODE model effectively identifies BM radionecrosis from recurrence, enhancing explainability within XAI frameworks. Its performance encourages further exploration in clinical settings and suggests potential applicability across various XAI domains.","2025","Medical physics"

Patients with advanced ovarian cancer treated in our institution who were eligible for interval debulking surgery were identified and included in the study. A retrospective image collection was operated, and CT scan evaluations were conducted by 2 independent radiologists to establish both scores (Fagotti index and Sugarbaker PCI). The workflow included a third radiologist who resolved discrepancies. The receiver operating characteristics curve followed by the Youden J statistic was calculated to determine cutoff points that best differentiated complete/optimal versus suboptimal cytoreduction. The Fagotti index and Sugarbaker PCI cutoffs' accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value were calculated and represented as 95% CIs. A total of 60 consecutive patients who had complete information in their charts with evaluable images and complete information about surgery were evaluated; of these, 35 had a complete/optimal interval debulking surgery. The receiver operating characteristic curve of the Fagotti index scoring system showed that a cutoff of ≥3 can identify 100% of inoperable patients. However, 29% of patients were falsely labeled as inoperable. A cutoff point of ≥5 avoids 88% of unnecessary laparotomies, reducing the rate of false inoperable designation from 29% to 17%. A Sugarbaker PCI of ≥8 predicts the risk of unnecessary laparotomies in 68%, with 26% falsely labeled as inoperable. The score of ≥7 is most effective in avoiding unnecessary surgeries (80%), but the chance of false positives increases from 26% to 32%. CT-based scoring systems used in the present work can help determine which patients with advanced ovarian cancer are suitable for interval debulking surgery with high precision. Future studies are needed to enhance accuracy, thereby amplifying the radiologists' competency in using a systematic CT-based scoring system.","2025","International journal of gynecological cancer : official journal of the International Gynecological Cancer Society"

A 10-year prospective cohort study was conducted with 448,303 UK Biobank participants eligible for SCORE2 calculation. Three approaches were employed: (1) threshold analysis to determine the optimal ApoB cutoff for cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk prediction using Youden's Index, (2) assessment of the synergistic effect of SCORE2 and ApoB through concordant and discordant classifications, and (3) recalibration of the SCORE2 model by incorporating ApoB as an additional predictor. Each 0.2 g/L increase in ApoB was associated with an increased subdistribution hazard for CVD events (SHR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.11-1.14, p < 0.001), accounting for non-cardiovascular death as a competing risk. Threshold analysis identified an optimal ApoB cutoff at 1.18 g/L; however, it demonstrated limited discriminatory performance (area under the curve 0.54), with low sensitivity (32.4%) and moderate specificity (74.4%). Individuals with both low ApoB (<1.18 g/L) and low SCORE2 risk (<5%) had a lower CVD incidence rate (232.51 per 100,000 person-years) compared to those identified as low risk by SCORE2 alone (253.69 per 100,000 person-years). Integration of ApoB into the SCORE2 model did not significantly improve the model discrimination, calibration and net reclassification improvement. ApoB exhibited a dose-response relationship with cardiovascular risk but had limited standalone predictive utility within the UK Biobank population. However, combining ApoB with SCORE2 thresholds improved the identification of low-risk individuals, suggesting a complementary role for ApoB in refining cardiovascular risk stratification.","2025","European journal of preventive cardiology"

Plasma p-tau model-derived probabilities of amyloid PET positivity (amyloid beta [Aβ]+) classified participants into low-, intermediate-, or high-risk groups. In both cohorts, plasma p-tau217 outperformed p-tau181, especially in cognitively unimpaired participants (area under the curve = 0.921 [p-tau217] vs. 0.769 [p-tau181], Pdifference = 0.022). Including apolipoprotein E status and glial fibrillary acidic protein improved model fit. The negative predictive value of the low-risk group and positive predictive value of the high-risk group were 97.5% and 86.0%, respectively. Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 effectively predict Aβ+ among culturally different Asian populations. P-tau217 performed better, especially in the early stages of AD.

While effective in reducing portal pressure and preventing rebleeding, TIPS is associated with a considerable risk of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE), a complication that significantly elevates mortality rates. To develop a machine learning (ML) model to predict OHE occurrence post-TIPS in patients with AVB using a 5-year dataset. This retrospective single-center study included 218 patients with AVB who underwent TIPS. The dataset was divided into training (70%) and testing (30%) sets. Critical features were identified using embedded methods and recursive feature elimination. Three ML algorithms-random forest, extreme gradient boosting, and logistic regression-were validated via 10-fold cross-validation. SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis was employed to interpret the model's predictions. Survival analysis was conducted using Kaplan-Meier curves and stepwise Cox regression analysis to compare overall survival (OS) between patients with and without OHE. The median OS of the study cohort was 47.83 ± 22.95 months. Among the models evaluated, logistic regression demonstrated the highest performance with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.825. Key predictors identified were Child-Pugh score, age, and portal vein thrombosis. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that patients without OHE had a significantly longer OS (P = 0.005). The 5-year survival rate was 78.4%, with an OHE incidence of 15.1%. Both actual OHE status and predicted OHE value were significant predictors in each Cox model, with model-predicted OHE achieving an AUC of 88.1 in survival prediction.

The applicability and bias risk were evaluated using the Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST) checklist. A total of 1,472 studies were retrieved. Following the selection criteria, 18 prediction models sourced from 14 studies were incorporated into this review. In the field of model construction, only one study employed the use of multiple machine-learning techniques for the development of a model. In contrast, the remaining studies used logistic regression to construct FI risk prediction models. The incidence of FI in enteral nutrition was 32.4-63.1%. The top five predictors included in the model were APACHE II, age, albumin levels, intra-abdominal pressure, and mechanical ventilation. The reported AUC, or area under the curve, exhibited a range of values between 0.70 and 0.921. All studies were identified as having a high risk of bias, primarily due to the use of inappropriate data sources and inadequate reporting within the analysis domain. Although the included studies reported a certain degree of discriminatory power in their predictive models to identify feeding intolerance in patients undergoing enteral nutrition, the PROBAST assessment tool deemed all the included studies to carry a significant risk of bias. Future research should emphasize the development of innovative predictive models. These endeavors should incorporate more extensive and diverse sample sizes, adhere to stringent methodological designs, and undergo rigorous multicenter external validation to ensure robustness and generalizability.

We examined the predictive performance of FRAX without BMD in ethnically diverse, older patients with diabetes. Patients included were between ages 65-89 from the Kaiser Permanente Northern California Diabetes Registry and not already taking osteoporosis medications. Race and ethnicity were self-identified. We calculated FRAX without BMD based on baseline characteristics and assessed how well FRAX predicted MOF and hip fracture over follow-up. Predictive performance was based on measures of discrimination (area under the receiver operator curve, AUC) and calibration (observed-to-predicted ratio, O/P). We identified 96 914 patients (47.0% female), of whom 5383 (5.6%) and 1767 (1.8%) had MOF and hip fracture, respectively, over a mean follow-up of 4.3 years. The AUC for MOF and hip fracture were 0.72 and 0.77, respectively. FRAX mildly underestimated MOF and hip fracture rates (O/P 1.2 for both) overall. Discrimination was similar by race and ethnicity and diabetes duration but was worse in those over age 75 (AUC < 0.7). In some groups, there were substantial calibration errors, such as Hispanic women (O/P: 1.8 and 1.5), Black men (O/P: 1.5 and 1.8), those with duration of diabetes ≥20 years (O/P: 1.6 and 1.5), and those over the age of 80 (O/P: 1.4 and 1.2) for MOF and hip fracture, respectively. While the discriminatory performance of FRAX without BMD was good overall in patients with diabetes, it underestimated risk in Hispanic women, Black men, those with long duration of diabetes, and in the oldest patients with diabetes. These algorithmic biases suggest that diabetes-specific tools may be needed to stratify fracture risk in patients with diabetes.","2025","Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research"

This study aimed to elucidate the role of glucagon in peripheral nerve function in patients with T2D with different body mass indices (BMIs). We consecutively enrolled 174 individuals with T2D and obesity (T2D/OB, BMI ≥ 28 kg/m2), and 480 individuals with T2D and nonobesity (T2D/non-OB, BMI < 28 kg/m2), all of whom underwent oral glucose tolerance tests to determine the area under the curve for glucagon (AUCgla). Electromyography was utilized to assess overall composite Z-scores for latency, amplitude, and nerve conduction velocity (NCV) across all peripheral nerves, specifically examining the median, ulnar, common peroneal, posterior tibial, superficial peroneal, and sural nerves. In the T2D/OB group, the AUCgla exhibited a significant correlation with the latency, amplitude and NCV of each peripheral nerve, as well as with the overall composite Z-scores for latency (r = -0.283, p < 0.001), amplitude (r = 0.295, p < 0.001), and NCV (r = 0.362, p < 0.001). In contrast, the T2D/non-OB group did not exhibit obvious correlations between the AUCgla and the overall composite Z-scores for latency (r = -0.088, p = 0.056), amplitude (r = 0.054, p = 0.251), and NCV (r = 0.116, p = 0.012). Furthermore, multivariate linear regression analyses indicated that elevated AUCgla was independently associated with a lower overall composite Z-score for latency (β = -0.304, t = -3.391, p = 0.001), as well as higher overall composite Z-scores for amplitude (β = 0.256, t = 2.630, p = 0.010) and NCV (β = 0.286, t = 3.503, p = 0.001), after adjusting for other clinical covariates within the T2D/OB group.

Clinical parameters, NAC and conventional semiquantitative PET parameters were collected. The standard of reference considered was surgical pCR after NAC (ypT0;ypN0). Eight-hundred-fifty-four radiomic features (RFts) were extracted from both PET and CT datasets, according to IBSI; robust RFTs were selected. The cohort was split in training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. Four ML Models (Clinical Model, CT Model, PET Model_T and PET Model_T + N) each one with 3 learners (Random Forest (RF), Neural Network and Stochastic Gradient Descendent) were trained and tested using RFts and clinical signatures. PET Models were built considering robust RFTs extracted from either primary tumor alone (PET Model_T) or also including the reference lymph node (PET Model_T + N). 72 pathological uptakes (52 primary BC and 20 lymph node metastasis) at [18F]FDG PET/CT were segmented. pCR occurred in 44.2% cases. Twelve, 46 and 141 robust RFts were selected from CT Model, PET Model_T and PET Model_T + N, respectively. PET Models showed better performance than CT and Clinical Models. The best performances were obtained by the RF algorithm of the PET Model_T + N (AUC = 0.83;CA = 0.74;TP = 78%;TN = 72%).

Various scoring systems exist to identify patients at high risk for postoperative complications and death. In the following, we aim to evaluate and compare these different scoring systems. We analyzed data from 714 patients who underwent esophagectomy between 2002 and 2021. Each patient's risk was calculated using three models: the International Esodata Study Group (IESG) 90-day mortality risk prediction, the Steyerberg 30-day mortality score, and the Fuchs et al. preoperative in-hospital mortality score (Fuchs score). The diagnostic performance of these models was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Of the 714 patients, the majority (87.67%) underwent abdomino-thoracic esophagectomy with intrathoracic anastomosis. The IESG score classified 52.1% as very low, 26.6% low, 17.5% middle, 2.8% high, and 1% as very high risk, while the Fuchs score identified 94.5% as low-risk and 5.5% as high-risk patients. Mortality rates were 6.9% at 90 days, 3.4% at 30 days, and 6.7% in-hospital. The area under the ROC curve was 0.634 (95%CI: 0.557-0.712) for the IESG model, 0.637 (95%CI: 0.526-0.747) for the Steyerberg score, and 0.686 (95%CI: 0.611-0.760) for the Fuchs score.

However, due to variations in scanning conditions and image processing methodologies, the clinical utility of different parameters remains a subject of debate. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of multi-parameter 123I-3-Iodobenzylguanidine (MIBG) scintigraphy and to identify the most reliable metrics for distinguishing PD from Parkinson-plus syndromes. We recruited 56 PD patients and 44 non-PD controls, who underwent 123I-MIBG scintigraphy and clinical evaluation. MIBG uptake and washout rates (WR) for the heart, salivary glands, and thyroid were assessed, with semi-quantitative methods used to calculate heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) and gland-to-background (P/B, S/B, T/B) ratios. Diagnostic efficacy was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The H/M ratio and cardiac WR parameters scintigraphy exhibited excellent diagnostic efficacy for PD and PPS. The 4 h H/M ratio showed superior diagnostic performance with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.980. Background and time decay correction improved cardiac WR diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.963). Although P/B, S/B, and T/B ratios showed no significant differences for differential diagnosis, the WR values of the parotid and thyroid glands exhibited moderate diagnostic efficacy with AUCs of 0.648 and 0.638, respectively. The heart H/M ratio and cardiac WR in 123I-MIBG scintigraphy show high diagnostic efficacy for both diagnosing and differentiating PD. Including cardiac WR in routine assessments is recommended. The diagnostic potential of WR in the parotid and thyroid glands also holds promise for PD diagnosis. Incorporating these parameters could enhance the accuracy of PD diagnosis, particularly in clinical scenarios where concurrent cardiac disease may confound the diagnosis.","2025","EJNMMI research"

In this study, frailty was assessed preoperatively using a frailty index (FI) in 395 patients scheduled for gastrectomy for GC between January 2016 and December 2023. Patients were divided into two groups (high FI vs. low FI) to examine the impact of frailty on SSC and non-SSC. Overall complication and non-SSC rates were significantly higher in the high FI group, but the two groups had similar rates of SSC. In multivariate analysis, high FI, high BMI, and male were independent risk factors for non-SSC. The incidence of non-SSC was 0% in patients with no applicable risk factors, 3.6% in patients with one applicable risk factor, 13.0% in patients with two applicable risk factors, and 37.1% in patients with all three risk factors (Cochran-Armitage trend test, p < 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) of the risk prediction model using these three variables to predict non-SSC was 0.760. High FI was an independent risk factor for non-SSC in patients undergoing gastrectomy for GC. Our developed non-SSC risk model combining FI, BMI, and sex effectively identifies individuals at increased risk for non-SSC in GC patients.","2025","Gastric cancer : official journal of the International Gastric Cancer Association and the Japanese Gastric Cancer Association"

We characterised the transcriptome of paired peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and renal tissues in LN before and after cyclophosphamide (CYC) treatment and identified markers that predicted treatment response. Total RNA isolated from paired PBMCs (n = 32) and renal tissues (n = 25) of 16 proliferative LN before CYC treatment, 6 months post-treatment, and during renal flare, was sequenced on Illumina Novaseq-6000 platform. Post-treatment, eight patients were clinical responders (CR), of whom four flared (FL), and eight were non-responders (NR). Comparative transcriptomic analyses before and after treatment within CR, NR, and FL groups was performed using DESeq2. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) and ROC analysis was performed to identify and validate hub genes predictive of treatment response. Based on this, we observed that pathways such as degradation of cell cycle proteins, expression of G0 and G1 phase proteins, and apoptosis, were upregulated in CR PBMCs post-treatment, while IFN-γ signalling and ECM organisation were downregulated. In NR PBMCs, ECM molecules, neddylation and BCR signalling were upregulated post-CYC treatment, while in NR renal tissue, TLR, IFN and NF-κB signalling pathways were upregulated. In FL PBMCs, neutrophil degranulation and ROS and RNS production in phagocytes were downregulated following treatment, whereas, in the corresponding renal tissue, cell-ECM interactions and ISG15 antiviral mechanism were downregulated. After WGCNA and subsequent ROC analysis, TENM2, NLGN1 and AP005230.1 from PBMCs each predicted NR (AUC-0.91; p = 0.03), while combined model improved prediction (AUC-0.94; p = 0.02).

By integrating WGBS data with The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) UBC data, a DNA methylation-based biomarker was identified. When combined with a known UC biomarker AL021918.2, the performance of the dual-target test was evaluated in voided urine samples from 224 UC patients and 419 controls. Notable hypomethylation was observed in UC samples compared to normal samples. Through differential methylation analysis, differential methylation CpG sites, regions, and genes were identified. Of these, Transmembrane protein 106A gene (TMEM106A) was screened as a new UC biomarker. In a dual-target test, using triplex quantitative methylation-specific PCR (qMSP) to examine TMEM106A and AL021918.2 methylation levels, the training set showed a sensitivity of 89.0 %, a specificity of 92.9 %, and an area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.941 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.913-0.969).

In this study, 43 SZ patients and 55 normal controls (NCs) were included, and resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) and gut microbiota data were acquired for each participant. First, the brain features of brain images and functional brain networks were computed from rs-fMRI data; the gut features of gut microbiota abundance and the gut microbiota network were computed from gut microbiota data. Second, we propose a novel methodology to construct an individual brain-gut microbiota network (BGMN) for each participant by combining the brain and gut features via multiple strategies. Third, discriminative models between SZ patients and NCs were built using the connectivity matrices of the BGMN as input features. Moreover, the correlations between the most discriminative features and the scores of symptom severity and neurocognition were analyzed in SZ patients. The results showed that the best discriminative model between SZ patients and NCs was achieved using the connectivity matrices of the BGMN when all the brain and gut features were integrated, with an accuracy of 0.90 and an area under the curve value of 0.97. The most discriminative features were related primarily to the genera Faecalibacterium and Collinsella, in which the genus Faecalibacterium was linked to the visual system and subcortical cortices and the genus Collinsella was linked to the default network and subcortical cortices. Furthermore, parts of the most discriminative features were significantly correlated with the scores of neurocognition in the SZ patients.

However, these analyses are usually performed independently, without integrating the information derived from each of them. Clustering of survival data is an underexplored problem, and current approaches are limited for biomedical applications, whose data are usually heterogeneous and multimodal, with poor scalability for high-dimensionality. We introduce VAE-Surv, a multimodal computational framework for patients' stratification and prognosis prediction. VAE-Surv integrates a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), which reduces the high-dimensional space characterizing the molecular data, with a deep survival model, which combines the embedded information with the clinical features. The VAE embedding step prioritizes local coherence within the feature space to detect potential nonlinear relationships among the molecular markers. The latent representation is then exploited to perform K-means clustering. To test the clinical robustness of the algorithm, VAE-Surv was applied to the Genomed4all cohort of Myelodysplastic Syndromes (MDS), comparing the identified subtypes with the World Health Organization (WHO) classification. The survival outcome was compared with the state-of-the-art Cox model and its penalized versions. Finally, to assess the generalizability of the results, the method was also validated on an external MDS cohort. Tested on 2,043 patients in the GenomMed4All cohort, VAE-Surv achieved a median C-index of 0.78, outperforming classical approaches. In addition, the latent space enhanced the clustering performance compared to a traditional approach that applies the clustering directly to the input data. Compared to the WHO 2016 MDS subtypes, the analysis of the identified clusters showed that the proposed framework can capture existing clinical categorizations while also suggesting novel, data-driven patient groups. Even tested in an external MDS cohort of 2,384 patients, VAE-Surv achieved a good prediction performance (median C-index=0.74), preserving the interpretability of the main clinical and genetic features. VAE-Surv enables automatic identification of patients' clusters, while outperforming the traditional CoxPH model in survival prediction tasks at the same time. Applied to MDS use case, the obtained genetic-based clusters exhibit a clear survival stratification, and the application of the clinical information allowed high performance in prognosis prediction.","2025","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

This study suggests combining the Decision Tree (DT) algorithm with advanced, math-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms to address these limitations. In this study, the FSM was prepared using a combination of the DT non-parametric algorithm and three math-based metaheuristic optimization algorithms, including the gradient-based optimizer (GBO), chaos game optimization (CGO), and arithmetic optimization algorithm (AOA). Four models were developed and compared for modeling and mapping: the basic DT, DT-AOA, DT-GBO, and DT-CGO. The DT-CGO model stood out on the training set, achieving the lowest root mean square error (RMSE) of 0.17. It was closely followed by DT-AOA (0.19), DT-GBO (0.2), and DT (0.201). In terms of mean absolute error (MAE), the DT-CGO model exhibited the lowest value of 0.06, followed by DT-AOA (0.07), DT-GBO (0.079), and the basic DT model (0.08).

However, comprehensive health status assessment tools for this complex population are lacking. This study aimed to develop and validate an explainable machine learning model to evaluate overall health status in patients with comorbid CHD and depression. Utilizing data from the 2021-2022 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, we developed and externally validated machine learning models to predict overall health status, defined as having both poor physical and mental health for ≥ 14 days in the past 30 days. Eleven machine learning algorithms were evaluated, including artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and ensemble methods. The SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was employed to enhance model interpretability. Model performance was assessed using discrimination, calibration, and decision curve analysis. The study included 9,747 participants in the derivation cohort and 8,394 in the external validation cohort. Among the eleven algorithms evaluated, an optimized XGBoost model with eight key features demonstrated balanced performance. SHAP analysis revealed that employment status, physical activity, income, and age were the most influential predictors. The model maintained good discrimination (AUC 0.712, 95% CI 0.703-0.721 in derivation; AUC 0.711, 95% CI 0.701-0.721 in validation), calibration and clinical utility across both cohorts. Our explainable machine learning model provides a novel, comprehensive approach to assessing health status in patients with comorbid CHD and depression, offering valuable insights for personalized management strategies.","2025","International journal of medical informatics"

Although deep learning effectively deciphers DTIs, most deep learning-based methods represent drug features from only a single perspective. Moreover, the fusion method of drug and protein features needs further refinement. To address the above two problems, in this study, we develop a novel end-to-end framework named DO-GMA for potential DTI identification by incorporating Depthwise Overparameterized convolutional neural network and the Gated Multihead Attention mechanism with shared-learned queries and bilinear model concatenation. DO-GMA first designs a depthwise overparameterized convolutional neural network to learn drug representations from their SMILES strings and protein representations from their amino acid sequences. Next, it extracts drug representations from their 2D molecular graphs through a graph convolutional network. Subsequently, it fuses drug and protein features by combining the gated attention mechanism and the multihead attention mechanism with shared-learned queries and bilinear model concatenation. Finally, it takes the fused drug-target features as inputs and builds a multilayer perceptron to classify unlabeled drug-target pairs (DTPs). DO-GMA was benchmarked against six newest DTI prediction methods (CPI-GNN, BACPI, CPGL, DrugBAN, BINDTI, and FOTF-CPI) under four different experimental settings on four DTI data sets (i.e., DrugBank, BioSNAP, C.elegans, and BindingDB). The results show that DO-GMA significantly outperformed the above six methods based on AUC, AUPR, accuracy, F1-score, and MCC. An ablation study, robust statistical analysis, sensitivity analysis of parameters, visualization of the fused features, computational cost analysis, and case analysis further validated the powerful DTI identification performance of DO-GMA. In addition, DO-GMA predicted that two drug-protein pairs (i.e., DB00568 and P06276, and DB09118 and Q9UQD0) could be interacting.

However, ATO administration requires daily infusions over several months, representing an onerous burden for hospitals and patients. We evaluated the bioavailability of a novel encapsulated oral ATO formulation in APL patients in first complete remission during standard-of-care consolidation. After a pilot study exploring the likely oral dose requirement, total arsenic pharmacokinetics were evaluated in 20 patients after both intravenous and oral ATO 0.15 mg/kg/d, with exposure to oral ATO restricted to the first week in 2 of the 4 ATO cycles. The primary endpoint was bioequivalence of area under the curve from 0-24 hours (AUC0-24), with bioequivalence of maximum concentration achieved (Cmax) as the key secondary endpoint. The 90% confidence intervals (CI) around point estimates of the geometric means of the oral/intravenous ratios for AUC0-24 and Cmax were compared with bioequivalence limits specified by the European Medicines Agency (0.80-1.25). The estimated oral/intravenous ratios and 90% CI for AUC0-24 in whole blood and plasma were 0.993 (0.954-1.034) and 1.030 (0.977-1.087) respectively; data for Cmax also satisfied bioequivalence requirements. Exploratory studies of arsenic species in plasma showed bioequivalence for AUC0-24 with As(III) (oral/intravenous ratio 0.966 (0.879-1.063)). The adverse event profiles of oral and intravenous ATO were comparable for cycles commencing with the IV and oral formulations. In conclusion, this novel oral ATO formulation is bioequivalent with intravenous ATO and offers a convenient alternative for patients with APL.

Non-ischemic DCM patients were prospectively enrolled. Regional adipose tissue, cardiac function, and myocardial tissue characteristics were measured by cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The primary endpoint included all-cause mortality and heart transplantation (HTX). This study enrolled 1042 DCM patients (68% men, mean age 48 ± 15 years, mean BMI 23.9 ± 4.0 kg/m2). Underweight patients were more frequently women, had lower blood pressure, worse New York Heart Association (NYHA) class, reduced biventricular ejection fraction, and higher native T1 and extracellular volume fraction (ECV) value. Similarly, reduced regional adipose tissue was associated with adverse heart remodeling, worse cardiac function, and higher diffuse myocardial fibrosis. After a median follow-up of 41 months, primary endpoint occurred in 237 patients. BMI (HR: 0.94, 95% CI: 0.90 - 0.98, P = 0.006), VAT thickness (per 1 mm: HR 0.94, 95% CI: 0.91 - 0.97, P < 0.001), and EAT volume (per 1 mL: HR 0.96, 95% CI: 0.95 - 0.97, P < 0.001) were independent predictors of primary endpoint. EAT volume showed highest predictive value for heart failure death/HTX (C-index: 0.70). BMI was the best predictor of arrhythmia endpoint (C-index: 0.64). Lower BMI and thinner regional adipose tissue represented the worse clinical phenotype and adverse remodeling, and were associated with worse clinical outcomes in patients with DCM.","2025","European journal of preventive cardiology"

We reanalyzed 2D, Doppler, and STE data obtained from two cohorts: derivation (654 patients, median age: 82 years; 51% men) and validation (237 patients, median age: 77 years; 55% men) with at least moderate AS (aortic valve area<1.5 cm2). The receiver operator characteristic curve analysis identified optimal cut-off values linked to outcomes: 15% for left ventricular global longitudinal strain (LVGLS), 13% for peak atrial longitudinal strain (PALS), and 19% for right ventricular free-wall strain (RVFWS). Patients have been divided into five stages: Stage 0 - no left-side damage (LVGLS≥15% and PALS≥13%); Stage 1 - partial left-side damage (LVGLS <15% or PALS <13%); Stage 2 - definite left-side damage, (LVGLS<15% and PALS<13%); Stage 3, no right-side damage (RVFWS≥19%); and Stage 4, right-side damage (RVFWS<19%). In a multivariable Cox regression analysis, the new staging scheme remained independently associated with an increased risk of all-cause death (adjusted-hazard ratio [aHR]: 1.28; 95%CI: 1.10-1.48; p=0.001).

To evaluate the diagnostic capability for glaucoma and the correlation between peripapillary and macular parameters using spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) and optic nerve head hemoglobin (OHN Hb) levels assessed by the Laguna ONhE® software using colorimetric analysis. This cross-sectional study included 112 eyes from 112 primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) patients and 112 eyes from 112 healthy controls. The peripapillary analysis included standard peripapillary retinal nerve fiber layer (pRNFL), Bruch's membrane opening-minimum ring width (BMO-MRW), and peripapillary RNFL thickness measured with the Glaucoma Module Premium Edition program (RNFLT). The macular analysis assessed the ganglion cell layer (GCL), inner plexiform layer (IPL), macular RNFL (mRNFL), total retina, ganglion cell complex (GCC), and the GCL-IPL complex. The Laguna ONhE program evaluated ONH Hb levels and the glaucoma discriminant function (GDF). Pearson correlation was used to analyze the relationships between variables, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated. Significant differences in AUC were found between GDF (0.80) and RNFLT global (G) (0.91), BMO-MRW G (0.89), and outer-temporal GCL (0.88). BMO-MRW showed the strongest correlation with the Laguna ONhE parameters (r from 0.271 to 0.682). Additionally, a significant correlation was observed between the temporal-inferior sector of ONH Hb and the inferior macular sector (r=0.40-0.56 for GCL-IPL) (P<0.05 for all). GDF demonstrated lower diagnostic capacity compared to other structural tests.

We developed autoML models integrating clinical, biochemical, X-ray and MRI data. Using two data sets within the OA Initiative-the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health OA Biomarker Consortium for training and hold-out validation, and the Pivotal Osteoarthritis Initiative MRI Analyses study for external validation-we employed two distinct definitions of clinical outcomes: Multiclass (categorising OA progression into pain and/or radiographic) and binary. Key predictors of progression were identified through advanced interpretability techniques, and subgroup analyses were conducted by age, sex and ethnicity with a focus on early-stage disease. Although the most reliable models incorporated all available features, simpler models including only clinical variables achieved robust external validation performance, with area under the precision-recall curve (AUC-PRC) 0.727 (95% CI: 0.726 to 0.728) for multiclass predictions; and AUC-PRC 0.764 (95% CI: 0.762 to 0.766) for binary predictions. Multiclass models performed best in patients with early-stage OA (AUC-PRC 0.724-0.806) whereas binary models were more reliable in patients younger than 60 (AUC-PRC 0.617-0.693). Patient-reported outcomes and MRI features emerged as key predictors of progression, though subgroup differences were noted. Finally, we developed web-based applications to visualise our personalised predictions. Our novel tool's transparency and reliability in predicting rapid knee OA progression distinguish it from conventional 'black-box' methods and are more likely to facilitate its acceptance by clinicians and patients, enabling effective implementation in clinical practice.","2025","Annals of the rheumatic diseases"

Eighty New Zealand rabbits were randomly divided into control (N = 10) and RF (N = 70) groups, consisting of baseline, 7, 14, 21, and 28 days (N = 12 in each), and longitudinal (N = 10) subgroups. RF was induced via unilateral renal arteria stenosis. 3 T, QSM with gradient echo, arterial spin labeling with gradient spin echo. Bilateral kidney QSM values (χ) in the cortex (χCO) and outer medulla (χOM) were evaluated with histopathology. Analysis of variance, Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman's correlation, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). P < 0.05 was significant. In fibrotic kidneys, χCO decreased at 7 days ([-6.69 ± 0.98] × 10-2 ppm) and increased during 14-28 days ([-1.85 ± 2.11], [0.14 ± 0.58], and [1.99 ± 0.60] × 10-2 ppm, respectively), while the χOM had the opposite trend. Both significantly correlated with histopathology (|r| = 0.674-0.849). AUC of QSM for distinguishing RF degrees was 0.692-0.993. In contralateral kidneys, the χCO initially decreased ([-6.67 ± 0.84] × 10-2 ppm) then recovered to baseline ([-4.81 ± 0.89] × 10-2 ppm), while the χOM at 7-28 days ([2.58 ± 1.40], [2.25 ± 1.83], [2.49 ± 2.11], [2.43 ± 1.32] × 10-2 ppm, respectively) were significantly higher than baseline ([0.54 ± 0.18] × 10-2 ppm). Different iron deposition patterns were observed in RF with QSM values, suggesting the potential of QSM for iron deposition monitoring in RF. Renal fibrosis (RF) is a common outcome in most kidney diseases, leading to scarring and loss of kidney function. Increasing evidence suggests that abnormal iron metabolism plays an important role in RF. This study used a technique called quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) to measure kidney iron levels in rabbits with RF. Specifically, rabbits with advanced RF exhibited higher kidney iron concentrations, and moderate to strong correlations between QSM values and histopathology demonstrated that QSM could accurately detect changes in iron levels and assess RF severity. Overall, QSM shows promise as a tool for monitoring iron deposition in RF progression. 2 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 3.","2025","Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI"

We examined whether psoas muscle gauge could predict all-cause mortality and new cardiovascular events more accurately than psoas muscle index in these patients. We retrospectively included 217 hemodialysis patients who underwent abdominal computed tomography. We calculated the psoas muscle gauge (arbitrary unit [AU]) at the fourth lumbar vertebra level as follows: PMI (cm2/m2) × PMD (Hounsfield units). We categorized the patients into higher and lower psoas muscle gauge groups based on sex-specific cutoffs obtained from the young Asian population. The outcomes were death and new cardiovascular events. The psoas muscle gauge cutoffs were set at 231.1 and 328.8 AU in women and men, respectively. Eighty-five deaths and 95 new cardiovascular events occurred during the follow-up period of 4.4 (2.4-7.3) years. The 5-year survival rates were 59.2% and 94.9% in the lower and higher psoas muscle gauge groups, respectively (p < 0.0001). Moreover, after adjusting for sex and age, history of cardiovascular disease, C-reactive protein, modified creatinine index, and geriatric nutritional risk index, lower psoas muscle gauge was independently associated with increased all-cause death and new cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) 7.65; 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.37-24.66 and aHR 2.98; 95% CI 1.54-5.75, respectively). The concordance index (C-index) for predicting all-cause mortality and new cardiovascular events significantly improved when either psoas muscle index or psoas muscle gauge were added to the baseline risk model. Additionally, the C-index of the psoas muscle gauge-added model was significantly higher than that of the psoas muscle index-added model (0.815 vs. 0.784, p = 0.026) only when predicting all-cause mortality. Psoas muscle gauge accurately predicted the risk of all-cause mortality and new cardiovascular events in patients undergoing hemodialysis.

This study aimed to determine whether quantitative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) features can identify DCIS at risk of upstaging to invasive cancer. This prospective observational clinical trial analyzed women with a diagnosis of DCIS on CNB. All the participants underwent preoperative 3T MRI. Quantitative MRI features from routine dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MR images (e.g., peak percent enhancement [PE]) and from advanced high temporal-resolution DCE MR images (e.g., Ktrans) were measured. Clinical, pathologic, and mammographic features were reviewed. Associations with upstaging were summarized using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Of 58 DCIS lesions at CNB, 15 (26%) were upstaged to invasive cancer at surgery. Of the 58 lesions, 46 (79%) enhanced on MRI, although enhancement alone was not significantly associated with upstaging (p = 0.71). Among the DCIS lesions that enhanced, higher PE was most strongly associated with upstaging (AUC, 0.81; adjusted p = 0.009) and outperformed MRI features acquired via high temporal resolution DCE-MRI (AUC, 0.50-0.73). Lesion span on MRI was not significantly associated with upstaging risk (AUC, 0.55; adjusted p = 0.61), nor were any clinical, pathologic, or mammographic features (p > 0.24). Quantitative features acquired from routine clinical breast MRI and advanced DCE-MRI demonstrated good performance in identifying which DCIS lesions were upstaged to invasive cancer at excision. These features may prove valuable for appropriate selection of active surveillance in future DCIS de-escalation trials.","2025","Annals of surgical oncology"

Despite its popularity, postoperative complications can significantly deteriorate patient quality of life and prognosis. Therefore, identifying risk factors for these complications is crucial for early detection and intervention. This research is designed to construct and validate a predictive model for assessing the risk of postoperative complications in patients undergoing robotic-assisted radical gastrectomy. A retrospective analysis was conducted on 500 GC patients from Gansu Provincial People's Hospital between December 2016 and October 2023. These patients formed the training cohort. An additional 136 patients from the 940th Hospital of Joint Logistic Support Force, the Chinese People's Liberation Army as the external validation cohort. Patients were categorized into groups with and without complications. Data collected included demographic details, laboratory results, CT quantitative body composition analysis, and clinical information. Variable selection was conducted through Lasso regression, succeeded by multivariable logistic regression to pinpoint independent risk factors. These elements facilitated the construction of a nomogram for prediction. The model's performance underwent internal validation via bootstrap techniques and external validation through a validation cohort. The efficacy of the model was quantified by the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), evaluated for calibration using calibration curves and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, and assessed for clinical utility through decision curve analysis (DCA). Of the 500 patients in the training cohort, 65 experienced complications, a rate of 13%. The validation cohort had a similar complication rate of 13.24% (18 out of 136 patients). Independent risk factors identified included tumor diameter (OR = 1.99, 95% CI = 1.07-3.73), TNM stage III (OR = 2.12, 95% CI = 1.03-4.36), ASA class I (OR = 0.26, 95% CI = 0.13-0.53), ASA class III (OR = 4.75, 95% CI = 2.12-10.62), and visceral fat area (VFA) (OR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.10-5.79).

The V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and subjected to high-throughput sequencing using the Illumina MiSeq platform. Additionally, a dataset with the accession number PRJNA450340 from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) was incorporated into the study. The sequencing data underwent processing and analysis utilizing QIIME2. To construct microbiome-based diagnostic models, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Generalized Linear Model (GLM) methodologies were employed, with the self-test data functioning as the training set and the PRJNA450340 dataset serving as the validation set. The results indicated that patients with RA exhibited a significantly reduced gut microbial α-diversity compared with the HCs group. The β-diversity analysis demonstrated notable distinctions in the gut microbiota structure between RA patients and HCs. Variations in the gut microbiome composition between RA patients and HCs were evident at both the phylum and genus levels. LEfSe analysis revealed a substantial number of significantly different microbiota between RA patients and HC, and 7 key genera were obtained by intersection of the different flora in the two data sets: Ruminococcus_gnavus_group, Fusicatenibacter, Butyricicoccus, Subdoligranulum, Erysipelotrichaceae_UCG-003, Romboutsia, and Dorea. Utilizing these seven core genera, RA diagnostic models were developed employing RF, SVM, and GLM methodologies. The GLM model exhibited consistent performance, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 71.03% in the training set and 74.71% in the validation set. Notable differences in gut microbiota exist between RA patients and healthy individuals. Diagnostic models based on key microbial genera hold potential for aiding in the early identification of individuals at risk for developing RA, thereby suggesting new avenues for its diagnosis.","2025","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)"

Materials and Methods Adults with painful knee conditions were prospectively enrolled from December 2021 to October 2022. Participants underwent fourfold SMSx2-PIx2-accelerated standard-of-care and investigational DL superresolution MRI at 3 T. Seven radiologists independently evaluated the MRI examinations for overall image quality (using Likert scale scores: 1, very bad, to 5, very good) and the presence or absence of meniscus and ligament tears. Articular cartilage was categorized as intact, or partial or full-thickness defects. Statistical analyses included interreader agreements (Cohen κ and Gwet AC2) and diagnostic performance testing used area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values. Results A total of 116 adults (mean age, 45 years ± 15 [SD]; 74 men) who underwent arthroscopic surgery within 38 days ± 22 were evaluated. Overall image quality was better for DL superresolution MRI (median Likert score, 5; range, 3-5) than conventional MRI (median Likert score, 4; range, 3-5) (P < .001).

Differentiation of type A IRS from type 2 diabetes on the basis of hyperinsulinemia can be challenging. Given the association between insulin receptor dysfunction and reduced insulin clearance, we evaluated the potential of the circulating C-peptide reactivity (CPR)/immunoreactive insulin (IRI) molar ratio, a marker of insulin clearance, for distinguishing type A IRS from type 2 diabetes. We retrospectively analyzed CPR and IRI levels measured during a 75-g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 18 individuals with type A IRS and 126 with type 2 diabetes. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to determine the diagnostic performance of the CPR/IRI molar ratio and IRI levels. IRI levels were significantly higher and the CPR/IRI molar ratio significantly lower in individuals with type A IRS compared with those with type 2 diabetes. The area under the ROC curve for the CPR/IRI molar ratio at baseline, 1 hour, and 2 hours after OGTT initiation was 0.997 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 99.2%), 0.999 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 97.6%), and 0.997 (sensitivity 100%, specificity 95.1%), respectively. The CPR/IRI molar ratio demonstrated robust diagnostic performance regardless of body mass index or hyperinsulinemia severity. The CPR/IRI molar ratio, both at baseline and during OGTT, exhibited higher sensitivity and specificity than IRI levels alone for distinguishing type A IRS from type 2 diabetes. This ratio may serve as a reliable clinical marker for early and accurate diagnosis of type A IRS.","2025","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism"

Retrospective record review and analysis of 134 patients admitted with early-onset pre-eclampsia. Demographic data, symptoms, and investigation results relevant to the fullPIERS calculator present on admission were collected. Adverse maternal outcomes occurring before the end of 7 days from admission were recorded. Descriptive analysis was conducted, χ2 and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to evaluate the association between fullPIERS parameters, score, and adverse outcomes. Performance of fullPIERS score was evaluated by positive and negative predictive values, sensitivity, specificity, and receiver operating curve analysis. The median age was 34 years (interquartile range [IQR] 28-37 years). A total of 131 deliveries were recorded at a median gestation of 31 weeks (IQR 29-33 weeks). Most deliveries (71; 54.2%) were due to fetal indications and 102 (77.9%) were by cesarean section. A total of 20 (15.1%) patients had adverse maternal outcomes. Three (2.6%) neonates were delivered with Apgar score less than 7 at 5 minutes and were all admitted to the neonatal intensive care unit. FullPIERS formula predicted adverse maternal outcomes with positive and negative predictive values of 100% and 94.9%, respectively, and sensitivity and specificity of 70% and 100%, respectively. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.88 (95% confidence interval 0.75-0.95), which shows good discrimination.

The aim of our study was to explore more reliable indicators in early differential diagnosis of these cysts. We recruited a total of 50 cases with a prenatal diagnosis of hepatic cyst at three centers, and patients were divided into a CBA group (n = 16) and CC group (n = 34) according to postnatal intraoperative diagnosis. Patient features, maximal cyst diameter as measured by prenatal and early postnatal ultrasonography were analyzed and compared between the two groups, as was the effect of cyst size in predicting CBA. The maximal cyst diameters in the last prenatal ultrasound (LPU) measurement and initial postnatal ultrasound (IPU) in the CBA group were significantly smaller than in the CC group, as was the difference between the IPU and the first prenatal ultrasound (FPU) (i.e., IPU-FPU) in the CBA group relative to the CC group. The IPU-FPU difference showed the best diagnostic performance as a single parameter (AUC, 0.9806), with a sensitivity and specificity of 100% and 90.3%, respectively, and a cutoff value of 7.5 mm. Ultrasonographic measurement of the maximal cyst diameter can assist in early (within 1 week after birth) identification of CBA.

Most deep-learning-based convolutional neural network (CNN) systems for computer-aided diagnosis of oral lesions have typically concentrated on determining limited aspects of differential diagnosis. This study aimed to develop a CNN-based diagnostic model capable of classifying clinical photographs of oral ulcerative and associated lesions into five different diagnoses, thereby assisting clinicians in making accurate differential diagnoses. A set of clinical images were selected, including 506 images of five different diagnoses. The images were pre-processed and randomly divided into two sets for training and testing the CNN model. The model architecture was composed of convolutional layers, batch normalization layers, max pooling layers, the dropout layer and fully-connected layers. Evaluation metrics included weighted-precision, weighted-recall, weighted-F1 score, average specificity, Cohen's Kappa coefficient, normalized confusion matrix and AUC. The overall performance for the image classification showed a weighted-precision of 88.8%, a weighted-recall of 88.2%, a weighted-F1 score of 0.878, an average pecificity of 97.0%, a Kappa coefficient of 0.851, and an average AUC of 0.985. The model achieved a decent classification performance (overall AUC=0.985), showing the capacity to discern between benign and malignant potential lesions, and laid the foundation of a novel tool that can help clinical differential diagnosis of oral mucosal lesions. The main challenges were the small and imbalanced dataset. Enlarging the minority classes, incorporating more oral mucosal lesion diagnoses, employing transfer learning and cross-validation might be included in future works to optimize the image classification model.","2025","Journal of dental sciences"

This cross-sectional study included men who have sex with men with HIV. Participants underwent HRA, aLBC, and biomarker testing. Three screening procedures were compared with aLBC: biomarker alone, cytology and biomarker in all, and cytology and reflex biomarkers (biomarkers applied if aLBC results were atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion). Biomarkers included Linear Array (LA), LA for 14 high-risk human papillomavirus (LA 14 HR-HPV) genotypes, LA HPV-16, Hybrid Capture 2 (HC2), E6/E7 mRNA, and E6/E7 mRNA HPV-16. Of 354 participants, 179 (50.6%) had atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse, requiring HRA (sensitivity, 80%; specificity, 57.3%; area under the curve, 0.687; reference, biopsy-proven HSIL). Cytology and reflex biomarkers per E6/E7 mRNA, LA 14 HR-HPV, and HC2 and the biomarker-alone procedure with HC2 showed comparable accuracy (sensitivities: 71.6%, 78.8%, 73.1%, 75.7%; specificities: 73.5%, 67.9%, 76.1%, 65.5%; areas under the curve: 0.726, 0.734, 0.746, 0.706) with fewer HRA referrals (number needed to diagnose: 2.2, 2.1, 2, 2.4).

This canine cancer is analogous to human angiosarcoma, and the development of liquid biopsies leveraging cell-free DNA (cfDNA) represents a promising step forward in early cancer diagnosis. In this study, we utilized Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) to analyze fragment sizes and copy number alterations (CNAs) in cfDNA from 21 hemangiosarcoma-affected and 36 healthy dogs, aiming to enhance early cancer detection accuracy through machine learning models. Our findings reveal that similar to trends in human oncology, hemangiosarcoma samples exhibited shorter DNA fragment sizes compared to healthy controls, with a notable leftward shift in the primary peak. Interestingly, canine hemangiosarcoma DNA fragment sizes demonstrated eight distinct periodic patterns diverging from those typically observed in human angiosarcoma. Additionally, we identified seven novel genomic gains and nine losses in the hemangiosarcoma samples. Applying machine learning to the cfDNA fragment size distribution, we achieved an impressive average Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.93 in 10-fold cross-validation, underscoring the potential of this approach for precise early-stage cancer classification. This study confirms distinctive cfDNA fragment size and CNA patterns in hemangiosarcoma-affected vs. healthy dogs and demonstrates the promise of these biomarkers in canine cancer screening, early detection, and monitoring via liquid biopsies.

We measured 30 plasma proteins in 49 controls (CTL), 36 individuals with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and 52 patients diagnosed with probable AD. After applying strict filters for quantification limits, only 13 analytes were included in the analysis. Kruskal-Wallis tests showed significant differences between diagnostic groups for nine cytokines (IL-16, IL-7, VEGF, IL-8, eotaxin, MCP-1, MCP-4, MDC and TARC). Non-parametric MANCOVA showed that sex and diagnosis affected cytokine levels in the blood. To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the markers, we performed receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Only those analytes that showed an area under the curve (AUC) ≥ 0.70 were included in the multivariate logistic regression models to better understand the contribution of cytokines to clinical status. Three models: 1) CTL vs. AD; 2) CTL vs. MCI, and 3) MCI vs. AD were developed, with sex and age as covariates. In each model, two cytokines remained significantly different (model 1: IL-16 and MDC; model 2: eotaxin and MDC and model 3: IL-7 and VEGF).

Despite the widespread use of the BODE index and its variants for mortality prediction, their accuracy may be affected by factors like ethnicity, altitude and regional disparities. This study aimed to assess a new altitude-adapted prognostic index in COPD patients at moderate altitudes compared with the BODE and other mortality predictors. We evaluated the performance of BODE and other standard prognostic indexes in an exploratory cohort of COPD patients using Cox proportional hazards models. Additionally, we developed a new risk-weighted prognostics model. We assessed its performance utilising receiver operating characteristic curves and compared it with BODE index variants. The indices were validated in a second cohort. The mean follow-up period in both cohorts was 7 years. In the exploratory cohort (n=416), COPD patients had a 77% 5-year survival rate. eBODE exhibited superior predictive capacity (HR 1.22, 95% CI 1.11-1.34, p<0.05). Prognostic models included oxygen saturation measured by pulse oximetry <90%, body mass index, 6-min walk test (6MWT) and current smoking as primary relevant risks (BOSEA-90), with the second model excluding 6MWT (BOSA-90). BOSEA-90 predicted a major risk per point (HR 1.41, 95% CI 1.31-1.51, p<0.001) and superior discrimination (area under the curve (AUC) >0.75) compared to other indices (AUC <0.70, p<0.001). The validation cohort (n=436) confirmed effectiveness in differentiating mild and very severe cases.

Clinical data and hepatic pathological features and the correlation between serum GP73 and liver fibrosis were assessed. A new algorithm was conducted after logistic regression. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve was used to compare its diagnostic performance with traditional models. Significant fibrosis was diagnosed in 37.2% (85/228) patients. Serum GP73 levels were markedly higher in patients with significant fibrosis than in those without (128 ng/mL v.s 46 ng/mL, p< 0.001). Serum GP73 levels independently predicted significant liver fibrosis (adjusted odds ratio, aOR 1.028, p< 0.001).

This research focuses on examining the relationship between IR and all-cause mortality in individuals with DKD. This study utilized data obtained from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), spanning the years 2001 to 2018. Insulin resistance was assessed using reliable indicators (HOMA-IR, TyG, TyG-BMI, and METS-IR). The relationship between IR indices and survival outcomes was evaluated through weighted multivariate Cox regression, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, and restricted cubic spline (RCS) modeling. To examine non-linear associations, the log-likelihood ratio test was employed, with piecewise regression models used to establish confidence intervals and identify threshold values. Diagnostic precision and efficacy were gauged using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves, Area Under the Curve (AUC) evaluations, and calibration plots. Moreover, to verify the consistency of our results, stratified analyses and interaction tests were conducted across variables including age, gender, Body Mass Index (BMI), hypertension, and cardiovascular status. This research involved a group of 1,588 individuals diagnosed with DKD. Over a median observation period of 74 months, 630 participants passed away. Using weighted multivariate Cox regression along with restricted cubic spline modeling, we identified non-linear associations between the four insulin resistance indices and all-cause mortality. An analysis of threshold effects pinpointed essential turning points for each IR index in this research: 1.14 for HOMA-IR, 9.18 for TyG, 207.9 for TyG-BMI, and 35.85 for METS-IR. It was noted that levels below these thresholds inversely correlated with all-cause mortality. In contrast, values above these points showed a significantly positive correlation, suggesting heightened mortality risks. The accuracy of these four IR metrics as indicators of all-cause mortality was confirmed through ROC and calibration curve analyses. In patients with DKD, an L-shaped association is noted between HOMA-IR and all-cause mortality, while TyG, TyG-BMI, and METS-IR exhibit U-shaped relationships.

Despite the growing recognition of histone modifications in tumor progression, their role in LGG remains poorly understood. This study aimed to develop a histone modification-based risk signature and investigate its relationship with drug sensitivity to guide personalized treatment strategies. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing analysis on LGG samples (n = 4) to characterize histone modification patterns. Through integrative analysis of TCGA-LGG (n = 513) and CGGA datasets (n = 693 and n = 325), we constructed a histone modification-related risk signature (HMRS) using machine learning approaches. The model's performance was validated in multiple independent cohorts. We further conducted comprehensive analyses of molecular mechanisms, immune microenvironment, and drug sensitivity associated with the risk stratification. We identified distinct histone modification patterns across five major cell populations in LGG and developed a robust 20-gene HMRS from 129 candidate genes that effectively stratified patients into high- and low-risk groups with significantly different survival outcomes (training set: AUC = 0.77, 0.73, and 0.71 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival; P < 0.001). Integration of HMRS with clinical features further improved prognostic accuracy (C-index >0.70). High-risk tumors showed activation of TGF-β and IL6-JAK-STAT3 signaling pathways, and distinct mutation profiles including TP53 (63% vs 28%), IDH1 (68% vs 85%), and ATRX (46% vs 20%) mutations. The high-risk group demonstrated significantly elevated immune and stromal scores (P < 0.001), with distinct patterns of immune cell infiltration, particularly in memory CD4+ T cells (P < 0.001) and CD8+ T cells (P = 0.001). Drug sensitivity analysis revealed significant differential responses to six therapeutic agents including Temozolomide and targeted drugs (P < 0.05). Our study establishes a novel histone modification-based prognostic model that not only accurately predicts LGG patient outcomes but also reveals potential therapeutic targets. The identified associations between risk stratification and drug sensitivity provide valuable insights for personalized treatment strategies. This integrated approach offers a promising framework for improving LGG patient care through molecular-based risk assessment and treatment selection.","2024","Frontiers in pharmacology"

The endpoint events of this study were clinical worsening outcomes. PH patients include those from group 1 and group 4. AIP was determined as the logarithm of the blood triglycerides ratio to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. The 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year incidence rates of clinical worsening outcomes in PH patients in this study were 20.0, 44.8, and 54.4%, respectively. The median age of the PH patients was 38.00 years, with females accounting for 90.4%. After controlling for multivariable factors, the results of Cox regression analysis indicated that AIP was an independent predictor of adverse outcomes with a hazard ratio and 95% confident interval (CI) of 2.426 (1.021-5.763). The positive linear relationship of AIP was evaluated using restricted cubic spline analysis. Kaplan-Meier curves showed a significantly higher events rate in patients with AIP ≥ 0.144 compared to those with AIP < 0.144 (p = 0.002). Four potential prognostic variables, including AIP, were identified by LASSO regression to construct a nomogram. Compared to the model minus AIP, the AUC of the nomogram displayed a non-significant improvement (0.749 vs. 0.788, p = 0.298). In contrast, the results of net reclassification improvement (0.306, 95% CI: 0.039-0.459, p < 0.001) and integrated discrimination improvement (0.049, 95% CI: 0.006-0.097, p = 0.020) demonstrated significant enhancements in the predictive ability of the model when AIP was added to the clinical model.

We aimed to develop a platform that integrates existing methylation data, systematically identifies DMRs and provides a tool for further investigation. We created a database combining Illumina HumanMethylation450K and EPIC data from normal colon, adenoma and adenocarcinoma tissues, comprising 2346 samples from 19 datasets. Methylation levels were analysed in six gene regions, and comparisons between tissue types were made using Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis and ROC tests. Both adenoma and adenocarcinoma samples exhibited a general decrease in methylation compared to healthy tissue. Differential methylation in genes such as ITGA4, NPY, IGFL1 and LRRC4 was validated. The strongest DMRs were observed in the C1orf70 gene's 5'UTR and TSS200 regions, with AUC values of 0.98 in both of the HM450K and EPIC datasets.

RP11-803D5.4 and AC005592.2 were identified as SE-lncRNAs of interest via microarray analysis, and our study aimed to evaluate their clinical value in CRC diagnosis and prognosis assessment. Fluorescence quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure the expression of RP11-803D5.4 and AC005592.2 in the tissues and serum of CRC patients. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were generated to determine the predictive value of the two SE-lncRNAs. Functional assays were applied to assess the ability of RP11-803D5.4 to promote the proliferation, migration, and invasion of CRC cells. The two SE-lncRNAs were significantly upregulated in CRC tissue and serum samples vs. corresponding controls. ROC curve analysis indicated that RP11-803D5.4 (AUC=0.842) and AC005592.2 (AUC=0.811) had a high diagnostic performance for CRC. The combination of RP11-803D5.4, AC005592.2, and CEA had an AUC of 0.946 and distinguished CRC patients and healthy controls better than SE-lncRNA alone. The serum levels of RP11-803D5.4 and AC005592.2 were strongly correlated with their tissue expression levels. The expression levels of the two SE-lncRNAs were significantly lower in postoperative samples than in preoperative samples. Furthermore, similar to the findings of previous studies on AC005592.2, high RP11-803D5.4 expression promoted the proliferation, invasion, and migration of CRC cells. The findings suggested that RP11-803D5.4 and AC005592.2 are upregulated in CRCact and are crucial promoters of CRC progression. They also suggested that they might serve as noninvasive biomarkers for diagnosing CRC.","2025","Current medicinal chemistry"

In a few cases, foreign body aspiration can lead to airway granulomas that interfere with tracheoscopic foreign body removal and threaten the life of the child. This study was a retrospective analysis of the clinical data of 184 pediatric patients who were admitted to Quanzhou Children's Hospital from 2018 to 2021 with exogenous tracheobronchial foreign bodies. Respiratory foreign bodies tend to occur during the winter and spring seasons. The solid foreign bodies were mostly nut foreign bodies, the location of implantation was the left lung rather than the right lung in many patients, and complications such as pulmonary atelectasis, emphysema, mediastinal and subcutaneous emphysema, and granulomatous tissue formation were noted in these patients. Statistical models suggested that the time of foreign body impaction and the release of oil were risk factors for tracheal granulation, with the logistic model presenting an AUC of 0.948, precision of 0.676, and sensitivity of 0.895, whereas the XGBoost model presented an AUC of 0.902, precision of 0.912, and sensitivity of 0.875. Tracheobronchial foreign bodies primarily develop in male children under the age of 3 and often lead to various complications. The time of foreign body insertion and the release of oil from the obstructed foreign body have been identified as high-risk factors for the development of tracheobronchial granulation tissue. When the time of foreign body insertion without oil release exceeds 99.98 h or when the time of foreign body insertion with oil release exceeds 47.94 h, tracheobronchial granulation formation strongly suggests that the child is at high risk of developing airway granulation. In such cases, family members must implement increased supervision of the child to prevent choking. Medical professionals should obtain a detailed medical history of the affected child and accordingly select the most appropriate method to promptly remove the foreign body to resolve the issue of airway obstruction and reduce the likelihood of pulmonary complications in the child.","2025","Italian journal of pediatrics"

Seminal clinicopathological series highlighted that a relevant number of patients alive-diagnosed with idiopathic PD have an alternative post-mortem diagnosis. We evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of PD comparing the in-vivo clinical diagnosis with the post-mortem diagnosis performed through the pathological examination in 2 groups. In this retrospective case-control study, patients and healthy subjects who consented to the post-mortem pathological diagnosis at the UK Brain Bank were consecutively enrolled from the UK Brain Bank. Medical records were reviewed to classify participants and performance metrics were further calculated using neuropathological diagnosis as the gold standard. Four thousand five hundred seventy one subjects were eligible for the study. The clinical diagnosis group was: 1,048 Parkinson's patients and 1,242 healthy subjects. Pathology diagnosis group were: 996 Parkinson's patients and 1,288 subjects with no post-mortem abnormality. For the group of clinical diagnosis, PD diagnosis showed: sensitivity of 99%, specificity of 86%, accuracy of 90.96%, F1-Score 0.89, and a receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (ROC AUC) 0.925 (SE ± 0.006) [95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.913, 0.937], 𝑝<0.001.

However, discrepancies between TS on preoperative images (TSi) and pathological specimens (TSp) have been reported. This study aims to evaluate the factors associated with the differences between TSi and TSp. We retrospectively analyzed patients with PDAC who underwent surgery at our institution between January 2010 and November 2023. TS discrepancy (TSD[%]) was defined as ([TSp - TSi]/TSp) × 100. Using logistic regression, we generated a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve to define the cutoff for TSi underestimation predicting clinical tumor (T) stage migration. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to evaluate predictors of TSi underestimation. Of the 231 patients, 99 (42%) patients received preoperative chemotherapy. The ROC curve determined a TSD underestimation cutoff of 25.9%. The number of TSp > TSi cases was 185 (80%), and TSi underestimation was present in 117 (51%) patients. T stage migration rates were 76%, 26%, and 50% in clinical stage (c) T1, cT2, cT3, respectively, among the patients with chemotherapy, and 93%, 33%, and 14%, respectively, in those without chemotherapy. Multivariate analyses revealed that independent predictors of TSi underestimation were posterior surface invasion in the patients with preoperative chemotherapy and anterior surface invasion in those without chemotherapy. TS was more commonly underestimated than overestimated, and cT1 rarely corresponded to pathological (p)T1. The factors contributing to TSi underestimation differed between patients with and without preoperative chemotherapy. Therefore, these two groups should be considered separately for accurate TSi evaluation.","2025","Annals of surgical oncology"

This study incorporates mouse-tracking (MT) into aIAT, which offers a more robust technique of memory detection. Participants were assigned to mock crime and then performed the aIAT with MT. Results showed that mouse metrics exhibited IAT effects that correlated with the IAT effect of RT and showed differences in autobiographical and irrelevant events while RT did not. Our findings suggest the validity of MT in offering measurement of the IAT effect. We also observed different patterns in mouse trajectories and velocity for autobiographical and irrelevant events. Lastly, utilizing MT metric, we identified that the Past Negative Score was positively correlated with IAT effect. Integrating the Past Negative Score and AUC into computational models improved the simulation results. Our model captured the ubiquitous implicit association between autobiographical events and the attribute True, and offered a mechanistic account for implicit bias. Across the traditional IAT and the MT results, we provide evidence that MT-aIAT can better capture the memory identification and with implications in crime detection.","2025","Behavior research methods"

This rate is significantly higher than that observed in adults. Currently, there is a lack of substantial evidence regarding the association between intraoperative blood pressure variability (BPV) during cardiac surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) and the development of AKI in pediatric patients. This retrospective observational study encompassed children aged 0-7 years undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Intraoperative BPV was calculated using coefficients of variation (CVs) and the area under the curve (AUC). Univariate and multivariate analyses were employed to identify risk factors associated with CSA-AKI. Among 570 patients (median age 1 year) reviewed, 36.1% developed CSA-AKI (68.9% risk stage, 22.8% injury stage, and 8.3% failure stage).

A retrospective analysis was conducted on data from PTC patients who underwent thyroidectomy between October 2022 and May 2024 across six centers. Based on lymph node dissection outcomes, patients were categorized into high-risk and low-risk groups. Initially, a clinical predictive model was established based on the maximum diameter of the thyroid nodules. Radiomics features were extracted from preoperative two-dimensional ultrasound images, and pathomics features were extracted from 400x magnification H&E-stained tumor cell images from FNAC. The most predictive radiomics and pathomics features were identified through univariate analysis, Pearson correlation analysis and LASSO algorithm. The most valuable radiopathomics features were then selected by combining these predictive features. Finally, machine learning with the XGBoost algorithm was employed to construct radiomics, pathomics, and radiopathomics models. The performance of the models was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), decision curve analysis, accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value. A total of 688 PTC patients were included, with 344 classified as intermediate/high-risk and 344 as low-risk.

Previously, we have reported that ingestion of highly glycated milk protein attenuates the postprandial rise in plasma lysine concentrations compared with the ingestion of an equivalent amount of milk protein with a low glycation concentration. Whether the attenuated increase in plasma lysine availability is attributed to compromised protein digestion and subsequent lysine absorption remains to be established. The present study combined stable-isotope methodology with the ingestion of specifically produced, intrinsically labeled protein to assess protein digestion and amino acid absorption following ingestion of milk protein with a high compared with low glycation concentration in vivo in humans. Fifteen recreationally active, healthy young males participated in this double-blinded, randomized cross-over study. Subjects ingested 40 g intrinsically L-[1-13C]-lysine-labeled milk protein with either a low (3%) or high (50%) glycation concentration. Continuous intravenous infusion of L-[4,4,5,5-2H4]-lysine was combined with frequent blood sample collection during a 6-h postprandial period to evaluate dietary protein-derived lysine release into the circulation. Postprandial plasma lysine concentrations were lower following the ingestion of milk protein with a high than with low glycation concentration (time × treatment effect: P = 0.002; ƞ2 = 0.214), resulting in a 23 mmol/L×360/min (95% confidence interval [CI]: 13, 32) lower incremental area under the curve (0 ± 12 compared with 23 ± 11 mmol/L×360/min, respectively, P < 0.001). The postprandial release of milk protein-derived lysine into the circulation was attenuated following ingestion of the protein with the high compared with low glycation concentration (time × treatment effect: P < 0.001; ƞ2 = 0.640) and was 31% (95% CI: 26, 36) lower over the full 6-h postprandial period (18 ± 4 compared with 49 ± 10% of the ingested lysine, respectively, P < 0.001). A high concentration of milk protein glycation strongly reduces postprandial plasma lysine availability in vivo in humans.

Data were retrospectively collected from 163 knees that underwent OWHTO between March 2014 and December 2019. Each data was assessed at three time points: preoperatively, at 3 months postoperatively, and the final follow-up. Constitutional alignment was also evaluated. Machine learning models were developed using two independent feature sets consisting of serial radiologic parameters and CPAK phenotypes. The area under the curve (AUC) was used as a primary metric to determine the best model. To evaluate the feature importance, Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis was also performed on the best model. Multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was the best prediction model, with the highest AUC of 0.867 based on radiologic parameters and 0.783 based on CPAK phenotypes. Joint line obliquity (JLO) at 3 months postoperatively was the most important factor among the radiologic parameters for predicting the final CPAK phenotypes. The features of constitutional and preoperative alignments also contributed, although the features of alignments at 3 months postoperatively were the highest contributing predictors. In conclusion, the developed machine learning models of the MLP showed excellent performance in predicting the final CPAK phenotypes after OWHTO. Postoperative JLO was the most important radiologic parameter for predicting the final alignment. The combination of features of the constitutional, preoperative, and postoperative periods enabled high accuracy and performance in predicting the final alignment.

Multi-strategy feature selection and advanced ensemble resampling approaches were integrated to enhance prediction accuracy and overcome data imbalance. The optimized Easy Ensemble Classifier achieved robust performance in both 10-fold cross-validation (AUC value of 0.8836 and accuracy of 82.81 %) and external validation (AUC value of 0.8930 and accuracy of 85.00 %). Paired case studies of hydralazine/phthalazine and procainamide/N-acetylprocainamide demonstrated the model's capacity to discriminate between structurally similar compounds with distinct immunogenic potentials. Mechanistic interpretation through SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) analysis revealed critical physicochemical determinants of DIA, including molecular lipophilicity, partial charge distribution, electronic states, polarizability, and topological features. These molecular signatures were mechanistically linked to key processes in DIA pathogenesis, such as membrane permeability and tissue distribution, metabolic bioactivation susceptibility, immune protein recognition and binding specificity. SHAP dependence plots analysis identified specific threshold values for key molecular features, providing novel insights into structure-toxicity relationships in DIA. To facilitate practical application, we developed an open-access web platform enabling batch prediction with real-time visualization of molecular feature contributions through SHAP waterfall plots.

329,"39869819","An Artificial Intelligence Model Using Diffusion Basis Spectrum Imaging Metrics Accurately Predicts Clinically Significant Prostate Cancer.","Conventional prostate magnetic resonance imaging has limited accuracy for clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa). We performed diffusion basis spectrum imaging (DBSI) before biopsy and applied artificial intelligence models to these DBSI metrics to predict csPCa. Between February 2020 and March 2024, 241 patients underwent prostate MRI that included conventional and DBSI-specific sequences before prostate biopsy. We used artificial intelligence models with DBSI metrics as input classifiers and the biopsy pathology as the ground truth. The DBSI-based model was compared with available biomarkers (PSA, PSA density [PSAD], and Prostate Imaging Reporting and Data System [PI-RADS]) for risk discrimination of csPCa defined as Gleason score > 7. The DBSI-based model was an independent predictor of csPCa (OR 2.04, 95%CI 1.52-2.73, P < .01), as were PSAD (OR 2.02, 95%CI 1.21-3.35, P = .01) and PI-RADS classification (OR 4.00, 95%CI 1.37-11.6 for PI-RADS 3, P = .01; OR 9.67, 95%CI 2.89-32.7, for PI-RADS 4-5, P < .01), adjusting for age, family history, and race. Within our data set, the DBSI-based model alone performed similarly to PSAD + PI-RADS (AUC 0.863 vs 0.859, P = .89), while the combination of the DBSI-based model + PI-RADS had the highest risk discrimination for csPCa (AUC 0.894, P < .01). A clinical strategy using the DBSI-based model for patients with PI-RADS 1-3 could have reduced biopsies by 27% while missing 2% of csPCa (compared with biopsy for all). Our DBSI-based artificial intelligence model accurately predicted csPCa on biopsy and can be combined with PI-RADS to potentially reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies.","2025","The Journal of urology"

This study aimed to develop a method for improved prediction of hip fracture by incorporating measurements of bone microstructure and composition derived from high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HR-pQCT). In a prospective cohort study of 3028 community-dwelling women aged 75 to 80, all participants answered questionnaires and underwent baseline examinations of anthropometrics and bone by dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and HR-pQCT. Medical records, a regional x-ray archive, and registers were used to identify incident fractures and death. Prediction models for hip, major osteoporotic fracture (MOF), and any fracture were developed using Cox proportional hazards regression and machine learning algorithms (neural network, random forest, ensemble, and XGBoost). In the 2856 (94.3%) women with complete HR-pQCT data at 2 tibia sites (distal and ultra-distal), the median follow-up period was 8.0 years, and 217 hip, 746 MOF, and 1008 any type of incident fracture occurred. In Cox regression models adjusted for age, BMI, clinical risk factors (CRF), and femoral neck bone mineral density (FN BMD) the strongest predictors of hip fracture were tibia total volumetric BMD and cortical thickness. The performance of the Cox regression-based prediction models for hip fracture was significantly improved by HR-pQCT (time-dependent AUC; area under receiver operating characteristic curve at 5 years of follow-up 0.75 [0.64-0.85]), compared to a reference model including CRFs and FN BMD (AUC = 0.71 [0.58-0.81], p<.001) and a FRAX risk score model (AUC = 0.70 [0.60-0.80], p<.001). The Cox regression model for hip fracture had a significantly higher accuracy than the neural network-based model, the best-performing machine learning algorithm, at clinically relevant sensitivity levels. We conclude that the addition of HR-pQCT parameters improves the prediction of hip fractures in a cohort of older Swedish women.","2025","Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research"

The median onset age was 30 (interquartile range [IQR] 18-54) months, with onset ages ranging from 3 to 164 months. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and logistic regression analyses were performed to identify the independent predictors of consciousness recovery at 1 year after brain injury. Discrimination and calibration were assessed using 1000 bootstrap resamples. The potential predictors of resultant living independence were also explored. The predictors for consciousness recovery at 1-year postinjury were: traumatic brain injury (odds ratio [OR]: 3.26, 95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 1.21-9.46), electroencephalogram (EEG) grade IV or below based on Young's classification (OR: 3.41, 95% CI: 1.38-8.70), and no bilateral impairments in the basal ganglia (OR: 3.75, 95% CI: 1.50-9.91) or posterior cingulate (OR: 5.61, 95% CI: 2.20-15.54). A nomogram was constructed with the area under the curve of 0.845 (95% CI: 0.780-0.911). Additionally, EEG grade IV or below, and the absence of bilateral impairments in the frontal lobes and occipital lobes were associated with favorable functional outcomes. These findings underscore the importance of comprehensive early-stage assessments in evaluating consciousness and function, assisting clinicians and families in making clinical decisions.","2025","Developmental medicine and child neurology"

To compare treatment and vancomycin-associated acute kidney injury (AKI) costs between Bayesian AUC-based dosing and conventional therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) using steady-state plasma concentrations of vancomycin administered as continuous infusion in hospitalized non-critically ill patients with severe Gram-positive infection. A cost-benefit analysis presented as a return on investment (ROI) analysis from a hospital perspective was conducted using a decision tree model (TDM versus AUC-based dosing) to simulate treatment cost (personnel, serum sampling and drug cost), vancomycin-associated AKI risk and cost up to 14 days. ROI was calculated against AUC-based software cost. One-way and probabilistic sensitivity analyses (respectively OWSA and PSA) were performed to check for robustness. In base case, an overall cost per patient of €621.0 with TDM and €543.6 with AUC-based dosing resulted in a treatment saving of €77.4 per patient when applying AUC-based dosing. This saving against the software cost (€26.9/patient) generated an ROI per patient of €1.9 per invested € in software [€1.9 (95% CI 1.6-2.2) in PSA]. Enrolling 900 AUC-based dosed patients annually translated to a net saving of €45 469. Software break-even was reached after 313 patients. In OWSA, a higher AKI risk with TDM strongly contributed to a positive ROI. AUC-based dosing appeared a cost-saving strategy compared with conventional TDM when applying base-case settings of vancomycin-associated AKI risk, treatment and AKI costs.","2025","The Journal of antimicrobial chemotherapy"

To undertake analytical validation of a sensorimotor cortical biomarker signature for pain consisting of 2 measures: sensorimotor peak alpha frequency (PAF) and corticomotor excitability (CME). This cohort study at a single center (Neuroscience Research Australia) recruited participants from November 2020 to October 2022 through notices placed online and at universities across Australia. Participants were healthy adults aged 18 to 44 years with no history of chronic pain or a neurological or psychiatric condition. Participants experienced a model of prolonged temporomandibular pain with outcomes collected over 30 days. Electroencephalography to assess PAF and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) to assess CME were recorded on days 0, 2, and 5. Pain was assessed twice daily from days 1 through 30. Participants received an injection of nerve growth factor (NGF) to the right masseter muscle on days 0 and 2 to induce prolonged temporomandibular pain lasting up to 4 weeks. The predictive accuracy of the PAF/CME biomarker signature was determined using a nested control-test scheme: machine learning models were run on a training set (n = 100), where PAF and CME were predictors and pain sensitivity was the outcome. The winning classifier was assessed on a test set (n = 50) comparing the predicted pain labels against the true labels. Among the final sample of 150 participants, 66 were female and 84 were male; the mean (SD) age was 25.1 (6.2) years. The winning classifier was logistic regression, with an outstanding area under the curve (AUC = 1.00). The locked model assessed on the test set had excellent performance (AUC = 0.88; 95% CI, 0.78-0.99). Results were reproduced across a range of methodological parameters. Moreover, inclusion of sex and pain catastrophizing as covariates did not improve model performance, suggesting the model including biomarkers only was more robust. PAF and CME biomarkers showed good to excellent test-retest reliability. This study provides evidence for a sensorimotor cortical biomarker signature for pain sensitivity. The combination of accuracy, reproducibility, and reliability suggests the PAF/CME biomarker signature has substantial potential for clinical translation, including predicting the transition from acute to chronic pain.","2025","JAMA neurology"

Tissue resident microbiomes are known to influence the immune status in other organs, but such a nexus has not been described in ocular conditions. Therefore, we examined the ocular surface microbiome of patients with KC and correlated it to the immune cell and tear molecular factor profiles. Sixty-two patients with KC and 21 healthy controls underwent corneal topography analysis and eye examination followed by a collection of Schirmer's strip, ocular surface wash, and ocular surface swabs. Microbiomes were analyzed by extracting DNA from the swabs followed by 16S rRNA gene V3-V4 amplicon sequencing and analyzed using QIIME. Fifty-two molecular factors from Schirmer's strip tear extracts and 11 immune cells from ocular wash were measured using multiplex ELISA and flow cytometry. Alpha diversity, linear discriminant analysis effect size (LEfSe), relative abundance and receiver operating characteristic - area under the curve (ROC-AUC) analysis were performed. Unsupervised clustering at the genus level with clinical parameters, soluble factors, and immune cells was performed. Fifty-two phyla/class, 132 order, 283 family, and 718 genera were identified in our cohort. Alpha diversity indices were comparable between patients with KC and the healthy controls. Dominant phyla across groups were Actinobacteria, Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Bacteroidetes. Alphaproteobacteria increased in KC eyes whereas Actinobacteria, Firmicutes_Bacilli reduced compared with the healthy controls. We found a significant positive correlation of Microbacterium, Cutibacterium, and Brevundimonas genera abundance with keratometry and corneal thickness. Levels of IL-21, IL-9, Fractalkine, and VEGF positively correlated with Tetrasphaera (P < 0.05). β2-microglobulin and CD66bhigh cells correlated with Bacteroides (P < 0.05). CD45+ cells correlated with Escherichia_Shigella (P < 0.02). We discovered a unique microbiome signature of KC which correlated to disease grades and secreted molecular factors and immune cells. Therefore, the altered microbiome on the ocular surface may drive immune dysregulation in KC and provide scope for potential interventions in the future.","2025","Investigative ophthalmology & visual science"

Patients who underwent DMEK at Gangnam Severance Hospital between 2017 and 2024 were included in the study. Four machine learning models-XGBoost, random forest, CatBoost, and logistic regression-were trained to assess feature importance and develop a predictive classifier. An ensemble of these four models was used as the final predictive model. The ensemble model identified clinically significant patients for prediction or exclusion. A total of 106 eyes from patients who underwent DMEK were analyzed, with 31 eyes (29.2%) experiencing post-DMEK OHT. The final ensemble model achieved clinically significant classification for 61 eyes (57.5%) in the total patient population. Significant risk factors identified in all four models included angle recess area (ARA), best-corrected visual acuity, donor graft size, angle-to-angle distance, crystalline lens rise, and central corneal thickness. The average accuracy, precision, recall, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and area under the precision-recall curve values of the ensemble model obtained by a 5-fold cross-validation were 80.2%, 60.0%, 59.7%, 82.3%, and 68.0%, respectively. This study identified significant risk factors for post-DMEK OHT and highlighted the importance of ocular topographic measures in risk assessment.

Severe dysplasia and above (SDA) identified at screening or follow-up were defined as the outcome. We calculated the absolute risk in three steps: 1) constructing a relative risk model using logistic regression, 2) calculating the age-specific baseline hazard, and 3) adjusting for the competing risk of all-cause death excluding ESCC. Flexible incidence rate parameters were integrated into the model to ensure its relevance across diverse regions worldwide. A total of 295 SDAs were detected. The relative risk model consisted of old age, male gender, irregular meal pattern, preference for hot or hard food, BMI of less than 22 kg/m2, and ESCC family history. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.753 (95% CI: 0.749-0.757). The averaged 5-year and 10-year absolute risk were 0.53% and 1.30% among participants. Based on our model, we developed an online calculator incorporated flexible incidence rate parameters, demonstrating ideal risk stratification tailored to regions with varying disease burdens (https://pkugenetics.shinyapps.io/escc_risk_prediction/).

The final clinical diagnosis was considered the reference standard. The results were validated in a separate cohort. A total of 631 Dutch patients were evaluated for the current study, of which 73 (12%) had a final diagnosis of bacterial meningitis. For the differentiation of bacterial meningitis from all other disorders, diagnostic accuracy was high with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.98 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.96-1.00). With the proposed cutoff of 5.2 ng/ml, sensitivity was 97% with a specificity of 96%. In the population of patients with a CSF leukocyte count of 5-1,000/mm3, the AUC was 0.96 (95% CI 0.87-1.00), outperforming CSF leukocytes (AUC 0.88 [95% CI 0.79-0.97]).

To develop and validate artificial intelligence (AI) models using noncontrast MRI to identify primary sites of spinal metastases, aiming to enhance diagnostic efficiency. Retrospective. A total of 514 patients with pathologically confirmed spinal metastases (mean age, 59.3 ± 11.2 years; 294 males) were included, split into a development set (360) and a test set (154). Noncontrast sagittal MRI sequences (T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and fat-suppressed T2) were acquired using 1.5 T and 3 T scanners. Two models were evaluated for identifying primary sites of spinal metastases: the expert-derived features (EDF) model using radiologist-identified imaging features and a ResNet50-based deep learning (DL) model trained on noncontrast MRI. Performance was assessed using accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) for top-1, top-2, and top-3 indicators. Statistical analyses included Shapiro-Wilk, t tests, Mann-Whitney U test, and chi-squared tests. ROC-AUCs were compared via DeLong tests, with 95% confidence intervals from 1000 bootstrap replications and significance at P < 0.05. The EDF model outperformed the DL model in top-3 accuracy (0.88 vs. 0.69) and AUC (0.80 vs. 0.71). Subgroup analysis showed superior EDF performance for common sites like lung and kidney (e.g., kidney F1: 0.94 vs. 0.76), while the DL model had higher recall for rare sites like thyroid (0.80 vs. 0.20). SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis identified sex (SHAP: -0.57 to 0.68), age (-0.48 to 0.98), T1WI signal intensity (-0.29 to 0.72), and pathological fractures (-0.76 to 0.25) as key features. AI techniques using noncontrast MRI improve diagnostic efficiency for spinal metastases. The EDF model outperformed the DL model, showing greater clinical potential. Spinal metastases, or cancer spreading to the spine, are common in patients with advanced cancer, often requiring extensive tests to determine the original tumor site. Our study explored whether artificial intelligence could make this process faster and more accurate using noncontrast MRI scans. We tested two methods: one based on radiologists' expertise in identifying imaging features and another using a deep learning model trained to analyze MRI images. The expert-based method was more reliable, correctly identifying the tumor site in 88% of cases when considering the top three likely diagnoses.

Regression analysis identified severe CFA calcification (p = 0.004), CFA depth (p < 0.001), minimum CFA diameter (p < 0.001), CFA depth-to-diameter ratio ≥ 5.6 (p < 0.001), and sheath-to-femoral artery ratio (SFAR) (p < 0.001) as significant predictors of VC. ROC curves generated for the occurrence of VC, the AUC for the femoral artery depth-to-diameter ratio (0.720) was higher than the AUC for the SFAR and the depth of the femoral artery (0.636, 0.630). Complications related to vascular access sites continue to be a significant concern for patients undergoing TF-TAVR. The CFA depth-to-diameter ratio has demonstrated superior predictive performance for VC compared to SFAR as expressed in the literature.

A comparatively high cut-point of ⩾0.6% for ICU admission risk resulted in a negative predictive value (NPV) of 99.8% (specificity 97.8%) but positive predictive value (PPV) of 0.8% (sensitivity 9.1%). Models including delivery-related factors demonstrated superior discriminative performance. Our model for maternal ICU admission has an acceptable discriminative performance. The low frequency of ICU admission and resulting low PPV indicates that the model would be unlikely to be useful as a 'rule-in' test for pre-emptive consideration of ICU admission. Its potential for improving efficiency in screening as a 'rule-out' test remains uncertain.","2025","Journal of the Intensive Care Society"

This is a prospective, cross-sectional study. Circumpapillary retinal nerve fiber layer thickness (RNFLT) was measured using spectral domain OCT in 49 eyes from 26 patients (36 normal, 13 GS) in three circle diameters (3.5, 4.1, and 4.7 mm). PERG measurements (Magnitude [Mag], MagnitudeD [MagD], MagnitudeD/Magnitude [MagD/Mag] ratio) were used. Based on clinical examination, participants were classified as controls or GS. Independent t-test and areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were obtained to determine the diagnostic capability of PERG and OCT. Independent t-test revealed significant differences between controls and GS in age, sex, central corneal thickness (CCT), all PERG parameters, and global RNFLT (gRNFLT) in three circle diameters. All PERG parameters were correlated to all RNFLT sectors (r > 0.291; p < 0.041), except in the temporal and nasal sectors of the three circle scans. Spearman rho was highest in 3.5 and lowest in 4.7 mm circle scan. AUC demonstrated 3.5 mm gRNFLT had the highest diagnostic capability (AUC = 0.877), followed by 4.1 mm gRNFLT (AUC = 0.852), and 4.7 mm gRNFLT (AUC = 0.821). MagD showed the foremost diagnostic capability (AUC = 0.81), followed by Mag (AUC = 0.799) and MagD/Mag (AUC = 0.762). Global, superior, and inferior RNFLT in 3.5 and 4.1 mm diameters, and MagD performed best in discriminating GS from controls, suggesting that a larger scan of 4.1 mm may be equally useful in glaucoma diagnosis as the conventional 3.5 mm diameter. We recommend using PERG with OCT of 3.5 or 4.1 mm diameters for glaucoma suspect diagnosis.","2025","Clinical ophthalmology (Auckland, N.Z.)"

The NLCs were designed to enhance the solubility, stability, and bioavailability of aloperine, a compound with vasodilatory and anti-inflammatory properties. Through a series of experiments including single-factor experimentation, transmission electron microscopy, high-performance liquid chromatography, in vivo pharmacokinetics, and tissue distribution studies, we assessed the physicochemical properties, drug release profiles, and in vitro and in vivo performance of this novel nanocarrier. The prepared aloperine-loaded NLCs exhibited a milky white and translucent suspension appearance, presenting a quasi-spherical shape under a transmission electron microscope, with an average particle size of (509.48±30.04) nm and an entrapment efficiency of (64.18±1.14)%. The drug release profile demonstrated good sustained-release characteristics in vitro, and the formulation remained stable for up to 15 days when stored at 4°C. Compared to the aloperine solution group, the t1/2, AUC(0→t), AUC(0→∞), MRT(0→t), and clearance rate of the aloperine-loaded NLCs were 2.3, 2.96, 3.06, 3.03, and 0.22 times higher, respectively. This indicates that formulating aloperine into NLCs can prolong its circulation time in the body. Furthermore, the concentrations of aloperine in the lungs of the NLCs group were 1.79, 3.78, and 2.30 times higher than those in the solution group at three time points (0.25 h, 1.5 h, 4 h), suggesting that NLCs can increase the accumulation of aloperine in the lungs. Our findings suggest that NLCs loaded with aloperine could offer a promising strategy for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.","2025","International journal of nanomedicine"

To determine the factors associated with improvement in subjective knee function from 6 to 12 months after ACLR. Case-control study; Level of evidence, 3. A total of 91 patients undergoing primary unilateral ACLR were included. Subjective knee function was assessed using the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Form (IKDC-SKF) at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Isokinetic knee strength (quadriceps and hamstring) and Anterior Cruciate Ligament-Return to Sport After Injury (ACL-RSI) scale scores were also assessed. Patients were included in the poor recovery group if their improvement in the IKDC-SKF score from 6 to 12 months was <15.5 points (minimal detectable change) and their IKDC-SKF score at 12 months was <90 points (maximum, 100 points). The IKDC-SKF score, knee strength, and the ACL-RSI score were compared between the poor recovery and good recovery groups with and without propensity score matching. Matched variables included age, sex, and IKDC-SKF score at 6 months after ACLR. In addition, logistic regression analysis was performed to identify factors that discriminated between the poor recovery and good recovery groups. There were 32 participants (35%) allocated to the poor recovery group. Before propensity score matching, the poor recovery group had a significantly older age, lower IKDC-SKF scores at 6 and 12 months, and a lower limb symmetry index (LSI) for quadriceps strength at 6 months. After propensity score matching, the LSI for quadriceps strength at 6 months was significantly different between the poor recovery and good recovery groups (73.0 ± 17.4 vs 83.3 ± 18.2, respectively; P = .039). Logistic regression analysis showed that a lower LSI for quadriceps strength at 6 months was significantly associated with poor recovery of the IKDC-SKF score (odds ratio, 0.96 [95% CI, 0.93-0.98]), and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis identified 80.9% as a cutoff value of the LSI for quadriceps strength with 75.0% sensitivity and 61.0% specificity. A lower LSI for quadriceps strength at 6 months postoperatively was associated with poor recovery of the IKDC-SKF score from 6 to 12 months after ACLR, even after adjusting for confounders.","2025","Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine"

Obesity, commonly assessed using body mass index (BMI), may have a protective effect on osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. As BMI is limited to the distinguishing fat accumulation, the study aimed to explore the association between allometric body shape indices [including a body shape index (ABSI), hip index, (HI), and waist-hip index (WHI)] and osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Postmenopausal women aged >50 years in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey from 2017 through 2020 (revised to 01/2017 through 12/2020) were included. Potential covariates were selected using the univariate logistic regression models. The association between allometric body shape indices and osteoporosis was explored using weighted univariate and multivariate logistic regression models, with results presented as odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The association was further explored in different age and BMI populations. Area under the curve (AUC) analysis was conducted to evaluate the predictive performance of WHI. In total, 810 postmenopausal women aged >50 years were included. Among them, 597 (73.70%) women have osteoporosis. WHI ≥0.094 (OR = 2.07, 95% CI: 1.14-3.78) was associated with higher odds of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (OR = 0.23, 95% CI: 0.11-0.50) was also related to decreased odds of osteoporosis. ABSI ≥85.74 was related to a higher incidence of osteoporosis in women aged ≥70 years (OR = 4.18, 95% CI: 1.22-14.35) and BMI ≥30 kg/m2 (OR = 4.25, 95% CI: 1.82-9.95). The WHI has a better predictive performance with an AUC of 0.656 (95% CI: 0.613-0.699) than the waist-hip ratio. Higher WHI was associated with an increased incidence of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women. Higher ABSI was related to a higher incidence of osteoporosis in women aged ≥70 years and those with a BMI ≥30 kg/m2. WHI could predict the incidence of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women.","2025","International journal of women's health"
348,"39866797","Improving Patient Outcomes in mTBI: The Role of Integrated Nursing Interventions in the Emergency Department.","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality, often requiring emergency department (ED) management. Integrated Nursing Interventions play a critical role in the care of TBI patients, but limited research has evaluated their efficacy in this setting. This study aims to assess the impact of Integrated Nursing Interventions on patient outcomes and complications in the ED. This retrospective study included 246 patients with mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) treated in the emergency department from January 2022 to December 2022. Of these, 138 patients received Integrated Nursing Interventions, while 108 did not. Baseline characteristics, clinical outcomes, and complications were compared between the two groups. Descriptive statistics, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used to evaluate the effect of nursing interventions on outcomes such as mortality, complications, and hospital stay. Among the 246 mTBI patients, those receiving Integrated Nursing Interventions (n=138, 56.1%) experienced significantly lower rates of adverse events, including perioperative intracranial hemorrhage (4.3% vs 12.0%, P=0.025) and shorter hospital stays (6±2 days vs 11±3 days, P<0.001). The study sample included 56.5% female, with 80.1% age ≤ 80. Integrated Nursing Interventions refer to coordinated care strategies that combine multiple nursing approaches tailored to address both physical and psychological needs of patients. For instance, the use of patient education combined with individualized pain management strategies. Logistic regression analysis revealed that Integrated Nursing Interventions were associated with a significant reduction in in-hospital mortality (OR=1.828, 95% CI: 1.619-2.318, P<0.001). ROC curve analysis demonstrated strong predictive accuracy for outcomes such as readmission rate (AUC=0.757), 30-day mortality (AUC=0.836), and 90-day mortality (AUC=0.760). Integrated Nursing Interventions in the emergency department significantly improve patient outcomes for mTBI patients, reducing mortality, complications, and length of hospital stay. These interventions, which include early assessment, timely intervention, patient education, and collaborative care, are essential for optimizing TBI management. The high predictive value of these interventions further underscores their importance in emergency care. Future research should focus on the long-term effects of Integrated Nursing Interventions on patient outcomes across different age groups, particularly in chronic disease management. Further studies could explore the role of digital health tools in enhancing integrated care.","2025","Therapeutics and clinical risk management"

Clinical data were retrospectively collected from 1,669 HIV-DM admitted to the Public Health Clinical Center of Chengdu from December 2018 to November 2023.Based on the occurrence of opportunistic infections, the patients were divided into two groups. Comparative analyses were conducted to assess nutritional status, plasma glucose levels, comorbidities of chronic noncommunicable diseases, and immune status. We applied univariate logistic regression and LASSO regression to screen independent variables. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors and establish a prediction model for opportunistic infections. In our study population of 1,669 patients (median age was 59 years, 83.22% male), 868 developed opportunistic infections, while the remaining 801 patients did not develop opportunistic infections. Additionally, 1,598 patients survived, and 71 patients died. The opportunistic infection group had a greater median age, lower median BMI, longer median length of hospital stay and greater number of deaths. Logistic regression analysis identified nutritional risk, duration of HIV infection, HbA1c, albumin, and CD4+ T cell counts as significant risk factors and predictors of opportunistic infections. Nutritional risk (OR=2.888) and HbA1c showed positive associations (P<0.001), while duration of HIV infection, albumin, and CD4+ T cell counts demonstrated negative associations with infection risk (P<0.05). The comprehensive model evaluation, based on receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA), validated the acceptable predictive performance of our model. This study identified nutritional risk, duration of HIV infection, HbA1c and albumin as significant risk factors and predictors of opportunistic infections in HIV-DM patients, further highlighting the importance of nutritional screening and good glucose control.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

The study reviewed 187 patients diagnosed with papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) concomitant with Hashimoto's thyroiditis from the First People's Hospital of Kunshan between March 2018 and December 2022. These patients underwent preoperative ultrasound and postoperative examinations. They were divided into two groups based on the size of their lymph nodes (LNs). A predictive model was developed using LASSO regression and multifactor logistic regression analysis. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to validate the predictive model. A total of 187 patients were randomized into 132 participants for training and 55 participants for external validation. Four predictors including tumor size, extrathyroidal extension, histological grade and vascularity, were selected from 13 variables based on LASSO regression analysis. In the training set, the model built from the above four predictor has a satisfactory predictive power, with an area under the ROC curve of 0.914, and validation set with the ROC curve of 0.889, which indicated that the nomogram can be used effectively in clinical settings. In summary, the nomogram constructed by tumor size, extrathyroidal extension, histological grade and vascularity, is useful for predicting the risk of HVLNMs in patients with papillary thyroid carcinoma associated with Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is expected to provide the basis for adequate and accurate management before the primary surgery.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

To explore the application effect of modified pediatric early warning score (PEWS) in the early identification of critically ill children in pediatric general wards. A single-blind, two-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted using a convenience sampling method. A study was conducted on 300 pediatric inpatients admitted to the pediatric ward of a tertiary hospital in Guangdong Province between June 2021 and December 2023. The patients were randomly divided into an observation group (150 cases) and a control group (150 cases) using a random number table. The control group received standard treatment based on medical orders, along with routine basic and specialized nursing care. The observation group received an intervention combining the PEWS with a graded nursing management model. The PEWS scores of the observation group were analyzed upon admission, and the value of PEWS in assessing the severity of illness was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The study also compared treatment outcomes, complication rates, mortality, and parental satisfaction between the two groups. The observation group showed significantly lower mortality, complication rates, length of hospital stay, and hospitalization costs compared to the control group (P < 0.05). Additionally, parental satisfaction in the observation group was significantly higher than in the control group (P < 0.05). When using the need for nursing intervention in critically ill patients as a predictive indicator, a modified PEWS score of ≥1 point was identified as the threshold for distinguishing critically ill patients who require nursing intervention. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.91, with a sensitivity of 92.1 %, a specificity of 75.4 %, and a Youden index of 0.675. As an effective tool for assessing patient conditions, the probability of receiving nursing care significantly increases for patients with a modified PEWS score above 1. The modified PEWS is valuable for early identification of illness and assessing changes in patient conditions. It enables timely recognition of deterioration and the provision of personalized nursing interventions, thereby reducing the incidence of complications in critically ill patients, preventing further deterioration, shortening hospital stays, and lowering hospitalization costs, ultimately improving parental satisfaction.

This retrospective study included children diagnosed with HSP and a control group from May 2020 to January 2024. Detailed demographic and laboratory data, including WBC count, lymphocyte count, neutrophil count, platelet count, hemoglobin, NLR, PLR, MPV, MPR, C-reactive protein, ESR, albumin, BUN, creatinine, sodium, potassium, calcium, IgA, PT, aPTT, and INR, were collected. GIS complications was classified based on clinical symptoms and diagnostic findings. Patients were categorized into groups without GIS complications, with mild GIS complications, and with severe GIS complications. We compared laboratory parameters across these groups to identify significant differences associated with GIS complications. Furthermore, a predictive model was developed by a Random Forest classifier to identify key markers and assess their ability to distinguish between patients with and without GIS complications. Significant differences were observed in several laboratory parameters between HSP patients and the control group, and between patients with and without GIS complications. Key predictive markers identified included neutrophil count, NLR, WBC count, PLR, and platelet count. The RandomForest model achieved an accuracy of 91% and an AUC of 0.90.

The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the optimal threshold for ACAG, and participants were divided into two categories based on this threshold. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. We employed univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses and Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival curves to assess the relationship between ACAG and the risk of in-hospital mortality. Moreover, subgroup analyses were conducted. A total of 2121 patients (54.7% male) were enrolled in the study. The in-hospital mortality rate was 18.9%. In patients with elevated ACAG levels, the in-hospital mortality rate was significantly higher than in those with lower ACAG levels (27.7% vs 11.3%, p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that even after mitigating for potential confounders, patients in the high ACAG group had significantly greater odds of in-hospital mortality across all models (Model I: OR = 3.000, 95% CI: 2.383-3.777, p < 0.001; Model II: OR = 3.021, 95% CI: 2.397-3.808, p < 0.001; Model III: OR = 1.916, 95% CI: 1.458-2.519, p < 0.001). Patients with elevated ACAG levels have more than twice the risk of in-hospital mortality compared to those with lower levels (hazard ratio (HR): 2.1277, 95% CI: 1.7490-2.5884). This study demonstrates that elevated ACAG levels are strongly associated with an increased risk of in-hospital mortality in critically ill COPD patients, suggesting that ACAG could serve as a potential predictor of adverse outcomes in this patient population.","2025","Therapeutic advances in respiratory disease"

Eighty-five elderly hypertensive patients with HFpEF were registered as the HFpEF group, and 46 hypertensive patients without HF were registered as the Non-HF group. The levels of serum sST2 (soluble ST2), Galectin-3, and NT-proBNP were measured, and related indexes of heart function were performed with echocardiography in two groups, respectively.The obtained variables were applied to statistical software for analysis. Age, BMI, SBP, DBP, TC, LDL-C, HCY, sST2, Galectin-3, NT- proBNP, LVEDD, IVSD, LVEF, and E/A were obviously different between the two groups (p < 0.05). The levels of sST2, Galectin- 3 and NT- proBNP in the HFpEF group were higher than in the Non-HF group (P < 0.05).

BMI, SBP, DBP, TC, LDL-C, FBG,UA, HCY, LVEDD, IVSD, LVEF, and E/A were significant differences in patients with different NYHA classes (P < 0.05). Spearman indicated that sST2, Galectin-3, and NT-proBNP were positively correlated with BMI, SDP, DBP, LDL-C, FBG, and HCY (P < 0.05). Logistic analysis indicated that BMI, SBP, DBP, FBG, HCY,sST2, Galectin-3, NT-proBNP, LVEDD, LVEF, and E/A were risk factors for hypertension with HFpEF. (P < 0.05). ROC indicated that the AUC of the diagnostic performance of sST2, Galectin-3, and NT-proBNP were all above 0.7, which may have some forecasting value for elderly hypertensive patients with HFpEF. The levels of sST2, Galectin-3, and NT-proBNP were closely related to cardiac function grades. sST2, Galectin-3, and NT-proBNP have similar diagnostic performance and predictive value for elderly hypertensive patients with HFpEF. sST2 was more sensitive than NT-proBNP.

This study provides an initial validation of a reliable span calculation from the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition Letter-Number Sequencing (LNS) subtest as a performance validity indicator for youth baseline testing (Reliable Letter-Number Span; RLNS). Method: Youth athletes (n = 173) underwent baseline concussion testing for the management of sport-related concussion. We classified participants as valid (n = 153) or invalid performance (n = 20) based on several well-established performance validity tests. We calculated RLNS by summing the spans of alphanumeric characters across two items within the Letter-Number Sequencing subtest, similar to the Reliable Digit Span. To better determine the utility of RLNS, we also examined other novel reliable span metrics and established summary scores from the Letter-Number Sequencing as potential validity indicators. Results: Analyses revealed excellent classification accuracy for RLNS, with an area under the curve of .88 (95% CI [.81, .96]). The optimal cutoff for RLNS (≤6) yielded .55 sensitivity and .95 specificity. Results showed similar but slightly lower classification accuracy statistics (areas under the curve of .77-.86) for the other LNS validity indicators. Conclusion: Initial findings support the criterion validity of RLNS as an embedded validity indicator. This measure is among the few extant performance validity tests that may be appropriate for youth baseline concussion testing. RLNS may also be appropriate for other types of pediatric evaluations. However, additional support is necessary before neuropsychologists can use RLNS clinically.","2025","The Clinical neuropsychologist"

[68Ga]Ga-PSMA-617 PET/CT scan of 116 eligible PCa patients (82 in the training cohort and 34 in the test cohort) who underwent radical prostatectomy with ePLND were analyzed in our study. The Med3D deep learning network was utilized to extract discriminative features from the entire prostate volume of interest on the PET/CT images. Subsequently, a multimodal model i.e., Multi kernel Support Vector Machine was constructed to combine the PET/CT deep learning features, quantitative PET and clinical parameters. The performance of the multimodal models was assessed using final histopathology as the reference standard, with evaluation metrics including area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, decision curve analysis, and compared with available nomograms and PET/CT visual evaluation result. Our multimodal model incorporated clinical information, maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), and PET/CT deep learning features. The AUC for predicting LNI was 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.81-0.97) for the final model. The proposed model demonstrated superior predictive accuracy in the test cohort compared to PET/CT visual evaluation result, the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) and the Briganti-2017 nomograms (AUC 0.85 [95% CI 0.69-1.00] vs. 0.80 [95% CI 0.64-0.95] vs. 0.79 [95% CI 0.61-0.97] and 0.69 [95% CI 0.50-0.88], respectively). The proposed model showed similar calibration and higher net benefit as compared to the traditional nomograms. Our multimodal deep learning model, which incorporates preoperative PSMA PET/CT imaging, shows enhanced predictive capabilities for LNI in clinically localized PCa compared to PSMA PET/CT visual evaluation result and existing nomograms like the MSKCC and Briganti-2017 nomograms. This model has the potential to reduce unnecessary ePLND procedures while minimizing the risk of missing cases of LNI.","2025","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging"

This study developed a 90-day mortality risk model using The Society of Thoracic Surgeons National Intermacs Database (STS Intermacs). STS Intermacs was queried for primary durable LVAD implants from January 2019 to September 2023. Multivariable logistic regression was used to derive a model based on preimplant risk factors by using derivation (2019-2021 implants) and validation (2022-2023 implants) cohorts. Model performance (derivation and validation cohorts) was assessed using C-statistics, Brier scores, and calibration plots. A refined model (all patients) was generated to calculate observed-to-expected (O/E; 95% CI) ratios for each center. The study population consisted of 11,342 patients from 2019 to 2023 who were sequentially divided in time into derivation (n = 6775) and validation (n = 4567) cohorts. Ninety-day mortality was 8.0% (9.2% in the derivation cohort vs 7.4% in the validation cohort; P = .001). Logistic regression applied to derivation and validation cohorts produced similar discrimination (area under the curve [AUC], 0.714 [95% CI, 0.69-0.74]; and AUC, 0.707; [95% CI, 0.67-0.72], respectively) and calibration (Brier score, .08 vs .07), with overestimation of risk among patients with a predicted risk >0.4. The O/E analysis identified 22 (12.5%) centers with worse than expected mortality with a 95% CI >1.0 and 14 centers (8.0%) with better than expected mortality with a 95% CI <1.0 (all P < .05). The STS Intermacs risk model demonstrated satisfactory discrimination and calibration.

362,"39864667","A new simple chronic heart failure prognostic index based on five general parameters.","Prognostic prediction in heart failure (HF) is challenging and no single marker has proven effective. We propose an index based on B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) and four widely available parameters. We retrospectively analyzed adult outpatients with chronic HF with systolic dysfunction followed from January 2012 to December 2020. The new proposed index was calculated based on 5 parameters measured at the index visit. BASIC index = (BNP*(age)2) / (serum sodium*hemoglobin*estimated glomerular filtration rate). Patients were followed-up until January 2023; the primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. A receiver operator curve was used to assess the association of the index with outcome; a cut-off was chosen based on the curve. We used a Cox-regression analysis to determine the prognostic value of the index. Adjustments were made considering established prognostic predictors. We studied 1065 patients. Mean age was 71 years, 65.8 % were male, 45.3 % had ischemic HF and 47.2 % had severe systolic dysfunction. During a 47-months median follow-up, 545 patients died (51.2 %). Median BASIC index: 11.7 (3.5-33.7). The area under the curve was 0.73 (0.70-0.76) vs 0.69 (0.66-0.72) for BNP, p < 0.001. The best cut-off value was 9.3; sensitivity = 71.4 %, specificity = 62.3 %, positive predictive value = 66.5 and negative predictive value = 67.5 %. Patients with a BASIC index above 9.3 had a multivariate-adjusted HR of all-cause mortality = 2.70 (2.20-3.22). The incorporation of age, hemoglobin, serum sodium, glomerular filtration rate and BNP in an index significantly improves prognostic prediction when compared to BNP alone. Patients with a BASIC index above 9.3 have an almost 3-fold higher death-risk.","2025","International journal of cardiology"

Traditional methods involve averaging the EEG signal of multiple trials to extract valuable neural signals from the high noise content of EEG data. However, this averaging technique may conceal relevant information. Our investigation focuses on determining whether a transformer-based deep learning approach, specifically utilizing attention maps, an essential component of transformer networks, can provide deeper insights into ERP data compared to traditional averaging-based analyses. We investigated the data of an experiment on loudness perception. In the study, 29 normal-hearing participants between 18 and 30 years were presented with acoustic stimuli at five different sound levels between 65 and 95 dB and provided their subjective loudness rating, which was categorized as ""too loud"" and ""not too loud"". During the sound presentation, EEG signals were recorded. A convolutional transformer was trained to categorize the EEG data into the two classes (""not too loud"" and ""too loud""). The classifier exhibited exceptional performance, achieving over 86 % accuracy and an Area under the Curve (AUC) of up to 0.95. Through the utilization of the trained networks, attention maps were generated. Those attention maps provided insights into the time windows relevant for classification within the EEG data. The attention maps above all showed a focus on the time window around 150 to 200 ms, where the average based analysis did not indicate relevant potentials. Employing these attention maps, we were able to gain new perspectives on the ERPs, discovering the attention maps potential as a tool for delving deeper into the analysis of event-related potentials.","2025","NeuroImage"

We searched for studies of multivariable models that were derived, validated, or augmented for prediction of AF in patients with a stroke, using MEDLINE and Embase from inception through September 20, 2024. Discrimination measures for tools with C statistic data from ≥3 cohorts were pooled by bayesian meta-analysis, with heterogeneity assessed through a 95% prediction interval. The risk of bias was assessed with the Prediction model Risk Of Bias Assessment tool (PROBAST). We included 75 studies with 58 prediction models; 66% had a high risk of bias. Fifteen multivariable models were eligible for meta-analysis. Three models showed excellent discrimination: SAFE (C statistic, 0.856; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.796-0.916), SURF (0.815; 95% CI, 0.728-0.893), and iPAB (0.888; 95% CI, 0.824-0.957). Excluding high-bias studies, only SAFE showed excellent discrimination (0.856; 95% CI 0.800-0.915). No model showed excellent discrimination when limited to external validation or studies with ≥100 AF events. No clinical impact studies were found. Three of the 58 identified multivariable prediction models for AF after stroke demonstrated excellent statistical performance on meta-analysis. However, prospective validation is required to understand the effectiveness of these models in clinical practice before they can be recommended for inclusion in clinical guidelines.","2025","Heart rhythm"

A variable loop circular catheter (VLCC, VARIPULSE, Biosense Webster, Inc) for PFA recently launched in Japan, includes a tissue proximity indication (TPI) feature to monitor catheter-tissue contact via impedance. However, the role of TPI during pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is unclear. This study aims to evaluate TPI feasibility during PVI and its relationship with acute pulmonary vein (PV) reconnection. Twenty-one patients with paroxysmal AF underwent PFA (at least 4 ablations per PV) using the VLCC. We evaluated the association between TPI-positive site percentages, voltage, left atrial wall thickness on ADAS 3D software (Adas3D Medical SL, Barcelona Spain), and acute PVI failure sites. Four of 21 patients (8 failure sites) experienced PVI failure after primary PFA. Failure sites had significantly lower TPI-positive site percentages (0 ± 0% vs 63 ± 27%, P < .001) and higher voltage (3.57 ± 1.35 mV vs 2.06 ± 1.42 mV, P = .003) but not PV wall thickness. We found that a left atrial bipolar voltage amplitude ≥2.24 mV was determinants of PV gaps with an area under the curve of 0.83 calculating receiver operating characteristic curves. TPI-positive site percentages increased significantly (58 ± 29% to 64 ± 26%, P = .009), whereas PV gaps decreased from 3 of 28 PVs (11%) to 2 of 54 PVs (4%, P = .332) between the first 7 and last 14 cases. Acute PVI failure was significantly associated with poor tissue contact and higher voltage.

We examined the Mass General Brigham (MGB) repository of clinical documentation from 12/1/1979 to 5/11/2021, using expert-curated keywords and ICD codes to identify a large cohort of potential AAV cases. Three labeled datasets (I, II, III) were created, each containing note sections. We trained and evaluated a range of machine learning and deep learning algorithms for note-level classification, using metrics like positive predictive value (PPV), sensitivity, F-score, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and area under the precision and recall curve (AUPRC). The hierarchical attention network (HAN) was further evaluated for its ability to classify AAV cases at the patient-level, compared with rule-based algorithms in 2000 randomly chosen samples. Datasets I, II, and III comprised 6000, 3008, and 7500 note sections, respectively. HAN achieved the highest AUROC in all three datasets, with scores of 0.983, 0.991, and 0.991. The deep learning approach also had among the highest PPVs across the three datasets (0.941, 0.954, and 0.800, respectively). In a test cohort of 2000 cases, the HAN model achieved a PPV of 0.262 and an estimated sensitivity of 0.975. Compared to the best rule-based algorithm, HAN identified six additional AAV cases, representing 13% of the total.

Currently, there are no reliable biomarkers to predict the recurrence and malignant transformation of VFL. Considering chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4 (CSPG4) as a biomarker for malignant tumors such as laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (LSCC), we conducted this cohort study to evaluate the prognostic influence of CSPG4 expression on VFL patients. This study included 44 patients with surgical intervention of VFL. CSPG4 expression in VFL were observed using immunohistochemistry, and the relationship between the prognosis of VFL patients and CSPG4 expression were investigated using Spearman correlation analysis and multiple Cox regression models. During a median follow-up of 89.3 months, recurrence occurred in 19 postsurgical VFL patients, and malignant transformation occurred in 10 patients. The recurrence and malignant transformation group showed significant differences in the H-SCORE of CSPG4 (P = 0.005 and P = 0.045) compared to the the non-recurrence group and the non-malignant transformation group. And the CSPG4 expression level was positive correlation with recurrence and malignant transformation (0.306 or 0.416, spearman correlation confident). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated that CSPG4 H-SCORE has predictive value for poor prognosis (areas under the curve, 0.742 and 0.710; cut-off points, 82.5 and 177.5, respectively). Multiple Cox regression analysis revealed a statistically significant effect of lesion size (P = 0.014) and CSPG4 H-SCORE (P = 0.005) on recurrence as well as pathological type (P = 0.001) and CSPG4 H-SCORE stratified by 177.5 (P = 0.039). Our survival data indicated that higher CSPG4 expression was associated with a shorter time of recurrence (P = 0.003) and tumorigenesis (P<0.001). CSPG4 overexpression indicates higher risks and shorter time of postoperative VFL recurrence and tumorigenesis. Detection of CSPG4 expression in VFL may be a novel approach to assess the outcome of VFL patients.","2025","European archives of oto-rhino-laryngology : official journal of the European Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (EUFOS) : affiliated with the German Society for Oto-Rhino-Laryngology - Head and Neck Surgery"

Systematic searches of electronic databases were conducted from 2000 to 2024. Primary outcomes were per-patient sensitivity and specificity of NC-MRPA and V/Q scintigraphy. The pooled sensitivities, specificities, and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) were calculated using a random-effect analysis. Summary receiver-operating characteristic (SROC) curves and the area under the curve (AUC) were obtained. A total of 3709 studies (1941 NC-MRPA studies) were identified through systematic searches, with eight published MRI and nine published V/Q investigations meeting inclusion criteria. The results showed that NC-MRPA had a pooled sensitivity of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.83-0.91) and specificity of 0.97 (95% CI: 0.93-0.98), yielding an AUC of 0.92 (95% CI: 0.85-0.96). V/Q scanning had a pooled sensitivity of 0.81 (95% CI: 0.76-0.85) and specificity of 0.84 (95% CI: 0.74-0.91), yielding an AUC of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.75-0.91). The pooled proportion of non-diagnostic tests for V/Q scans (34.7%, 95% CI: 30.8-38.7) was greater than that of NC-MRPA studies (3.31%, 95% CI: 1.65-4.97). This meta-analysis suggests that NC-MRPA is more specific than V/Q scintigraphy for the detection of PE, with comparable accuracy and sensitivity. NC-MRPA yielded fewer non-diagnostic scans than V/Q scintigraphy and is a feasible alternative imaging modality for diagnosing PE in patients for whom intravenous contrast administration poses a substantive risk. Question V/Q lung scintigraphy has been used as a reserve, alternative modality for patients who cannot undergo CT pulmonary angiography.

The complexity of EHR presents challenges in feature representation, information extraction, and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we proposed an efficient Aggregated naRrative Codified Health (ARCH) records analysis to generate a large-scale knowledge graph (KG) for a comprehensive set of EHR codified and narrative features. Using data from 12.5 million Veterans Affairs patients, ARCH first derives embedding vectors and generates similarities along with associated p-values to measure the strength of relatedness between clinical features with statistical certainty quantification. Next, ARCH performs a sparse embedding regression to remove indirect linkage between features to build a sparse KG. Finally, ARCH was validated on various clinical tasks, including detecting known relationships between entity pairs, predicting drug side effects, disease phenotyping, as well as sub-typing Alzheimer's disease patients. ARCH produces high-quality clinical embeddings and KG for over 60,000 codified and narrative EHR concepts. The KG and embeddings are visualized in the R-shiny powered web-API.3 ARCH achieved high accuracy in detecting EHR concept relationships, with AUCs of 0.926 (codified) and 0.861 (NLP) for similar EHR concepts, and 0.810 (codified) and 0.843 (NLP) for related pairs. It detected drug side effects with a 0.723 AUC, which improved to 0.826 after fine-tuning. Using both codified and NLP features, the detection power increased significantly. Compared to other methods, ARCH has superior accuracy and enhances weakly supervised phenotyping algorithms' performance. Notably, it successfully categorized Alzheimer's patients into two subgroups with varying mortality rates. The proposed ARCH algorithm generates large-scale high-quality semantic representations and knowledge graph for both codified and NLP EHR features, useful for a wide range of predictive modeling tasks.","2025","Journal of biomedical informatics"

We previously demonstrated that LV volume changes over the 100 ms of systole (LVEF100ms) can be used as a measure of LV systolic function. We sought to evaluate the applicability of LVEF100ms in patients with AF. We screened patients with AF who underwent prospective systolic electrocardiogram-triggered cardiac computed tomography from January 2015 to June 2023. The correlation between LVEF100ms and echocardiography-derived LVEF was assessed. Patients were categorized into 3 groups on the basis of echocardiographic LVEF (≤40%, 40%-55%, and ≥55%), and LVEF100ms was compared among these groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and Cox proportional hazards models were used to determine the optimal LVEF100ms cutoff for predicting LVEF ≤ 40% and major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE), defined as a composite of cardiac death, myocardial infarction, heart failure hospitalization, and stroke. Of the total 123 patients, 62 (50.4%) had an LVEF of ≥55%, 40 (32.5%) had an LVEF of 40%-50%, and 21 (17.1%) had an LVEF of ≤40%. LVEF100ms correlated with echocardiography-derived LVEF (P < .001) and differed significantly among groups (P < .001). LVEF100ms ≤ 3.3% predicted LVEF ≤ 40% (area under the curve 0.809; sensitivity 87%; specificity 67%). Patients with an LVEF100ms of ≤3.3% had a higher rate of MACE than did those without (P = .030), and LVEF100ms ≤ 3.3% was an independent predictor of MACE.

Despite the ample evidence, there is no consensus regarding the factors that may influence postoperative infections following surgical management of these fractures. This study aimed to investigate the risk factors for postoperative infections in patients undergoing surgical management for pilon fractures. This retrospective cohort study evaluated demographic variables, smoking status, nutritional status (i.e., pre-and postoperative albumin, pre-and postoperative white blood cell count, use of antibiotics, time to external fixation and ORIF, and hospital length of stay. A multivariate logistic regression model was used to predict risk factors associated with postoperative infection after fixation of a pilon fracture for several independent parameters. A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve was constructed, and a threshold was found for the investigated continuous variables, which were significant in the regression analysis. Overall, 416 patients following surgical management for a pilon fracture were identified. A multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that preoperative albumin, preoperative WBC, and hospital length of stay were associated with postoperative infection following surgical management of pilon fractures. Thresholds determined by the Youden index were 3.05 for preoperative albumin levels, 12.65 for preoperative WBC levels, and 7.1 days for hospital length of stay. Furthermore, older patients were less prone to develop postoperative infection than younger patients. Lower preoperative albumin levels (< 3.05 mg/dL), higher preoperative WBC levels (>12.65 mg/dL), and a longer duration of hospitalization (>7.1 days) were related to an increased risk for postoperative infection after fixation of a pilon fracture.","2025","The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons"

We compiled a dataset that included clinical features from 1065 patients and 3315 image datasets. Specifically, we selected data from 603 patients for training our multimodal model. The comprehensive experimental workflow involves identifying the optimal unimodal model, extracting unimodal features, fusing multimodal features, gaining insights from these fused features, and ultimately generating prediction results using a classifier. Our multimodal feature fusion model demonstrates outstanding performance, achieving an AUC of 0.994 (95 % CI: 0.988-0.999) and an F1 score of 0.971 on the primary multicenter dataset. In the evaluation on two independent testing cohorts (TCs), it maintains strong performance, with AUCs of 0.942 (95 % CI: 0.854-0.994) for TC1 and 0.945 (95 % CI: 0.857-1.000) for TC2, accompanied by corresponding F1 scores of 0.872 and 0.857, respectively. Notably, the decision curve analysis reveals that our model achieves higher accuracy within the threshold probability range of approximately [0.210, 0.890] (TC1) and [0.000, 0.850] (TC2) compared to alternative methods. This capability enhances its utility in clinical decision-making, providing substantial benefits.

The main controlling factors affecting seagrass potential distribution were analyzed, and the response of seagrass distribution to global change was clarified. Additionally, the current status of protected and disturbed seagrass meadows was determined. The results indicate the accuracy of the MaxEnt model was enhanced (AUC = 0.987) through the integration of a human activity index, pinpointing a highly suitable seagrass area of 867.64 km2. The primary factors dictating seagrass distribution were identified as human activities index (18.4 %), water quality indicators (including nitrate 20.9 %, silicate 11.3 %, and dissolved iron 6.4 %), and topographic elements (such as bathymetry 15.1 % and slope 12.0 %). The highly suitable areas for seagrasses showed a gradual expansion in the future, with a projected increase of 12 % in 2100 under the SSP585 scenario. A binary overlay analysis showed that only 2.61 % of seagrass potential habitats (highly and moderately suitable areas) were adequately protected, highlighting a significant conservation gap in the Yellow Sea and Bohai Sea regions. On the contrary, seagrass potential habitats exposed to mariculture activities were as much as 49.76 %. These findings underscore the urgent need for monitoring and protecting seagrasses in the study area, with the establishment of MPAs emerging as a viable conservation strategy. This research provides a scientific basis for understanding the degradation and conservation status of seagrass meadows and has important practical implications for targeted conservation and restoration efforts of these critical marine foundation species.","2025","The Science of the total environment"

POCUS clips were obtained from patients undergoing intraperitoneal insufflation for an elective laparoscopic procedure. Video clips of the right upper quadrant and epigastric regions were obtained prior to insufflation and then after 500 ml, 1000 ml, and 1500 ml of insufflation. These clips were randomized and reviewed by three blinded ultrasound-trained EPs. For each clip they determined whether pneumoperitoneum was present or not. EPs chose correctly 71 % of the time. Overall sensitivity for detecting pneumoperitoneum was 66 % with a specificity of 85 %. Sensitivity for detecting small, medium, and large volumes of air was 53 %, 70 %, and 73 % respectively. The AUC for pneumoperitoneum overall was 0.753. The AUC for detecting small, medium, and large volumes of air was 0.688, 0.773, and 0.789 respectively. There was substantial agreement between EPs with a kappa of 0.658. POCUS for pneumoperitoneum had moderate sensitivity, high specificity and moderate accuracy. The sensitivities increased with increasing volumes of air. This data suggests that POCUS has similar sensitivity to CXR for pneumoperitoneum.","2025","The American journal of emergency medicine"

This prospective study across 21 hospitals included 1714 consecutive patients aged ≥ 18 in their index hospitalization with COVID-19. The dataset was separated into training (80%) and test sets (20%). Eight supervised ML methods were used: LASSO, ridge, elastic net (EN), decision tree, support vector machine, random forest, AdaBoost and gradient boosting. A feature selection method was used to establish informative variables, which were considered in groups of 5/10/15/20/all. The final model was selected by balancing the optimal area under the curve (AUC) score with interpretability, through the number of included variables. The coefficients of the final models were used to build the AUS-COVID Score. Among the patients, 181 (10.6%) died in-hospital, 148 (8.6%) required intubation and 90 (5.3%) had adverse cardiovascular events. The LASSO model performed best for predicting in-hospital mortality (AUC 0.85) using five variables: age, respiratory rate, COVID-19 features on chest X-ray (CXR), troponin elevation, and COVID-19 vaccination (≥1 dose). The Elastic Net model performed best for predicting intubation (AUC 0.75) and adverse cardiovascular events (AUC 0.64), each with five variables. A user-friendly web-based application was built for clinician use at the bedside. The AUS-COVID Score is an accurate and practical, machine-learning-based risk score to predict in-hospital mortality, intubation, and adverse cardiovascular events in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.","2025","Journal of the American Medical Informatics Association : JAMIA"

From October 2021 to November 2022, this prospective study enrolled 225 participants with 233 breast cancers before treatment (NCT06104189 at clinicaltrials.gov). Tumor segmentation on MRI was performed independently by two readers (R1, dedicated breast radiologist; R2, radiology resident). We extracted 1618 radiomic features and four kinetic features from ultrafast and standard images, respectively. Logistic regression algorithms were adopted for prediction modeling, following feature selection by the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. The performance of predicting histological factors and subtypes was evaluated using the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). Performance differences between MRI methods and radiologists were assessed using the DeLong test. Ultrafast MRI outperformed standard MRI in predicting HER2 status (AUCs [95% CI] of ultrafast MRI vs standard MRI; 0.87 [0.83-0.91] vs 0.77 [0.64-0.90] for R1 and 0.88 [0.83-0.91] vs 0.77 [0.69-0.84] for R2) (all P < 0.05). Both ultrafast MRI and standard MRI showed comparable performance in predicting hormone receptors. Ultrafast MRI exhibited superior performance to standard MRI in classifying subtypes. The classification of the luminal subtype for both readers, the HER2-overexpressed subtype for R2, and the triple-negative subtype for R1 was significantly better with ultrafast MRI (P < 0.05). Ultrafast MRI-based radiomics holds promise as a noninvasive imaging biomarker for classifying hormone receptors, HER2 status, and molecular subtypes compared to standard MRI, regardless of radiologist experience.","2025","La Radiologia medica"

The traditional approach to develop these models involves the use of regression analysis. Machine learning algorithms are gaining in popularity as an alternative approach for prediction and classification problems. They can detect non-linear relationships between independent and dependent variables and incorporate many of them. In our work, we aimed to investigate the potential role of machine learning versus classical logistic regression for the preoperative risk assessment in proctological surgery. We used clinical data from a nationwide audit: the database consisted of 1510 patients affected by Goligher's grade III hemorrhoidal disease who underwent elective surgery. We collected anthropometric, clinical, and surgical data and we considered ten predictors to evaluate model-predictive performance. The clinical outcome was the complication rate evaluated at 30-day follow-up. Logistic regression and three machine learning techniques (Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, Extreme Gradient Boosting) were compared in terms of area under the curve, balanced accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. In our setting, machine learning and logistic regression models reached an equivalent predictive performance. Regarding the relative importance of the input features, all models agreed in identifying the most important factor. Combining and comparing statistical analysis and machine learning approaches in clinical field should be a common ambition, focused on improving and expanding interdisciplinary cooperation.","2025","Updates in surgery"

Furthermore, we aimed to compare clinical characteristics and long-term mortality among patients stratified by these proposed 1-min STST cut-offs. All patients performed the 1-min STST and 6MWT. Receiver operating characteristics analysis was performed to determine 1-min STST cut-offs corresponding to the 6MWT thresholds. Patients were stratified into three groups based on these cut-offs. Among 114 PH patients (mean age 66±14 years, 57% female), the mean number of 1-min STST repetitions was 17±6 and the mean 6MWT distance was 354±133m. The aligning 1-min STST cut-off for the <165m 6MWT threshold was 14 repetitions (sensitivity 69%, specificity 100%) with an AUC of 0.90 (95%-CI 0.84-0.97). For the >440m threshold, 20 repetitions (sensitivity 81%, specificity 84%) aligned with an AUC of 0.85 (95%-CI 0.75-0.94). Patients performing ≤14 repetitions had worse NT-proBNP levels (p<0.001), WHO-FC (p<0.001), mPAP (p=0.050), as well as health-related quality of life (HRQoL) (p<0.001) and a higher rate of mortality than those performing ≥20 repetitions (p=0.020). The 1-min STST cut-offs aligning with the 6MWT thresholds of 165m and 440m are 14 and 20 repetitions, respectively. Patients performing ≤14 repetitions demonstrated worse clinical parameters and higher mortality rates, making the 1-min STST a potential risk stratification tool in PH patients.","2025","European journal of preventive cardiology"
381,"39861708","Effect of Staggered vs. Simultaneous Co-Administration of Bempedoic Acid on Pharmacokinetics of Pravastatin: Randomized, Cross-Over Clinical Trial in Healthy Volunteers.","Background/Objectives: Bempedoic acid (BA) is a novel cholesterol-lowering agent with proven positive effects on cardiovascular endpoints. Because it is an inhibitor of the hepatic transporters OATP1B1 and OATP1B3, two uptake transporters regulating the intrahepatic availability of statins, it increases the systemic exposure of co-administered statins. This interaction could raise the risk of myopathy. We hypothesized that the drug interaction between BA and statins could be mitigated by staggered administration. Methods: This was a single-centre, open-label, randomized, two-arm, cross-over, phase I drug interaction trial in healthy volunteers (EudraCT-No: 2022-001096-13). The primary objective was to evaluate the OATP1B1 inhibitory effect of BA on exposure to pravastatin after simultaneous administration versus different schedules of staggered administration. A secondary objective was to evaluate the impact of SLCO1B1 genotypes (*1, *5, *15, *37) on pravastatin exposure. Pravastatin was administered in single oral doses of 40 mg at six visits. After a baseline visit with pravastatin alone, BA was dosed to steady state at the approved oral dose of 180 mg. Outcome measures were the area under the plasma concentration-time curve, extrapolated to infinity (AUC∞) and Cmax of pravastatin, 3α-hydroxy-pravastatin (pravastatin 3-iso), and pravastatin lactone, and their geometric mean ratios (GMRs) of different schedules of administration. Log-transformed AUC∞ and Cmax were compared with one-way ANOVA with a 90% confidence interval (CI). Results: Fourteen participants completed all visits. At BA steady state, the GMRs of pravastatin AUC∞ and Cmax were 1.80 (90% CI 1.31-2.46) and 1.95 (90% CI 1.40-2.72), respectively, compared to baseline. There was no significant difference in pravastatin exposure between simultaneous vs. staggered administration. There was no statistically significant difference in pravastatin 3-iso or pravastatin lactone between different administration modes. For the AUC∞ of pravastatin and pravastatin 3-iso, haplotype was a significant source of variation (63% and 20%, respectively), while the type of administration (simultaneous vs. staggered) had no significant impact. Conclusions: The increase in pravastatin exposure with concomitant intake of BA was larger than expected. There was no significant difference between simultaneous vs. staggered administration of pravastatin and BA, possibly due to a population that was heterogenous in SLCO1B1 haplotypes.","2025","Pharmaceutics"

A joint analysis of shear wave elastography, a radiofrequency echo-based wall tracking technique for arterial stiffness evaluation, and of autonomic and baroreflex function is proposed to noninvasively, preoperatively assess plaque vulnerability in asymptomatic CAS patients scheduled for carotid endarterectomy. Methods: Elastographic markers of arterial stiffness were derived preoperatively in 78 CAS patients (age: 74.2 + 7.7 years, 27 females). Autonomic and baroreflex markers were also assessed by means of an analysis of the beat-to-beat fluctuations in heart period and systolic arterial pressure, derived at rest in supine position (REST) and during active standing. Postoperative analysis identified 36 patients with vulnerable plaque (VULN) and 42 with stable plaque (STABLE). Results: Baroreflex sensitivity (BRS) at a respiratory rate decreased during STAND only in VULN patients, being much higher at REST compared to STABLE levels. Autonomic indexes were not helpful in separating experimental conditions and/or populations. The Young's modulus (YM) of the plaque was lower in the VULN group than in the STABLE one. Cardiovascular control and elastographic markers were significantly correlated only in VULN patients. A multivariate logistic regression model built combining YM and BRS at the respiratory rate improved the prediction of plaque vulnerability, reporting an area under the ROC curve of 0.694. Conclusions: Noninvasive techniques assessing shear wave elastography and baroreflex control could contribute to the early detection of plaque vulnerability in patients with asymptomatic CAS.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

This study considered all-comer patients who underwent cardiac surgery to build a predictive model for POAF. Methods: A total of 3467 (Center 1) consecutive patients were used as a derivation cohort to build the model. The POLARIS score was then derived proportionally from the odds ratios obtained following multivariable logistic regression (MLR). The Brier Score, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test were used to validate the model. Then, 2272 (Center 2) consecutive patients were used as an external validation cohort. Results: In the overall population (n = 5739), POAF occurred in 32.7% of patients. MLR performed in the derivation cohort showed that age, obesity, chronic renal failure, pulmonary hypertension, minimally invasive surgery, and aortic and mitral valve surgery were predictors of POAF. The derived POLARIS score was used to further stratify the population into four risk clusters: low (1.5-3), intermediate (3.5-5), high (5.5-7), and very high (7.5-9), each progressively showing an increase in POAF incidence. This was confirmed in a correlation analysis (Spearman's rho: 0.636). Conclusions: The POLARIS score is a simple-to-use tool to stratify patients at higher risk of POAF. Precise identification of such patients might be used to implement clinical practice with the introduction of preoperative antiarrhythmic prophylaxis, further reducing the incidence of POAF and, potentially, its clinical sequelae, despite further investigations being warranted to test this model in prospective studies.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

Sensory profiles during the acute back pain stage will predict central sensitization symptoms in the chronic pain stage, as central sensitization is the main mechanism behind nociplastic pain and pain chronicity. Therefore, our objective was to establish overall and sex-specific sensory profile cut-off points that distinguish symptoms of central sensitization at 12 weeks, using a retrospective prognostic cohort study design. Methods: Two hundred and seventeen patients with acute LBP (<6 weeks) were assessed using Receiver Operator Characteristic analyses. Measurements were taken at baseline using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile and follow-up by the Central Sensitization Inventory at 12 weeks, based on the established Central Sensitization Inventory cut-off points for the overall population at ≥30 and ≥40, female patients at ≥33, and male patients at ≥25. Results: In female patients, a Sensory Sensitive cut-off point of ≥30.5 significantly distinguished central sensitization symptoms at 12 weeks, resulting in the following values: Area Under the Curve = 0.81 (95% CI = 0.73; 0.89), sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.63, prevalence = 0.36, positive predictive value = 0.56, negative predictive value = 0.80, and Youden's index = 0.52. Conclusions: The Sensory Sensitive profile distinguishes female patients with acute LBP with and without central sensitization symptoms at 12 weeks.

The algorithm incorporates Red blood cell Distribution Width (RDW) data and other demographic characteristics to predict ICU mortality alongside existing ICU mortality scoring systems like Simplified Acute Physiology Score (SAPS). Methods: The developed algorithm, defined as a Mixed-effects logistic Random Forest for binary data (MixRFb), integrates a Random Forest (RF) classification with a mixed-effects model for binary outcomes, accounting for repeated measurement data. Performance comparisons were conducted with RF and the proposed MixRFb algorithms based solely on SAPS scoring, with additional evaluation using a descriptive receiver operating characteristic curve incorporating RDW's predictive mortality ability. Results: MixRFb, incorporating RDW and other covariates, outperforms the SAPS-based variant, achieving an area under the curve of 0.882 compared to 0.814. Age and RDW were identified as the most significant predictors of ICU mortality, as reported by the variable importance plot analysis. Conclusions: The MixRFb algorithm demonstrates superior efficacy in predicting in-hospital mortality and identifies age and RDW as primary predictors. Implementation of this algorithm could facilitate patient selection for clinical trials, thereby improving trial outcomes and strengthening ethical standards.

We investigated the association between frailty and intraoperative complications using multiple frailty assessment tools in older patients undergoing elective intermediate- to high-risk non-cardiac surgery. Methods: This retrospective cohort study included 637 older patients scheduled for elective non-cardiac surgery. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS), FRAIL scale, and modified Frailty Index-11 (mFI-11). The predictive ability of frailty tools was analyzed and compared using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results: Frailty was significantly associated with higher intraoperative complication rates (FRAIL scale: p = 0.01; mFI-11: p = 0.046). Patients considered frail using the mFI-11 were more likely to have unplanned intensive care unit admissions (p < 0.001). Those classified as frail by the FRAIL scale and mFI-11 had significantly higher rates of vasopressor/inotrope use (p = 0.001 and p = 0.005, respectively) and mechanical ventilation (p = 0.033 and p = 0.007, respectively). In the univariate analysis, frailty measured using the FRAIL scale was significantly associated with intraoperative complications (odds ratio [OR], 2.41; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.33-4.38; p = 0.004); this association was not significant in the multivariate analysis (adjusted OR, 1.69; 95% CI: 0.83-3.43; p = 0.148; AUC = 0.550). Atrial fibrillation, hemoglobin levels, anesthesia type, and surgical subspecialty were stronger predictors of intraoperative complications. Conclusions: Frailty assessments demonstrate the limited predictive ability for intraoperative complications. Specific comorbidities, surgical techniques, and anesthesia types play more critical roles. Comprehensive preoperative evaluations integrating frailty with broader risk stratification methods are necessary to enhance patient outcomes and ensure safety.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

This study evaluated LAR's role in predicting mortality and complications in isolated coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) patients. Methods: A retrospective analysis of 377 CABG patients (93 women, 24.7%; 284 men, 75.3%; mean age 65.9 years) from 2020 to 2024 was conducted. Data included demographics, preoperative characteristics, surgical details, and postoperative outcomes, along with ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS). Results: In-hospital mortality was 6.1% (n = 23). Independent predictors were low preoperative ejection fraction (EF) (OR: 0.96, p = 0.024), baseline LAR (OR: 1.08, p = 0.000), LOS-ICU (OR: 1.1, p = 0.000), postoperative ventricular tachycardia (OR: 37.9, p = 0.006), and acute renal failure (OR: 12.1, p = 0.000). Mortality cases had a higher median LAR than survivors (8.6 vs. 5.2, p = 0.000). Elevated LAR correlated with lower preoperative EF (r = -0.227, p = 0.000), longer LOS-ICU (r = 0.17, p = 0.001), and longer LOS-hospital (r = 0.208, p = 0.000). A LAR cut-off of 7.097 predicted mortality (AUC: 0.823, sensitivity 78.3%, specificity 77.1%). Elevated LAR values were observed in all groups with postoperative complications (p < 0.05), indicating its consistent association with negative outcomes. Conclusions: LAR is a valuable predictor of in-hospital mortality and postoperative complications in CABG patients. Elevated LAR is associated with longer ICU/hospital stays and poorer outcomes. Preoperative LAR assessment can guide risk stratification, forecast mortality, and inform surgical planning and treatment strategies.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

This study aims to assess the effectiveness of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven deep learning algorithms in predicting semen analysis parameters based on testicular ultrasonography images. Materials and Methods: This study included male patients aged 18-54 who sought evaluation for infertility at the Urology Outpatient Clinic of our hospital between February 2022 and April 2023. All patients underwent comprehensive assessments, including blood hormone profiling, semen analysis, and scrotal ultrasonography, with each procedure being performed by the same operator. Longitudinal-axis images of both testes were obtained and subsequently segmented. Based on the semen analysis results, the patients were categorized into groups according to sperm concentration, progressive motility, and morphology. Following the initial classification, each semen parameter was further subdivided into ""low"" and ""normal"" categories. The testicular images from both the right and left sides of all patients were organized into corresponding folders based on their associated laboratory parameters. Three distinct datasets were created from the segmented images, which were then augmented. The datasets were randomly partitioned into an 80% training set and a 20% test set. Finally, the images were classified using the VGG-16 deep learning architecture. Results: The area under the curve (AUC) values for the classification of sperm concentration (oligospermia versus normal), progressive motility (asthenozoospermia versus normal), and morphology (teratozoospermia versus normal) were 0.76, 0.89, and 0.86, respectively. Conclusions: In our study, we successfully predicted semen analysis parameters using data derived from testicular ultrasonography images through deep learning algorithms, representing an innovative application of artificial intelligence. Given the limited published research in this area, our study makes a significant contribution to the field and provides a foundation for future validation studies.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

However, in the long term, the primary patency of AVF is suboptimal, with an AVF failure of approximately 30% in one year. The aim of this study is to examine how the pre-operative baseline levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) affect long-term AVF failure. Methods: This retrospective, observational study involves ESKD patients admitted to the Vascular Surgery Clinic for AVF creation from January 2020 to December 2023. Ultimately, a total of 91 patients whose AVFs matured and began dialysis were enrolled. Prior to surgery, each patient underwent a thorough blood sample collection, with IL-6 levels assessed. The patients were categorized into two groups: those with functioning AVFs and those with dysfunctional AVFs. Their progress was monitored via a review of medical records, telephone interviews, or direct contact. Following the surgery, patients were observed for an average of 1.53 ± 0.94 years. Results: During the follow-up, patients who experienced AVF failure had a higher incidence of diabetes mellitus (p = 0.019) and active smoking (p = 0.012), as well as higher levels of IL-6 (p < 0.001). At ROC analysis, we found a strong association between IL-6 value and AVF failure (AUC: 0.814, p < 0.001), with an optimal cut-off value of 7.08 (76.5% Sensitivity and 79.7% Specificity). Furthermore, at the survival curve Kaplan-Meier analysis, we observed a higher occurrence of AVF failure in patients with baseline IL-6 values above the median (p = 0.004), in tertile 3 (p = 0.002), and above the optimal cut-off value (p < 0.001). At cox-regression analysis, elevated baseline IL-6 levels are associated with AVF Failure (HR: 2.23, p < 0.001). Conclusions: In the current study, we demonstrated that elevated IL-6 levels at baseline are associated with long-term AVF failure, independent of age, sex, and cardiovascular risk factors.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

Nevertheless, there is limited data on the effectiveness of hypothermic liver perfusion in evaluating organ quality. This study aimed to introduce a readily accessible real-time predictive biomarker measured in machine perfusate for post-transplant liver graft function. Methods: The study evaluated perfusate analytes over a 90-day postoperative period in 26 patients randomly assigned to receive a liver graft following dual hypothermic machine perfusion in a prospective randomized controlled trial. Machine perfusion was consistently conducted end-ischemically for at least 120 min, with real-time perfusate assessment at 30-min intervals. Graft functionality was assessed using established metrics, including Early Allograft Dysfunction (EAD). Results: Perfusate lactate concentration after 120 min of machine perfusion demonstrated significant predictive value for EAD (AUC ROC: 0.841, p = 0.009). Additionally, it correlated with post-transplant peak transaminase levels and extended hospital stays. Subgroup analysis revealed significantly higher lactate accumulation in livers with post-transplant EAD. Conclusions: Liver graft quality can be effectively assessed during hypothermic machine perfusion using simple perfusate lactate measurements. The reliability and accessibility of this evaluation support its potential integration into diverse transplant centers.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

This study focuses on the Korean adult population while providing insights that may be applicable to broader global contexts. Therefore, this study aimed to compare the predictive diagnostic capabilities of various anthropometric indicators, including body mass index (BMI), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), muscle mass-to-fat mass ratio (MFR), muscle mass-to-waist ratio (MWR), and body shape index (ABSI), in relation to MetS in Korean adults. Methods: Data from 13,725 participants of the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (2008-2011) were analyzed. The diagnostic power of each indicator was assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and the area under the curve (AUC) values were compared. Participants were classified into normal (NG) and abnormal (AG) groups based on established cutoff values, and logistic regression analysis was performed to evaluate the odds of MetS in each group. Results: WHtR showed the highest AUC values (0.792 for men and 0.768 for women), indicating superior diagnostic accuracy compared to the other indicators (p < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis indicated that both the unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (OR) for MetS were significantly higher in the AG than in the NG across all indicators (p < 0.001). Specifically, the adjusted OR (95% confidence interval) for WHtR in the AG was 6.793 (5.929-7.784) for men and 4.665 (4.151-5.423) for women, representing the highest values among all indicators (p < 0.001). Conclusion: Among the various anthropometric indicators, WHtR is the most reliable and practical for predicting MetS in Korean adults. It is useful for early intervention and prevention in both clinical and public health settings.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

Sometimes when there is a traumatic lumber puncture, the cerebrospinal fluid is bloody, which makes it difficult to diagnose. The objective of the study was to examine the performance of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) procalcitonin (PCT) and lactate as potential markers for the diagnosis of meningitis in neonates. Methods: 110 neonates who qualified for lumbar puncture were enrolled in the study. On the basis of CSF analysis, the neonates were classified into two groups: the meningitis group (n = 33) and the non-meningitis group (n = 77). PCT and lactate in CSF and established CSF parameters were recorded. Results: Median CSF PCT level was significantly higher in the meningitis group compared to non-meningitis: 0.93 (0.39-1.59) vs. 0.34 (0.195-0.74) ng/mL, p < 0.000001. Median CSF lactate level was significantly higher in the meningitis group compared to non-meningitis: 3.1 (2.27-3.96) vs. 1.78 (1.38-3.19) mmol/L, p < 0.001. At a cutoff of 0.35 ng/mL, CSF PCT had a sensitivity of 82% and specificity of 52% in the diagnosis of meningitis (AUC = 0.7). At a cutoff of 2.07 mmol/L, CSF lactate had a sensitivity of 84% and specificity of 60% in the diagnosis of meningitis (AUC = 0.701).

Severe hypocalcemia is a common complication of PTX and results in increased monitoring, interventions, lengths of stay, and costs of care. This study aimed to find the determinants and cutoff values of the biochemical determinants, if any, for severe post-operative hypocalcemia after PTX in adult patients with ESKD. Methods: Severe post-operative hypocalcemia was defined as a lowest adjusted serum calcium level < 2 mmol/L during a hospitalization stay following PTX. Receiver operating curves (ROCs) with area under the curve (AUC) values for pre-operative intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) and pre-operative alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels against hypocalcemia were used to determine cutoffs. Generalized linear models using Poisson regression with robust error variance were used to estimate the relative risk of severe post-operative hypocalcemia. Results: In total, 75 patients (38 women, 50.7%) with a mean age of 53.8 ± 11.4 years were enrolled; 43 (57%) patients developed severe hypocalcemia post-PTX and had higher pre-operative serum iPTH and ALP levels, as well as a significantly longer hospitalization post-operation (10.5 vs. 4.3 days, p =< 0.001). A pre-operative iPTH level of >166 pmol/L had an AUC-ROC of 0.73 and 72% sensitivity and 73% specificity, respectively, in predicting severe post-operative hypocalcemia with a relative risk of 2.00 [95% CI 1.27-3.33, p = 0.003]. Conclusions: A pre-operative iPTH level > 166 pmol/L is a strong risk predictor for post-operative severe hypocalcemia. Pre-emptive interventions in this high-risk group could potentially result in a reduced length of stay and lower acuity of care.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

However, most of these scores include variables that are dependent on medical staff examining the patient. We present the development of a real-time prediction model using clinical variables that are digital and automatically generated for the early detection of patients at risk of deterioration. Methods Routine monitoring data were used in this analysis. ICU patients with at least 24 h of vital sign recordings were included. Deterioration was defined as qSOFA ≥ 2. Model development and validation were performed internally by splitting the cohort into training and test datasets and validating the results on the test dataset. Five different models were trained, tested, and compared against each other. The models were an artificial neural network (ANN), a random forest (RF), a support vector machine (SVM), a linear discriminant analysis (LDA), and a logistic regression (LR). Results In total, 7156 ICU patients were screened for inclusion in the study, which resulted in models trained from a total of 28,348 longitudinal measurements. The artificial neural network showed a superior predictive performance for deterioration, with an area under the curve of 0.81 over 0.78 (RF), 0.78 (SVM), 0.77 (LDA), and 0.76 (LR), by using only four vital parameters. The sensitivity was higher than the specificity for the artificial neural network. Conclusions The artificial neural network, only using four automatically recorded vital signs, was best able to predict deterioration, 10 h before documentation in clinical records. This real-time prediction model has the potential to flag at-risk patients to the healthcare providers treating them, for closer monitoring and further investigation.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

Methods: We analyzed the records of 495 patients with single-segment osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (OVCFs) who were treated with single-entry PKP at our institution from March 2016 to August 2022. Univariate analysis, binary logistic regression, and ROC curve analysis were performed to determine potential risk factors, independent risk factors, and discrimination ability. Results: A total of 168 patients were included in the study, with a median follow-up duration of 7.00 months. In total, 143 patients did not experience vertebral refracture after surgery, while 25 patients did, including 22 augmented vertebral fractures and 3 adjacent vertebral compression refractures. The correction rate of the Cobb angle (p < 0.001; OR = 1.070) and postoperative anti-osteoporosis treatment (p = 0.002; OR = 0.021) were independently associated with augmented vertebral refracture. The ROC curves showed that these variables demonstrated satisfactory predictive values for augmented vertebral refracture. Conclusions: A high degree of restoration of the Cobb angle was the factor contributing to vertebral refracture after PKP. Conversely, postoperative anti-osteoporosis treatment was observed to be a protective factor against subsequent vertebral refracture.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

Hemodialysis patients are very fragile patients and the presence of CVCs increases the risk of sepsis. We conducted a prospective study, evaluating the needs of changes in vancomycin dosing for treatment based on the use of the new 2020 vancomycin dosing guidelines, to increase drug safety (preventing subtherapeutic or supratherapeutic doses and offering therapeutic concentrations of the drug) in a particular group of patients with sepsis caused by catheter infections and being on intermittent hemodialysis. Methods: This prospective study included patients with sepsis caused by catheter infections and being on intermittent hemodialysis, treated with vancomycin, admitted in the nephrology department and intensive care unit (ICU). Vancomycin levels were adjusted according to the 2020 vancomycin guidelines. Results: In our study, nine (45%) patients had a vancomycin AUC between 400 and 600 mcg × h/mL, five (25%) patients had a subtherapeutic AUC, and six (30%) patients had a supratherapeutic AUC. It is important to mention that in 10 (50%) of the patients included in the study, the loading and maintenance doses mentioned in the protocol were respected, but 50% of them had a supratherapeutic AUC. We observed that a supratherapeutic AUC occurred when the loading dose was 1500 mg or 2000 mg, and in one case at 1000 mg with a low BMI. Conclusions: a therapeutic level of vancomycin can often be difficult to achieve because of different reasons, mainly in hemodialysis patients.","2025","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)"

We evaluated the causative pathogens involved and their resistance to the major classes of antibiotics in patients with VAP and assessed the differences between patients with and without coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Materials and Methods: This study was a single-center, cross-sectional, retrospective analysis involving 122 patients who were hospitalized in the ICU of Târgu Mureș County Clinical Hospital from 1 April 2021, to 1 April 2023. This study compares patients with VAP in COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 groups, examining the clinical progression, duration of ventilation and hospitalization, mortality, pathogen distribution, and the emergence of multidrug-resistant strains. Results: A length of stay in the ICU exceeding 11.5 days was associated with the development of multidrug-resistant (MDR) infections (AUC: 0.708, p < 0.001). Similarly, a duration of MV exceeding 196 h was associated with MDR acquisition (AUC: 0.695, p = 0.002). Additionally, a Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) greater than 5 was associated with MDR development (AUC: 0.854, p < 0.001) in the whole group of patients. The most commonly isolated strains were Acinetobacter spp., Pseudomonas spp., Klebsiella spp., and Staphylococcus aureus. Among non-COVID-19 patients, there was a notably higher frequency of MDR Acinetobacter baumannii. A bacterial resistance to carbapenems was found in Acinetobacter spp. (51.6%), Klebsiella spp. (22.6%), and Pseudomonas spp. (25.8%). Conclusions: COVID-19 patients experienced longer ventilation, higher mortality, and an increased risk of developing MDR. Carbapenem resistance was universal in Acinetobacter spp. and Klebsiella pneumoniae, whereas resistance in Pseudomonas aeruginosa was more prevalent among non-COVID-19 patients. The Clinical Pulmonary Infection Score (CPIS) strongly correlates with developing MDR pathogens in both patient groups.","2025","Antibiotics (Basel, Switzerland)"

The aim of this study was to investigate the relationship between sperm motility and the seminal plasma lipid profile in Simmental bulls, and to identify key lipids potentially influencing sperm motility. Semen samples were collected from 26 healthy Simmental bulls with an average age of 4.9 years. Sperm quality was evaluated using computer-assisted sperm analysis (CASA). Based on motility, the samples were divided into two groups: high sperm motility (HSM > 65%) and low sperm motility (LSM < 65%). Compared to the LSM group, the HSM group exhibited significantly higher sperm viability, motility, straight-line velocity, beat-cross frequency, and sperm acrosome integrity, while the sperm malformation rate was lower (p < 0.05). Lipid profiles were determined using LC-MS/MS, and 40 differential lipids were identified by multivariate statistical analysis. Among them, 39 lipids were upregulated in the LSM group compared to the HSM group. They were primarily triglycerides and carnitines, mainly involved in four metabolic pathways related to glycerophospholipid and linoleic acid metabolism. Notably, PC (16:0/20:4; 14:0/18:3), LPC (22:4/0:0; 22:6/0:0), and PE (14:0/18:1; 18:1/20:3) were diagnosed with great accuracy (AUC > 0.7), which means they may serve as potential biomarkers for sperm motility.","2025","Animals : an open access journal from MDPI"

This study aimed to develop machine learning models to enhance MM staging accuracy and stratify asymptomatic patients by their risk of progression. We utilized gene expression microarray datasets to develop machine learning models, combined with various data transformations. For multiple myeloma staging, models were trained on a single dataset and validated across five independent datasets, with performance evaluated using multiclass area under the curve (AUC) metrics. To predict progression in asymptomatic patients, we employed two approaches: (1) training models on a dataset comprising asymptomatic patients who either progressed or remained stable without progressing to multiple myeloma, and (2) training models on multiple datasets combining asymptomatic and multiple myeloma samples and then testing their ability to distinguish between asymptomatic and asymptomatic that progressed. We performed feature selection and enrichment analyses to identify key signaling pathways underlying disease stages and progression. Multiple myeloma staging models demonstrated high efficacy, with ElasticNet achieving consistent multiclass AUC values of 0.9 across datasets and transformations, demonstrating robust generalizability. For asymptomatic progression, both modeling approaches yielded similar results, with AUC values exceeding 0.8 across datasets and algorithms (ElasticNet, Boosting, and Support Vector Machines), underscoring their potential in identifying progression risk. Enrichment analyses revealed key pathways, including PI3K-Akt, MAPK, Wnt, and mTOR, as central to MM pathogenesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to utilize gene expression datasets for classifying patients across different stages of multiple myeloma and to integrate multiple myeloma with asymptomatic cases to predict disease progression, offering a novel methodology with potential clinical applications in patient monitoring and early intervention.","2025","Cancers"

Advances in radiomics and machine learning applied to medical imaging offer promise for assessing thyroid nodules. This study utilized radiomics analysis on F-18 FDG PET/CT to improve preoperative differential diagnosis of TIs. A total of 152 patient cases were retrospectively analyzed and split into training and validation sets (7:3) using stratification and randomization. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm identified nine radiomics features from 960 candidates to construct a radiomics signature predictive of malignancy. Performance of the radiomics score was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and area under the curve (AUC). In the training set, the radiomics score achieved an AUC of 0.794 (95% CI: 0.703-0.885, p < 0.001). Validation was performed on internal and external datasets, yielding AUCs of 0.702 (95% CI: 0.547-0.858, p = 0.011) and 0.668 (95% CI: 0.500-0.838, p = 0.043), respectively.

These studies are usually based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and sometimes also on positron emission tomography (PET) images. To date, however, there are virtually no corresponding studies based on routinely generated computed tomography (CT) images. The aim of our proof-of-concept study is to investigate whether machine learning-based tumor diagnosis is also possible using CT images. We investigate the differentiability of histologically confirmed low-grade and high-grade gliomas. Three conventional machine learning algorithms and a neural net are tested. In addition, we analyze which of the common imaging methods (MRI or CT) appears to be best suited for the diagnostic question under investigation when machine learning algorithms are used. For this purpose, we compare our results based on CT images with numerous studies based on MRI scans. Our best-performing model includes six features and is obtained using univariate analysis for feature preselection and a Naive Bayes approach for model construction. Using independent test data, this model yields a mean AUC of 0.903, a mean accuracy of 0.839, a mean sensitivity of 0.807 and a mean specificity of 0.864. Our results demonstrate that low-grade and high-grade gliomas can be differentiated with high accuracy using machine learning algorithms, not only based on the usual MRI scans, but also based on CT images. In the future, such CT-image-based models can help to further accelerate brain tumor diagnostics and to reduce the number of necessary biopsies.","2025","Cancers"

We collected 199 LCa patients with both PET and CT images, obtained from TCIA and our local database, alongside 408 HNCa PET/CT images from TCIA. We extracted 215 HRFs and 1024 DRFs by PySERA and a 3D autoencoder, respectively, within the ViSERA 1.0.0 software, from segmented primary tumors. The supervised strategy (SL) employed an HMLS-PCA connected with six classifiers on both HRFs and DRFs. The SSL strategy expanded the datasets by adding 408 pseudo-labeled HNCa cases (labeled by the Random Forest algorithm) to 199 LCa cases, using the same HMLS techniques. Furthermore, principal component analysis (PCA) linked with four survival prediction algorithms were utilized in the survival hazard ratio analysis. The SSL strategy outperformed the SL method (p << 0.001), achieving an average accuracy of 0.85 ± 0.05 with DRFs from PET and PCA + Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), compared to 0.69 ± 0.06 for the SL strategy using DRFs from CT and PCA + Light Gradient Boosting (LGB). Additionally, PCA linked with Component-wise Gradient Boosting Survival Analysis on both HRFs and DRFs, as extracted from CT, had an average C-index of 0.80, with a log rank p-value << 0.001, confirmed by external testing. Shifting from HRFs and SL to DRFs and SSL strategies, particularly in contexts with limited data points, enabling CT or PET alone, can significantly achieve high predictive performance.","2025","Cancers"

This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic potential of iUS radiomics in glioblastoma patients in a multi-institutional cohort. This retrospective study included patients diagnosed with glioblastoma from the multicenter Brain Tumor Intraoperative (BraTioUS) database. A single 2D iUS slice, showing the largest tumor diameter, was selected for each patient. Radiomic features were extracted and subjected to feature selection, and clinical data were collected. Using a fivefold cross-validation strategy, Cox proportional hazards models were built using radiomic features alone, clinical data alone, and their combination. Model performance was assessed via the concordance index (C-index). A total of 114 patients met the inclusion criteria, with a mean age of 56.88 years, a median OS of 382 days, and a median preoperative tumor volume of 32.69 cm3. Complete tumor resection was achieved in 51.8% of the patients. In the testing cohort, the combined model achieved a mean C-index of 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76-0.98), outperforming the radiomic model (C-index: 0.72, 95% CI: 0.57-0.86) and the clinical model (C-index: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.60-0.87).

However, there are no well-defined criteria for selecting patients who may benefit from the test. The aim of this study was to develop a novel nomogram to estimate the probability of obtaining a high-risk EndoPredict® result in clinical practice. Methods: The study cohort comprised 348 cases of T1-3/N0-1a/M0 ER-positive/HER2-negative breast carcinoma. A multivariate analysis was conducted using a training cohort (n = 270) based on clinicopathological features that demonstrated a statistically significant correlation with the EndoPredict® result in a univariate analysis. The predictive model was subsequently represented as a nomogram to estimate the probability of obtaining a high-risk result in the EndoPredict® assay. The predictive model was then validated using a separate validation cohort (n = 78). Results: The clinicopathological features incorporated into the nomogram included tumor size, tumor grade, sentinel lymph node status, pN stage, and Ki67. The internal validation of the model yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.803 (95% CI = 0.751, 0.855) in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve for the training cohort, with an optimal sensitivity and specificity at a threshold of 0.536.

To address this gap, we developed a web application powered by a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm to assist in guiding initial TKI treatment decisions. Clinical and mutational data from advanced NSCLC patients were retrospectively collected from 14 medical centers. Only patients with complete data and sufficient follow-up were included. Multiple supervised machine learning models were tested, with the Extra Trees Classifier (ETC) identified as the most effective for predicting progression-free survival. Feature importance scores were calculated by the ETC, and features were then integrated into a Deep Q-Network (DQN) RL algorithm. The RL model was designed to select optimal TKI generation and a treatment line for each patient and was embedded into an open-source web application for experimental clinical use. In total, 318 cases of EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC were analyzed, with a median patient age of 63. A total of 52.2% of patients were female, and 83.3% had ECOG scores of 0 or 1. The top three most influential features identified were neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (log-transformed), age (log-transformed), and the treatment line of TKI administration, as tested by the ETC algorithm, with an area under curve (AUC) value of 0.73, whereas the DQN RL algorithm achieved a higher AUC value of 0.80, assigning distinct Q-values across four TKI treatment categories. This supports the decision-making process in the web-based 'EGFR Mutant NSCLC Treatment Advisory System', where clinicians can input patient-specific data to receive tailored recommendations. The RL-based web application shows promise in assisting TKI treatment selection for EGFR-mutant advanced NSCLC patients, underscoring the potential for reinforcement learning to enhance decision-making in oncology care.","2025","Cancers"

We aimed to identify predictive biomarkers in DCD grafts subjected to NRP, followed by randomization to either normothermic machine perfusion (NMP) or dual hypothermic oxygenated perfusion (D-HOPE). Methods: Among 57 DCD donors, 32 liver grafts were transplanted, and recipients were monitored for one week post-transplant. Biomarkers linked with oxidative stress, hepatic injury, mitochondrial dysfunction, inflammation, regeneration, and autophagy were measured during NRP, end-ischemic MP, and one week post-transplant. Results: Arginase-1 (ARG-1) levels were consistently higher in discarded grafts and in recipients who later developed early allograft dysfunction (EAD). Specifically, ARG-1 levels at the end of MP correlated with markers of hepatic injury. Receiver operating characteristic analysis indicated that ARG-1 at the end of MP had a good predictive accuracy for EAD (AUC = 0.713; p = 0.02). Lipid peroxidation (TBARS) elevated at the start of NRP, declined over time, with higher levels in D-HOPE than in NMP, suggesting a more oxidative environment in D-HOPE. Metabolites like flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and NADH exhibited significant disparities between perfusion types, due to differences in perfusate compositions. Inflammatory biomarkers rose during NRP and NMP but normalized post-transplantation.

This study evaluates the calcium-phosphorus product (Ca × P) to estimated glomerular filtration rate (Ca × P/eGFR) ratio as a potential biomarker for predicting CV risk in pre-dialysis CKD patients. Eighty-four CKD patients in stages G1-G4, according to the KDIGO criteria, were classified into CVD (n = 43) and non-CVD (n = 41) groups. Biochemical parameters, including serum creatinine (SCr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), calcium (Ca), inorganic phosphate (Pi), parathyroid hormone (PTH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), Ca × P, eGFR, and the Ca × P/eGFR ratio, were measured and calculated. Statistical analyses were performed to identify predictors of CV risk and evaluate the diagnostic reliability of the Ca × P/eGFR ratio for predicting the risk. Significant differences were observed in SCr, BUN, eGFR (p < 0.001), and the Ca × P/eGFR ratio (p = 0.007) between the groups. Regression analysis indicated the Ca × P/eGFR ratio as a significant CVD risk predictor (p = 0.012, OR = 1.206, 95% CI: 1.042-1.395). Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed an AUC of 0.751 (p < 0.001, 95% CI: 0.645-0.857), with a sensitivity and specificity of the method of 74.4% and 70.7%, respectively. Significant correlations were found between the Ca × P/eGFR ratio and SCr, BUN, UA, Ca, Pi, PTH, and ALP. The Ca × P/eGFR ratio may serve as a significant predictor of CVD risk in pre-dialysis CKD patients, suggesting that its integration into routine evaluations could enhance CV risk stratification and management.","2025","Biomedicines"

While clinical factors such as age and genetic mutations contribute to prognosis, recent studies suggest that CT attenuation scores may also predict treatment outcomes. This study aims to develop a nomogram combining clinical and CT-based factors to predict treatment response and guide personalized therapy for AML patients. Methods: This retrospective study included 74 newly diagnosed AML patients who underwent unenhanced abdominal CT scans within one week before receiving their first induction chemotherapy. Clinical biomarkers of tumor burden were also collected. Patients were classified into two groups based on treatment response: complete remission (CR; n = 24) and non-complete remission (NCR; n = 50). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent predictors of treatment response. Predictive performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and model consistency was assessed through calibration and decision curve analysis (DCA). Results: Significant differences in hemoglobin (Hb), platelets (Plt), and CT attenuation scores were observed between the CR and NCR groups (all p < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression identified Hb, Plt, and CT attenuation scores as independent predictors of treatment response. A nomogram incorporating these factors demonstrated excellent predictive performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.912 (95% CI: 0.842-0.983), accuracy of 0.865 (95% CI: 0.765-0.933), sensitivity of 0.880 (95% CI: 0.790-0.970), and specificity of 0.833 (95% CI: 0.684-0.982). The CR nomogram displayed significant clinical value and excellent goodness of fit. Conclusions: The nomogram, which incorporates Hb, Plt, and CT attenuation scores, provides valuable insights into predicting treatment response in AML patients. This model offers strong discriminatory ability and could enhance personalized treatment planning and prognosis prediction for AML.","2025","Biomedicines"

Materials and Methods: This retrospective study included 137 patients who underwent liver biopsy or resection between 2016 and 2024, comprising 126 patients with liver metastases and 11 patients with primary liver cancer (hepatocellular carcinoma). Imaging features on contrast-enhanced MRI were evaluated, including lesion number, size, margins, enhancement patterns, presence of capsule, T1/T2 signal characteristics, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) signal, and portal vein thrombosis. Laboratory data such as liver function tests and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) levels were collected. Pathological features recorded included tumor differentiation, vascular invasion, necrosis, and fibrosis. Statistical analyses were performed using chi-squared tests, t-tests, and logistic regression, with a significance level of p < 0.05. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging features was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Results: Liver metastases were more likely to present as multiple lesions (82.5% vs. 27.3%, p < 0.001), had irregular margins (78.6% vs. 36.4%, p = 0.002), rim enhancement (74.6% vs. 18.2%, p < 0.001), and were hypointense on T1-weighted images (85.7% vs. 45.5%, p = 0.004). Primary liver cancers were more likely to be solitary (72.7% vs. 17.5%, p < 0.001), have smooth margins (63.6% vs. 21.4%, p = 0.002), exhibit arterial phase hyperenhancement (81.8% vs. 23.8%, p < 0.001), and portal venous washout (72.7% vs. 19.0%, p < 0.001). Vascular invasion was more common in primary liver cancer (45.5% vs. 11.1%, p = 0.01). AFP levels > 400 ng/mL were significantly associated with primary liver cancer (63.6% vs. 4.8%, p < 0.001). ROC curve analysis showed that a combination of imaging features had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.91 for differentiating the two entities. Conclusions: Imaging features such as lesion number, margin characteristics, enhancement patterns, T1/T2 signal characteristics, and portal venous washout, along with pathological features like vascular invasion and AFP levels, can effectively differentiate liver metastases from primary liver cancer. The diagnostic accuracy of imaging is high when multiple features are combined.","2025","Biomedicines"

The aim of this study was to establish a predictive nomogram for patients with non-transplanted FHR MM. Materials and Methods: The group comprised 215 patients in our center between 1 January 2006 and 1 March 2024. To identify independent risk factors, univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were performed, and a nomogram was constructed to predict non-transplant FHR MM. To evaluate the nomogram's predictive accuracy, we utilized bias-corrected AUC, calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and clinical impact curves (CIC). Results: Multivariate logistic regression demonstrated that younger age at onset, a higher proportion of LDH (more than 220 U/L), pattern A + C of M protein decline patterns, a lower proportion of patients with induction treatment efficacy than VGPR, and those undergoing maintenance therapies were independent risk factors for patients with non-transplanted FHR MM. The AUC scores for the training and internal validation groups were 0.940 (95% CI 0.893-0.986) and 0.978 (95% CI 0.930-1.000). DCA and CIC curves were utilized to further verify the clinical efficacy of the nomogram. Conclusions: We developed a nomogram that enables early prediction of non-transplant FHR MM patients. Younger age at onset, LDH ≥ 220 U/L, an A + C pattern of M-protein decline, and induction therapy efficacy not reaching VGPR are more likely to be FHR MM patients. Patients who do not undergo maintenance therapy are prone to early progression or relapse.","2025","Biomedicines"

Accurate segmentation of blood vessels in retinal images presents a challenging task due to noise, low contrast, and the complex morphology of blood vessel structures. Methods: In this study, we propose a novel ensemble learning framework combining four deep learning architectures: U-Net, ResNet50, U-Net with a ResNet50 backbone, and U-Net with a transformer block. Each architecture is customized to enhance feature extraction and segmentation performance. The models are trained on the DRIVE and STARE datasets to improve the degree of generalization and evaluated using the performance metric accuracy, F1-Score, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC. Results: The ensemble meta-model integrates predictions from these architectures using a stacking approach, achieving state-of-the-art performance with an accuracy of 0.9778, an AUC of 0.9912, and an F1-Score of 0.8231.

Therefore, much effort has been devoted to discovering the pivotal roles of miRNAs in disease incidence to understand the underlying pathogenesis of human diseases. However, identifying miRNA-disease associations using biological experiments is inefficient in terms of cost and time. Methods: Here, we discuss a novel machine-learning model that effectively predicts disease-related miRNAs using a graph convolutional neural network with neural collaborative filtering (GCNCF). By applying the graph convolutional neural network, we could effectively capture important miRNAs and disease feature vectors present in the network while preserving the network structure. By exploiting neural collaborative filtering, miRNAs and disease feature vectors were effectively learned through matrix factorization and deep learning, and disease-related miRNAs were identified. Results: Extensive experimental results based on area under the curve (AUC) scores (0.9216 and 0.9018) demonstrated the superiority of our model over previous models. Conclusions: We anticipate that our model could not only serve as an effective tool for predicting disease-related miRNAs but could be employed as a universal computational framework for inferring relationships across biological entities.","2025","Biomedicines"

Isthmin-1 (Ism1) has recently emerged as a potential marker of metabolic health and was shown in animal studies to associate with metabolic-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD). In this study, we aimed to investigate the circulatory levels of Ism1 in individuals with obesity compared to non-obese individuals and evaluate their association with insulin resistance, MAFLD, and T2D. The primary outcomes of this study are obesity, insulin resistance, MAFLD, and T2D, while the secondary outcome is hypertension; Methods: This is a cross-sectional study involving 450 participants, who were divided based on their obesity status into people with obesity (n = 182) and those without obesity (n = 265). Circulating Ism1 levels were measured by ELISA and were compared between the groups. Insulin resistance was assessed using the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and fatty liver was evaluated using Fibroscan; Results: Our results showed a significant reduction in circulating Ism1 levels in individuals with obesity (p-value = 0.002). Ism1 levels were negatively associated with the odds of T2D, possibly suggesting a protective role. Additionally, individuals with higher CAP scores demonstrated significantly lower Ism1 levels, and the Spearman's rank correlation revealed a negative association between Ism1 and both CAP scores (r = -0.109, p-value = 0.025) and insulin resistance (r = -0.141, p-value = 0.004). Logistic regression analysis further supported Ism1 as an independent significant protective factor against obesity-related metabolic dysfunction. This significance persisted after adjusting for several confounders. Furthermore, our ROC results indicate that circulatory Ism1 levels possess significant diagnostic capability for identifying individuals with obesity-related metabolic imbalances with an area under the curve of 0.764 (95% CI = 0.718, 0.811). Finally, the adjusted multinomial analysis suggested that higher levels of Ism1 may play a protective role against pre-diabetes (AOR = 0.88, 95% CI = 0.838, 0.925) and T2D (AOR = 0.87, 95% CI = 0.814, 0.934); Conclusions: This study suggests that reduced Ism1 levels are linked to increased insulin resistance, MAFLD, and T2D in obese individuals. Our findings further corroborate the protective role of Ism1 and highlight its potential utility as a biomarker for monitoring obesity-related metabolic diseases.","2025","Biomedicines"

Individualized pCR prediction based on clinical information available at biopsy, particularly immunohistochemical (IHC) markers, may help identify patients who could benefit from preoperative chemotherapy. Data from patients with HER2-negative BC who underwent neoadjuvant chemotherapy from 2002 to 2020 (n = 1166) were used to develop multivariable prediction models to estimate the probability of pCR (pCR-prob). The most precise model identified using cross-validation was implemented in an online calculator and a nomogram. Associations among pCR-prob, prognostic IHC3 distant recurrence and disease-free survival were studied using Cox regression and Kaplan-Meier analyses. The model's utility was further evaluated in independent external validation cohorts. 273 patients (23.4%) achieved a pCR. The most precise model had across-validated area under the curve (AUC) of 0.84, sensitivity of 0.82, and specificity of 0.71. External validation yielded AUCs between 0.75 (95% CI, 0.70-0.81) and 0.83 (95% CI, 0.78-0.87). The higher the pCR-prob, the greater the prognostic impact of pCR status (presence/absence): hazard ratios decreased from 0.55 (95% central range, 0.07-1.77) at 0% to 0.20 (0.11-0.31) at 50% pCR-prob. Combining pCR-prob and IHC3 score further improved the precision of disease-free survival prognosis. A pCR prediction model for neoadjuvant therapy decision-making was established. Combining pCR and recurrence prediction allows identification of not only patients who benefit most from neoadjuvant chemotherapy, but also patients with a very unfavorable prognosis for whom alternative treatment strategies should be considered.","2025","Breast cancer research : BCR"

Invasive monitoring of ICP is accurate but is unavailable in many clinical and prehospital settings. Non-invasive modalities have historically been difficult to implement clinically. The retinal arteriovenous ratio (A/V ratio) has shown promise through its relationship with ICP. This study aimed to further elucidate the relationship between ICP, A/V ratio and the intraocular pressure (IOP) measured with non-invasive fundoscopy in a porcine model. We achieved controlled values of ICP ranging from normal (5-15 mmHg) to elevated (> 20 mmHg) within the same animal subject. Six pigs were included. ICP and IOP was measured using an intraparenchymal pressure monitor and a tonometer, respectively. Fundoscopy was performed at baseline and at predefined ICP values. Mixed-effects linear regression revealed a significant inverse correlation between A/V ratio and ICP ≥ 20 mmHg (slope coefficient - 0.0026734 [95%-CI: -0.0039347 - (-0.0014121)], p < 0.001). For ICP < 20 mmHg there was no change in A/V ratio (p = 0.987). Similar results were seen for ICP > IOP with a mean IOP of 10 mmHg. A Wald test showed no significant difference between ICP > IOP and ICP ≥ 20 mmHg. ROC curve analysis revealed an AUC of 0.64 for ICP ≥ 20 mmHg and 0.71 for ICP > IOP. The results support the hypothesis that an increase in ICP was associated with a decrease in A/V ratio. Although a slightly better fit, the model of ICP > IOP was deemed less clinically relevant than ICP ≥ 20 mmHg because of the subjects' IOP. Further research integrating multifactorial models and machine learning is needed to enhance the diagnostic accuracy of A/V ratio via fundoscopy, enabling it to serve as a cost-effective screening tool.","2025","Acta neurochirurgica"

We prospectively enrolled a cohort of 125 infants born preterm with planned clinical follow-up after neonatal intensive care unit discharge. The study included monthly questionnaires for wheeze and visits to a physician or care provider for any respiratory illness. In addition, infant lung function testing near 5 months corrected-age included measures of airways and parenchymal function using forced expiratory flows, alveolar volume (VA), and the carbon monoxide transfer constant (diffusion capacity of lung [DL]/VA). Phenotypes were defined using 2 approaches: an a priori defined phenotypes based on forced expiratory flow 75% and DL/VA z-scores, and an unbiased approach to classifying infants using k-means clustering. We identified 4 pulmonary physiologic phenotypes that distinguished participants with predominantly decreased airway and/or parenchymal function. Although the worst physiologic phenotypes were associated with a lower gestational age at birth, these phenotypes had a better predictive value than gestational age, sex, and diagnosis of bronchopulmonary dysplasia for increased respiratory morbidity during infancy (area under the curve = 0.71 vs 0.63 for respiratory illness and 0.69 vs 0.63 for wheeze). Physiologic pulmonary phenotypes of infants born preterm were associated with differential risks for respiratory morbidities as infants, which may identify heterogeneous risks for long-term respiratory sequelae to individualize therapeutic strategies.","2025","The Journal of pediatrics"

While gut microbiota changes have been linked to depression, the relationship between oral microbiota and depression remains elusive. Our study aims to investigate the oral microbiota in treatment-naïve adolescents experiencing depression and examine their potential associations with cognitive function. Our case-control study comprised two groups of adolescents aged 12-17: the depression group, including treatment-naïve individuals diagnosed with DSM-5 major depressive disorder (MDD), and a healthy control group of non-depressed individuals (HC). Participants underwent structured neuropsychiatric assessments, and fasting morning saliva samples were collected for the 16S rRNA sequencing to investigate the oral microbiota. Significant differences were identified in the α- and β-diversities of the oral microbiota between MDD and HC groups. Specific bacterial taxa, including genera Streptococcus, Neisseria, Hemophilus, Fusobacterium, and g_norank_f_norank_o_Absconditabacteriales_SR1, were significantly associated with MDD. The association extends to cognitive functions, where correlations were observed between certain oral bacteria and cognitive scores, including instant and delayed memory, visual breadth, and speech features for the combined MDD and HC individuals (p < 0.05). Random forest analysis identified ten genera of oral microbes with the highest predictive values for MDD. The area under the curve (AUC) is 0.78 in the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis.

The cases in our series and in the literature were examined for age at presentation, site of lesion, pathology, and presence of other anomalies. All patients in our series were aged ≤ 32 years. All presented with unilocular blood-filled myometrial lesions that did not communicate with the uterine cavity. All were located on the lateral aspect of the uterus in proximity to the round ligament. Of the 22 that have been resected, all were lined by endometrium and smooth muscle. These characteristics are mirrored in the previously described cases in the literature. The frequency of these myometrial cystic masses is such that they can no longer be considered rare. Nevertheless, their etiology remains unclear. These lesions have often been given names suggesting that they are an early representation of adenomyosis. The alternative possibility of a Müllerian anomaly is supported by consistent anatomical location and young age of presentation in most reported cases. Yet the absence of documented associated anomalies raises concerns about this theory. To progress understanding of these lesions, consistent reporting of features including location and the presence or absence of other anomalies is required.

A cross-sectional study was conducted involving 38 amyloid-positive AD patients and 50 cognitively normal controls. The levels of serum PF4 were detected using the Human CXCL4/PF4 enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) Kit. The levels of CSF Aβ42, Aβ40, p-tau181, and t-tau were measured on the fully-automated Lumipulse G1200 platform via commercially available kits. The levels of serum PF4 were significantly decreased in AD patients (5163.51 (3198.24-6301.15) vs. 5859.29 (4126.06-8006.70), Z = -2.30, P = 0.021).

Further analysis showed that serum PF4 levels were positively correlated with CSF Aβ42 levels and Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores, and negatively correlated with CSF t-tau levels. Besides, the area under the curve (AUC) of serum PF4 for AD (AUC = 0.6437, P = 0.022) was comparable to that of CSF Aβ40 (AUC = 0.6400) yet lower than those of CSF Aβ42, ptau181, and t-tau. The AUC slightly increased when combining serum PF4 with other CSF AD biomarkers separately. The serum levels of PF4 were decreased in AD patients and were significantly correlated with the cognitive function and CSF levels of Aβ42 and t-tau.

The optimal threshold was 2.25 mg/L, with a sensitivity of 0.818 and a specificity of 0.566 at this threshold. Early coagulation disorder can occur and last for over 28 days after major burn injury. The serum D-dimer level on the 7th post-burn day may be used as a risk factor to identify the individuals with high-risk of DVT among major burn patients.","2025","Burns : journal of the International Society for Burn Injuries"

Up to date, there is no international consensus on defining disease activity which foretells potential prognosis. This study aims to develop and validate a ""Scoring System for Disease Activity Prognosis in Treatment-Naïve RRMS Patients"" (DAPS-RRMS) to help guiding treatment decisions. A set of clinical and radiological factors predicting RRMS disease activity based on an extensive literature review were identified. Real-world data from 520 treatment-naïve RRMS patients were extracted from the Egyptian MS registry dataset by independent neurologists and were disseminated among a group of MS experts for evaluation of each case separately. To convert this clinical impression into a validated score, ordinal logistic regression was used to develop the scoring system and nomogram; validation was conducted using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC); interrater reliability was assessed using Kendall's coefficient of concordance and the Intraclass Correlation Coefficient (ICC). According to cut off values based on the sum of scores of involved parameters, patients were classified into four categories predicting disease activity, ""Active"" (0-9), ""Highly Active"" (9.5-14), ""Very Highly Active"" (14.5-19), and ""Aggressive"" (>19). The scoring tool demonstrated excellent performance metrics with high inter-rater agreement (Kendall's W 0.764), and reliability including a high area under the curve (AUC) for discriminating between categories. This validated scoring system provides a practical and reliable tool for predicting RRMS disease activity and guiding treatment decisions in treatment-naïve patients, particularly in resource-limited countries.

Although their recognition by intraoperative ultrasound has been described, the possibility of preoperative detection still remains uncertain. We aimed to develop a model to predict their presence before surgery. Patients with caval confluence-located tumors who underwent surgery between 2010 and 2022 were collected and analyzed. A total of 136 eligible patients were assigned randomly into the derivation (n = 96) and validation (n = 40) cohorts. Communicating vessels were recorded as visible or not considering the intraoperative ultrasound findings as reference. A predictive model was built and graphically represented as nomogram. Of 136 patients included, 106 (78%) had communicating vessels. Of patients with communicating vessels, a parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy was performed in 98 (92%; 77% with hepatic vein amputation, 75/98). Of 30 patients without communicating vessels, all underwent an R1 vascular parenchyma-sparing hepatectomy. Operative mortality was nil. No liver congestion occurred. In the former, presence of communicating vessels at the intraoperative ultrasound was detected in 75 (78%) patients, whereas in the validation cohort it was detected in 31 (78%). No differences in the distribution of the variables were found in the 2 cohorts. The model included tumor size at the confluence, tumor number, degree of hepatic vein infiltration, and density of hepatic tissue at contrast-computed tomography, as predictors of communicating vessels in derivation cohort (discrimination was area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.82). Identification of communicating vessels in patients with tumors at the caval confluence opens new surgical options, expanding resectability. The present predictive model may play a useful role in facilitating surgical decision-making, developing and implementing surgical strategies, and guiding resectability improvement efforts.","2025","Surgery"

Despite therapeutic advancements, there remains a critical need for reliable, noninvasive methods to monitor multiple myeloma. Circulating plasma cells (CPCs) in peripheral blood are robust and independent prognostic markers, but their detection is challenging due to their low abundance. Next-generation flow cytometry is commonly used for CPC detection but is not performed in routine clinical practice because it requires expensive instruments, is costly, and time-consuming. This study introduces a cost-effective, rapid surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) assay leveraging gold-deposited magnetic nanoparticles and plasmonic nanoparticles functionalized with anti-CD138 and anti-CD38 antibodies for detecting CPCs in peripheral blood samples. A portable optical device was used for signal recording, enhancing the potential for point-of-care applications. The developed assay is highly sensitive and specific, capable of detecting as few as one or two cells. The application of machine learning algorithms to SERS signal analysis yielded area under the curve values ranging from 0.90 to 0.95, demonstrating excellent performance in differentiating multiple myeloma patients from healthy donors. This SERS method provides a sensitive and accessible way for CPC detection, showing significant potential for multiple myeloma diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and prognosis prediction.","2025","Analytical chemistry"
429,"39854715","Development and validation of a radiomics-visual evoked potential nomogram for preoperative prediction of visual outcome after endoscopic craniopharyngioma resection.","Craniopharyngiomas are rare, benign brain tumors that are primarily treated with surgery. Although the extended endoscopic endonasal approach (EEEA) has evolved as a more reliable surgical alternative and yields better visual outcomes than traditional craniotomy, postoperative visual deterioration remains one of the most common complications, and relevant risk factors are still poorly defined. Hence, identifying risk factors and developing a predictive model for postoperative visual deterioration is indeed necessary. However, there is still a lack of research on these topics. Therefore, the authors used the largest known case series of EEEA for craniopharyngioma to determine pertinent risk factors and develop a nomogram for the noninvasive preoperative prediction of visual outcome. A total of 483 cases of craniopharyngioma (338 in the training cohort, 145 in the validation cohort) between January 2019 and March 2023 were retrospectively reviewed, and related risk factors were identified. In total, 851 radiomic features from the MR images of each case were extracted. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm was used to select features and construct the radiomic score (Rad-score). A support vector machine (SVM) classifier was adopted to construct a radiomic model. Moreover, a clinical-radiomic nomogram was built by multivariable logistic regression. The performance of the nomogram was assessed by its discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility. The overall incidence of postoperative visual deterioration was 9.1%. A lack of intraoperative visual evoked potential (VEP) monitoring (OR 0.221, p = 0.001), larger maximum tumor diameter (OR 1.052, p = 0.014), and tight adherence (OR 2.963, p = 0.044) were demonstrated as independent risk factors for postoperative visual deterioration. The radiomic model using the SVM based on 8 selected features exhibited good discrimination in predicting adhesion strength in the training and validation cohorts (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC] 0.85 vs 0.80). Moreover, the nomogram incorporating the Rad-score and clinical factors showed AUCs of 0.827 and 0.808 in the training and validation sets, respectively, fitting well in calibration curves. Decision curve analysis further confirmed the clinical usefulness of the nomogram. Intraoperative VEP monitoring was proven to help reduce postoperative visual deterioration, while tight adherence and larger maximum tumor diameter were confirmed as independent risk factors. The radiomic model allowed a noninvasive prediction of the adherence strength between the optic nerves and craniopharyngioma. The nomogram showed a promising performance for noninvasively predicting postoperative visual deterioration and may serve as a useful tool for clinical decision-making and patient counseling.","2025","Journal of neurosurgery"

Although the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score standardizes the diagnosis of organ dysfunction, early sepsis detection remains challenging due to its insidious symptoms. Current diagnostic methods, including clinical assessments and laboratory tests, frequently lack the speed and specificity needed for timely intervention, particularly in vulnerable populations such as older adults, intensive care unit (ICU) patients, and those with compromised immune systems. While bacterial cultures remain vital, their time-consuming nature and susceptibility to false negatives limit their effectiveness. Even promising existing machine learning approaches are restricted by reliance on complex clinical factors that could delay results, underscoring the need for faster, simpler, and more reliable diagnostic strategies. This study introduces innovative machine learning models using complete blood count with differential (CBC+DIFF) data-a routine, minimally invasive test that assesses immune response through blood cell measurements, critical for sepsis identification. The primary objective was to implement this model within an artificial intelligence-clinical decision support system (AI-CDSS) to enhance early sepsis detection and management in critical care settings. This retrospective study at Tri-Service General Hospital (September to December 2023) analyzed 746 ICU patients with suspected pneumonia-induced sepsis (supported by radiographic evidence and a SOFA score increase of ≥2 points), alongside 746 stable outpatients as controls. Sepsis infection sources were confirmed through positive sputum, blood cultures, or FilmArray results. The dataset incorporated both basic hematological factors and advanced neutrophil characteristics (side scatter light intensity, cytoplasmic complexity, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio), with data from September to November used for training and data from December used for validation. Machine learning models, including light gradient boosting machine (LGBM), random forest classifier, and gradient boosting classifier, were developed using CBC+DIFF data and were assessed using metrics such as area under the curve, sensitivity, and specificity. The best-performing model was integrated into the AI-CDSS, with its implementation supported through workshops and training sessions. Pathogen identification in ICU patients found 243 FilmArray-positive, 411 culture-positive, and 92 undetected cases, yielding a final dataset of 654 (43.8%) sepsis cases out of 1492 total cases. The machine learning models demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with LGBM achieving the highest area under the curve (0.90), followed by the random forest classifier (0.89) and gradient boosting classifier (0.88). The best-performing LGBM model was selected and integrated as the core of our AI-CDSS, which was built on a web interface to facilitate rapid sepsis risk assessment using CBC+DIFF data. This study demonstrates that by providing streamlined predictions using CBC+DIFF data without requiring extensive clinical parameters, the AI-CDSS can be seamlessly integrated into clinical workflows, enhancing rapid, accurate identification of sepsis and improving patient care and treatment timeliness.","2025","Journal of medical Internet research"

Here, we present a pooled post-hoc subgroup analysis of patients according to background chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) maintenance medication regimens. This analysis aimed to explore the efficacy and safety of ensifentrine in patients receiving long-acting muscarinic antagonists (LAMA) or long-acting beta-agonists with inhaled corticosteroids (LABA + ICS). Eligible patients had moderate to severe COPD, were aged 40-80 years, and were symptomatic at randomization. Patients were randomized 5:3, receiving twice-daily ensifentrine 3 mg or placebo via standard jet nebulizer over 24 weeks. The pooled post-hoc analysis included 485 LAMA patients and 272 LABA + ICS patients. Ensifentrine showed lung function improvement over placebo at week 12, including average FEV1 AUC0-12 h in the LAMA (placebo-corrected least squares mean change from baseline [LSMC], 92 mL; 95% CI, 54, 131; p < 0.001) and LABA + ICS subgroups (LSMC, 74 mL; 95% CI, 27, 121; p = 0.002). Ensifentrine reduced the rate and risk of exacerbations in both LAMA (48% and 50%, respectively) and LABA + ICS (51% and 56%, respectively) subgroups. Ensifentrine-treated patients reported improvement in symptoms and quality of life over 24 weeks. The safety profile of ensifentrine in each subgroup was similar to the profile in the pooled modified intention-to-treat population. Nebulized ensifentrine offers a novel non-steroidal anti-inflammatory and bronchodilator treatment added to existing LAMA or LABA + ICS treatment options in patients with moderate to severe, symptomatic COPD.","2025","Chronic respiratory disease"

To study the correlation of quantitative DCE-MRI parameters of Ktrans, Kep and Ve with subtype, Lugano stage at diagnosis and Ki-67 proliferation index (PI) in nodal lymphoma. 33 patients of age > 12 years with newly diagnosed nodal lymphoma underwent DCE-MRI. Ktrans, Kep and Ve were generated from extended Tofts model and correlated with lymphoma subtype, Lugano staging and Ki-67 PI. Mean Ktrans and Kep values were significantly higher in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) than in Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL). Considering Ki-67 PI value of > 45% as aggressive lymphoma, the mean Ktrans (659.37 x 10-3min-1 versus 288.00 x 10-3min-1, p < 0.001) and Kep (1256.63 x 10-3min-1 versus 689.82 x 10-3min-1, p = 0.004) values in aggressive lymphomas were significantly higher compared to non-aggressive lymphomas. ROC curve analysis revealed a threshold Ktrans value of ≥ 359 x 10-3min-1 and Kep value of ≥ 853 x10-3 min-1 for diagnosing aggressive lymphomas with a sensitivity of 95%, 90%, specificity of 100%,82% and diagnostic accuracy of 91.7%,86.7% respectively. There was no significant difference in DCE-MRI parameters of various Lugano stage subgroups. DCE-MRI parameters have the potential to non-invasively predict the subtype, aggression and Ki-67 PI in nodal lymphoma. The knowledge that Ktrans is higher in aggressive lymphomas is novel.

All received the evaluation of bone mineral density (BMD), appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMI), handgrip strength, calf circumference, 6-meter walking speed, and 5-time chair stand test. The cross-sectional area (RFcsa), thickness (RFthickness), and mean SWV of rectus femoris (RF) were measured by US and shear wave elastography. The clinical characteristics, RFcsa, RFthickness, and SWV, were compared between OP alone and OSP to determine the independent predictors of OSP. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the value of US and SWV for assessment of OSP. The RFcsa, RFthickness, SWV, and BMD of OSP were lower than those of OP alone (all P < 0.05). Through multivariate analysis, the diagnostic performance of the prediction model (area under the ROC curve, AUC, 0.917) composed of RFcsa and SWV was superior to RFcsa (AUC, 0.847), RFthickness (AUC, 0.797), and SWV (AUC, 0.740) alone. Moreover, the prediction model achieved 70.0% sensitivity, 93.0% specificity, and 88.3% accuracy. The RFcsa, RFthickness, and SWV have potential value in assessing muscle in OSP and can be applied to routine clinical management of postmenopausal women. US measured RF thickness, CSA and SWV could assist detection and clinical management of OSP in postmenopausal women.","2025","The British journal of radiology"

Taking into account that haematoxylin and eosin (HE)-stained tumour tissue contains a huge amount of clinically unexploited morphological informations, we developed a weakly-supervised deep-learning approach, SmartProg-MEL, to predict survival outcomes in stages I to III melanoma patients from HE-stained whole slide image (WSI). We designed a deep neural network that extracts morphological features from WSI to predict 5-y overall survival (OS), and assign a survival risk score to each patient. The model was trained and validated on a discovery cohort of primary cutaneous melanomas (IHP-MEL-1, n = 342). Performance was tested on two external and independent datasets (IHP-MEL-2, n = 161; and TCGA cohort n = 63). It was compared with well-established prognostic factors. Concordance index (c-index) was used as a metric. On the discovery cohort, the SmartProg-MEL predicts the 5-y OS with a c-index of 0.78 on the cross-validation data and of 0.72 on the cross-testing series. In the external cohorts, the model achieved a c-index of 0.71 and 0.69 for the IHP-MEL-2 and TCGA dataset respectively. Furthermore, SmartProg-MEL was an independent and the most powerful prognostic factor in multivariate analysis (HR = 1.84, p-value < 0.005). Finally, the model was able to dichotomize patients in two groups-a low and a high-risk group-each associated with a significantly different 5-y OS (p-value < 0.001 for IHP-MEL-1 and p-value = 0.01 for IHP-MEL-2). The performance of our fully automated SmartProg-MEL model outperforms the current clinicopathological factors in terms of prediction of 5-y OS and risk stratification of cutaneous melanoma patients. Incorporation of SmartProg-MEL in the clinical workflow could guide the decision-making process by improving the identification of patients that may benefit from adjuvant therapy.","2025","Journal of the European Academy of Dermatology and Venereology : JEADV"

We retrospectively collected data from two hospitals, consisting of 237 dual-energy CT (DECT) scans, including matched iodine overlay maps, virtual noncontrast, and simulated SECT images. These scans were randomly divided into a training set (n = 190) and an internal validation set (n = 47) in a 4:1 ratio based on the proportion of ICH. Additionally, 26 SECT scans were included as an external validation set. We compared our trans-GAN with state-of-the-art generation methods using several physical metrics of the generated images and evaluated the diagnostic efficacy of the generated images for differentiating ICH from contrast staining. In comparison with other generation methods, the images generated by trans-GAN exhibited superior quantitative performance. Meanwhile, in terms of ICH detection, the use of generated images from both the internal and external validation sets resulted in a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (0.88 vs. 0.68 and 0.69 vs. 0.54, respectively) and kappa values (0.83 vs. 0.56 and 0.51 vs. 0.31, respectively) compared with input SECT images.

Differentially expressed proteins were validated using ELISA and RT-qPCR in a second matched cohort. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves evaluated how well the diagnostic tests performed. The study identified 18 inflammatory-related proteins with significantly different expression levels between ICH patients and controls. These proteins participate in critical biological processes and pathways, such as the regulation of inflammatory mediator secretion, cell death, immune cell proliferation and differentiation, pathogen response, and PI3K-Akt and JAK-STAT pathways. Notably, we discovered for the first time that Kidney Injury Molecule-1 (KIM1) is significantly upregulated in the plasma of ICH patients, suggesting its potential as a predictive and diagnostic biomarker for ICH. Validation results from ELISA and RT-qPCR showed that Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Pentraxin 3 (PTX3), KIM1, and Galectin-9 (Gal-9) concentrations were markedly increased in the blood plasma and white matter of individuals with ICH.

We aim to non-invasively detect BCL-6 overexpression in PCNSL patients using multiparametric MRI and machine learning techniques. 65 patients (101 lesions) with primary central nervous system lymphoma (PCNSL) diagnosed from January 2013 to July 2023, and all patients were randomly divided into a training set and a validation set according to a ratio of 8 to 2. ADC map derived from DWI (b = 0/1000 s/mm2), fast spin echo T2WI, T2FLAIR, were collected at 3.0 T. A total of 2234 radiomics features from the tumor segmentation area were extracted and LASSO were used to select features. Logistic regression (LR), Naive bayes (NB), Support vector machine (SVM), K-nearest Neighbor, (KNN) and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), were used for machine learning, and sensitivity, specificity, accuracy F1-score, and area under the curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the detection performance of five classifiers, 6 groups with combinations of different sequences were fitted to 5 classifiers, and optimal classifier was obtained. BCL-6 status could be identified to varying degrees with 30 models based on radiomics, and model performance could be improved by combining different sequences and classifiers. Support vector machine (SVM) combined with three sequence group had the largest AUC (0.95) in training set and satisfactory AUC (0.87) in validation set.

Between 2009 and 2019, a multicentric registry included all consecutive symptomatic patients with obstructive CAD (at least one ≥ 50% stenosis on CCTA) and was followed for major adverse cardiovascular (MACE) defined by cardiovascular death or nonfatal myocardial infarction. Each coronary segment was scored visually for both the degree of stenosis and composition of plaque, which were classified as non-calcified, mixed, or calcified. To assess the prognostic value of each CCTA findings, different multivariable Cox regression models were used: model 1: clinical (traditional risk factors); model 2: model 1 + CAD burden (number of proximal segments with stenosis ≥ 50% + number of vessels with obstructive CAD); and model 3: model 2 + plaques feature (number of segments with non-calcified plaque). Of 2312 patients (mean age 70 ± 12 years, 46% men), 319 experienced a MACE (13.8%) (median follow-up: 6.7 years (5.9-9.1)). The number of proximal segments with ≥ 50% stenosis, the number of vessels with obstructive CAD, and the number of segments with non-calcified plaque were all independently associated with MACEs (all p < 0.001). The addition of plaque composition analysis (model 3) showed the best improvement in model discrimination and reclassification (C-statistic improvement = 0.03; net reclassification improvement = 28.6%; integrative discrimination index = 5.4%, all p < 0.001). In this population, the analysis of coronary plaque composition had an incremental prognostic value to predict MACEs above a model combining traditional risk factors and CAD burden. Question Several coronary computed tomography angiography (CCTA) studies have shown the potential interest of plaque composition analysis, which can be further evaluated. Findings In symptomatic patients with obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD), plaque composition analysis had an incremental prognostic value above a model combining traditional risk factors and CAD burden. Clinical relevance In symptomatic patients with obstructive CAD, plaque composition analysis using CCTA has a strong incremental prognostic value above a model combining traditional risk factors and CAD burden, thus translating into a more accurate long-term major adverse cardiovascular event prediction.","2025","European radiology"

Cox proportional hazard analysis for event-free survival (EFS) and overall survival (OS) was performed with clinical prognostic factors. Kaplan-Meier analysis and log-rank tests were applied to investigate the prognostic performance of the [18F]FDG PET indices. In total, 66 patients were included in this study. In the univariable Cox regression analysis, peak lean-body mass corrected SUV (SULpeak) (hazard ratio (HR): 1.04), total lesion glycolysis (TLG) (HR: 1.0), and metabolic tumor volume (MTV) (HR: 1.0) were not associated with EFS or OS. Log-rank analysis showed a significant difference in EFS for all SULmax and SULpeak cutoffs. For MTVtotal the maximum Youden, and for TLGtotal, the maximum Youden and maximally selected rank cutoff resulted in a significant EFS difference. No cutoff for any measure showed a significant difference in OS between the groups. ROC curves for event status had an AUC of 0.67, 0.66, 0.64, and 0.64 for SULmax, SULpeak, MTVtotal, and TLGtotal, respectively.

In this multi-center retrospective study, 471 patients with primary IgA nephropathy from four institutions were included (training, n = 275; internal testing, n = 69; external testing, n = 127; respectively). The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator logistic regression with tenfold cross-validation was used to identify the most relevant features. The ML models were constructed based on ultrasomics. The Shapley Additive Explanation (SHAP) was used to explore the interpretability of the models. Logistic regression analysis was employed to combine ultrasomics, clinical data, and ultrasound imaging characteristics, creating a comprehensive model. A receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration, decision curve, and clinical impact curve were used to evaluate prediction performance. To differentiate between mild and moderate-to-severe IF/TA, three prediction models were developed: the Rad_SVM_Model, Clinic_LR_Model, and Rad_Clinic_Model. The area under curves of these three models were 0.861, 0.884, and 0.913 in the training cohort, and 0.760, 0.860, and 0.894 in the internal validation cohort, as well as 0.794, 0.865, and 0.904 in the external validation cohort. SHAP identified the contribution of radiomics features. Difference analysis showed that there were significant differences between radiomics features and fibrosis. The comprehensive model was superior to that of individual indicators and performed well. We developed and validated a model that combined ultrasomics, clinical data, and clinical ultrasonic characteristics based on ML to assess the extent of fibrosis in IgAN. Question Currently, there is a lack of a comprehensive ultrasomics-based machine-learning model for non-invasive assessment of the extent of Immunoglobulin A nephropathy (IgAN) fibrosis.

Consecutive patients with NPC who received immunotherapy between January 2019 and June 2022 were divided into training (n = 111) and validation (n = 66) sets. Tumor radiomics features were extracted from pretreatment MR images. PD-L1 combined positive score (CPS) was calculated using immunohistochemistry. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithm was used for feature selection and radiomics signature construction. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess prediction performance. A total of eleven radiomics features with the greatest discrimination capability were identified by the LASSO algorithm to construct the radiomics signature. In predicting patients with objective response to immunotherapy, radiomics score (Rd-score) yielded a significantly higher area under the ROC curve than that of CPS in both the training (0.790 vs. 0.645, p = 0.025) and the validation (0.735 vs. 0.608, p = 0.038) sets. Multivariate analysis identified the Rd-score as an independent influencing factor in predicting immunotherapy response (odds ratio = 19.963, p < 0.001). Kaplan-Meier analysis indicated that patients with Rd-score ≥ 0.5 showed longer progression-free survival than patients with Rd-score < 0.5 (log-rank p < 0.01). An MRI-based radiomics signature demonstrated greater efficacy than the PD-L1 expression score in predicting immunotherapy response in patients with NPC. Question How does an MRI-based radiomics signature compare with the programmed cell death ligand 1 expression score for predicting immunotherapy response in nasopharyngeal carcinoma? Findings The MRI-based radiomics signature demonstrated superior predictive value compared with programmed cell death ligand 1 expression score in identifying immunotherapy responders.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and functional enrichment analysis were performed respectively. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was conducted to identify key modules of co-expressed genes and genes involved in NK cell function. The diagnostic value of the identified key genes was evaluated using ROC curves, logistic regression analysis, and a nomogram. Real-time PCR (RT-PCR) was used to quantified the expression of genes. Statistical analysis was conducted using the R software package, and a p-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Pathways enrichment analysis revealed the involvement of NK cell-mediated immune pathways and regulation of the innate immune response, indicating the crucial role of innate immunity, especially NK cells, in AS pathogenesis. The construction of a co-expression network revealed that the MElightyellow module was most relevant to the NK cell-mediated immune pathway. IL2RB, CD247, PLEKHF1, EOMES, S1PR5, FGFBP2 from the MElightyellow module were identified as key genes involved in NK cell-mediated immune response and served as potential diagnostic biomarkers for AS, with moderate to high diagnostic values based on AUC values.

Color fundus photographs play a crucial role in the grading of DR. With the advancement of artificial intelligence technologies, numerous researchers have conducted studies on DR grading based on deep features and radiomic features extracted from color fundus photographs. We combine deep features and radiomic features to design a feature fusion algorithm. First, we utilize convolutional neural networks to extract deep features from color fundus photographs and employ radiomic methodologies to extract radiomic features. Subsequently, we design a label relaxation-based collaborative learning algorithm for feature fusion. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed method on two fundus image datasets: the DR1 Dataset and the MESSIDOR Dataset. The proposed method achieved 96.86 of AUC on DR1 and 96.34 of AUC on MESSIDOR, which are better than state-of-the-art methods. Also, the divergence between the training AUC and testing AUC increases substantially after the removal of manifold regularization. Label relaxation can enhance the distinguishability of training samples in the label space, thereby improving the model's classification accuracy. Additionally, graph constraints based on manifold learning methods can mitigate overfitting caused by label relaxation.","2024","Frontiers in cell and developmental biology"

This research aims to characterize the gut microbiota of patients with AR who are sensitized via inhalation, utilizing 16S rRNA sequencing to shed light on the pathogenesis of AR and identify potential therapeutic targets. To achieve the study's objectives, we compared the microbiota profiles between patients with AR and healthy controls. Microbial diversity was assessed using alpha and beta diversity indices, and differential microbiota populations were identified through Linear discriminant analysis Effect Size (LEfSe) analysis. A Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression model was employed to pinpoint key species. Additionally, PICRUSt2 was utilized to predict the functional pathways associated with these identified species. The analysis identified a total of 1,122 common species, along with 1,803 species associated with AR and 1,739 species associated with healthy controls.

For statistical significance and effect size, we performed Berman Z1 tests and Areas Under Curves (AUC) for Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves.ResultsAfter accounting for population density, relative intensity of COVID-19 remained consistent in relation to distance from urban facilities across waves. Although non-parametric estimations of the relative intensity of cases showed fluctuations with distance from facilities, Berman's Z1 tests were significant for health centres only (p < 0.032) when compared with complete spatial randomness. The AUC of ROC curves for population density was above 0.75 and ca 0.6 for all urban facilities.ConclusionResults reflect the difficulty in assessing facilities' effect in propagating infectious disease, particularly in compact cities. Lack of evidence directly linking higher case intensity to proximity to urban facilities shows the need to clarify the role of urban structure and planning in shaping the spatial distribution of epidemics within cities.","2025","Euro surveillance : bulletin Europeen sur les maladies transmissibles = European communicable disease bulletin"

The purpose of this observational study was to investigate the association between maternal serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels in late pregnancy and the risk of ABO, and to evaluate its predictive value of maternal ALP levels for ABO in women with singleton pregnancies. A total of 11 853 consecutive pregnant women underwent hepatic and renal function tests, lipid profile assessments, ALP and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels measurements upon admission for labour. Their clinical perinatal parameters and outcomes were also analysed. The prevalence of PTB, SGA, and LGA in this study was 7.2% (n = 849), 8.9% (n = 1053), and 15.6% (n = 1844), respectively. With increasing quartiles of maternal serum ALP levels, the foetal gestational age increased by 0.58 weeks (95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.50-0.66), 0.78 weeks (95% CI = 0.70-0.86), and 0.98 weeks (95% CI = 0.90-1.06), respectively, and the birth weight increased by 62.91 g (95% CI = 43.96-81.86), 91.54 g (95% CI = 72.41-110.67), and 117.92 g (95% CI = 98.18-137.67), respectively. Compared to women in the bottom quartile of ALP, those in the top quartile had a lower risk of PTB (adjusted odds ratio (OR) = 0.14; 95% CI = 0.11-0.18), a lower risk of SGA (adjusted OR = 0.65; 95% CI = 0.53-0.80), and a higher risk of LGA (adjusted OR = 1.92; 95% CI = 1.62-2.28). Sensitivity analyses conducted among individuals without advanced maternal age, obesity, multiparity, pregnancy complications, and PTB (for SGA/LGA) validated the consistency of these results. More importantly, adding ALP to the established model significantly increased the area under the curve (AUC) for predicting adverse birth outcomes: for PTB, the AUC increased from 0.761 to 0.809 (P < 0.001); for SGA, it increased from 0.754 to 0.759 (P = 0.014); and for LGA, it increased from 0.750 to 0.755 (P < 0.001). Maternal serum ALP levels in late pregnancy are significantly associated with the risk of ABO.

The current gold standard for liver fibrosis is invasive liver biopsy. Therefore, a less invasive biomarker that accurately reflects the stage of liver fibrosis is highly desirable. This study enrolled 269 patients with liver biopsy-proven MASLD. Patients were divided into three groups (F0/1 (n = 41/85), F2 (n = 47), and F3/4 (n = 72/24)) according to fibrosis stage. We performed serum N-glycomics and identified glycan biomarker for fibrosis stage. Moreover, we explored the carrier proteins and developed a sandwich ELISA to measure N-glycosylation changes of carrier protein. Comprehensive N-glycomic analysis revealed significant changes in the expression of A2F bisect and its precursors as fibrosis progressed. The sum of neutral N-glycans carrying bisecting GlcNAc and core Fuc (neutral sum) had a better diagnostic performance to evaluate advanced liver fibrosis (AUC = 0.804) than conventional parameters (FIB4 index, aspartate aminotransferase-to-alanine aminotransferase ratio (AAR), and serum level of Mac-2-binding protein glycol isomer (M2BPGi). The combination of the neutral sum and FIB4 index enhanced diagnostic performance (AUC = 0.840). IgM, IgA, and complement C3 were identified as carrier proteins with A2F bisect N-glycan. A sandwich ELISA based on N-glycans carrying bisecting GlcNAc and IgA showed similar diagnostic performance than the neutral sum. A2F bisect N-glycan and its precursors are promising candidate biomarkers for advanced fibrosis in MASLD patients. Analysis of these glycan alterations on IgA may have the potential to serve as a novel ELISA diagnostic tool for MASLD in routine clinical practice.

Our study aims to assess the association of early-phase tau-PET scans and 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) PET and their comparability in discriminating Alzheimer's disease (AD) patients and differentiating neurodegenerative patterns. 58 subjects evaluated at the Geneva Memory Center underwent dual-phase 18F-Flortaucipir-PET with early-phase acquisition (eTAU) and 18F-FDG-PET within 1 year. A subsample of 36 participants also underwent dual-phase amyloid-PET (eAMY). Standardized uptake value ratios (SUVRs) were calculated to assess the correlation of eTAU and their respective 18F-FDG-PET and eAMY scans. Hypometabolism and hypoperfusion maps and their spatial overlap were also evaluated at the individual level visually and semiquantitatively. Receiver operating characteristic analyses were performed to compare the discriminative power of eTAU, FDG, and eAMY SUVR between A-/T- and A+/T + participants. Strong positive correlations were found between eTAU and FDG SUVRs (r = 0.84, p < 0.001) and eTAU and eAMY SUVRs (r > 0.87, p < 0.001). Clusters of significant hypoperfusion with good correspondence to hypometabolism topographies were found at the individual level, independently of the underlying neurodegenerative patterns. Both eTAU and FDG SUVRs significantly distinguished A+/T + from A-/T- individuals (AUCeTAU=0.604, AUCFDG=0.748) with FDG performing better than eTAU (p = 0.04). eAMY and eTAU SUVR showed comparable discriminative power. Early-phase 18F-Flortaucipir-PET can provide perfusion information closely related to brain regional glucose metabolism and perfusion measured by early-phase amyloid-PET, even if less accurate than FDG-PET as a biomarker for neurodegeneration.","2025","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging"

We studied plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 for CSF Aβ status discrimination in a cohort of consecutive patients attending an academic memory clinic in Spain (July 2019-June 2024). All patients had CSF AD biomarkers performed as part of their routine clinical assessment. Aβ positivity was defined with a local cut-off of CSF Aβ1-42 < 600 pg/mL; in patients with borderline Aβ1-42 values or when there was a mismatch between the Aβ and the T status (T + if CSF p-tau181 ≥ 65 pg/mL), a ratio Aβ1-42/Aβ1-40 < 0.07 was used. Plasma p-tau217 and p-tau181 were measured retrospectively, from blood samples collected at first visit, with Fujirebio Lumipulse and Quanterix Simoa assays, respectively. We included 468 patients (mean age 67 years, 50% female, 61% Aβ positive). Plasma p-tau217 outperformed plasma p-tau181 in discriminating CSF Aβ status (AUC 0.95 vs 0.90, p = 0.005). A 97.5% sensitivity and specificity plasma p-tau217 algorithm, classifying patients into three groups of Aβ probability (Low, Intermediate and High), resulted in 67% of patients in the Low and High groups, having their Aβ status predicted (as negative and positive, respectively) with 96% accuracy. The remaining 33% in the Intermediate group were candidates to undergo CSF/PET testing. A model with a 10% variation in p-tau217 levels yielded small changes in accuracy (95%). In conclusion, plasma p-tau217 could have discriminated CSF Aβ status in two-thirds of patients with very high accuracy in a memory clinic cohort. These results support the implementation of plasma p-tau217 as an initial diagnostic tool in memory clinics for AD diagnosis, reducing the need for more invasive/expensive testing.","2025","Journal of neurology"

Biochemical parameters and clinical variables were retrospectively analyzed in 200 patients. The optimal cut-off points were determined using ROC curve analysis. Results were correlated with analytical and clinical variables and patient outcomes. PoHC incidence in POD-1 was 46%; THPT and PtHPT were 37 and 9%, respectively. Ionized calcium < 4.43 mg/dL on POD-1 predicted PoHC (AUC = 0.9) better than PTH and serum calcium. PTH < 8.06 pg/mL on POD-1 predicted PtHPT (AUC = 0.797). Multivariate analysis identified PTH < 21.2 pg/mL, ionized calcium < 4.43 mg/dL, and serum calcium < 8.76 mg/dL on POD-1 as significant PoHC risk factors.

This study explores the use of photoacoustic (PA) imaging combined with attention-guided deep learning (DL) for precise prediction of ALN status. This retrospective study included patients with histologically confirmed early-stage breast cancer from 2022 to 2024, randomly divided (8:2) into training and test cohorts. All patients underwent preoperative dual modal photoacoustic-ultrasound (PA-US) examination, were treated with surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy or ALN dissection, and were pathologically examined to determine the ALN status. Attention-guided DL model was developed using PA-US images to predict ALN status. A clinical model, constructed via multivariate logistic regression, served as the baseline for comparison. Subsequently, a nomogram incorporating the DL model and independent clinical parameters was developed. The performance of the models was evaluated through discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. A total of 324 patients (mean age ± standard deviation, 51.0 ± 10.9 years) were included in the study and were divided into a development cohort (n = 259 [79.9%]) and a test cohort (n = 65 [20.1%]). The clinical model incorporating three independent clinical parameters yielded an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.775 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.711-0.829) in the training cohort and 0.783 (95% CI, 0.654-0.897) in the test cohort for predicting ALN status. In comparison, the nomogram showed superior predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.906 (95% CI, 0.867-0.940) in the training cohort and 0.868 (95% CI, 0.769-0.954) in the test cohort. Decision curve analysis further confirmed the nomogram's clinical applicability, demonstrating a better net benefit across relevant threshold probabilities. This study highlights the effectiveness of attention-guided PA imaging in breast cancer patients, providing novel nomograms for individualized clinical decision-making in predicting ALN node status.","2025","Academic radiology"

To overcome this limitation, we explored the association with the outcome of the effective RVEF (eRVEF), which accounts for the tricuspid regurgitant volume (RegVol). 513 patients with STR (mean age 75±13 years, 39% atrial STR, 58% severe) underwent complete two-, three-dimensional, and Doppler echocardiography. eRVEF was computed as RV forward SV/RV end-diastolic volume, where forward SV was obtained by subtracting the tricuspid RegVol from the total RVSV. The endpoint was a composite of all-cause death and heart failure hospitalization. After a mean follow-up of 18±15 months, 195 patients (38%) reached the composite endpoint. At time-dependent receiver operating characteristic analysis, eRVEF (AUC 0.72, 95%CI 0.68-0.77) showed a stronger association with outcome than RVEF (AUC 0.65, 95%CI 0.59-0.70, p=0.006), tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (AUC 0.64, 95%CI 0.59-0.69, p= 0.01), RV free-wall longitudinal strain (AUC 0.63, 95%CI 0.58-0.68, p= 0.003), and RV fractional area change (AUC 0.55, 95%CI 0.50-0.60, p<0.001). The eRVEF cut-off associated with an excess event rate was 20% on spline curve modeling. Patients with eRVEF <20% demonstrated a higher rate of events at 2 years (65 ± 6%) than those having an eRVEF ≥20% (22 ±7%, log-rank <0.0001). eRVEF <20% was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of experiencing the composite endpoint (HR: 3.54 [2.61-4.79], p<0.001). On different models of multivariable analysis, eRVEF as a continuous variable remained independently associated with the combined endpoint (HR: 0.96; 95% CI= 0.94-0.98; p<0.001). In patients with STR, eRVEF was more closely associated with all-cause mortality and heart failure hospitalizations than RVEF and other conventional echocardiographic indices of RV function.","2025","Journal of the American Society of Echocardiography : official publication of the American Society of Echocardiography"

The continuous release of proinflammatory cytokines causes muscle atrophy and adipocyte breakdown, ultimately resulting in cachexia. Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are emerging as potential biomarkers associated with cachexia, as they indirectly regulate muscle and fat tissue metabolism. This study aimed to identify inflammatory-related, plasma-circulating lncRNAs characteristic of cachexia in patients with CHF. The secondary objective was to assess the clinical utility of these selected lncRNAs as diagnostic and predictive markers for cachexia. Blood plasma samples were collected from 157 newly diagnosed patients with CHF (91 males and 66 females; mean age: 72 ± 13 y) for lncRNA extraction. Molecular testing, using RT2 lncRNA qRT-PCR Array Human Cell Development, Differentiation, and Inflammatory Panel was performed in 2 phases: the discovery phase (screening of 148 lncRNAs in 8 patients) and validation phase (validation of the identified lncRNAs in 157 patients). Five lncRNAs were found to be differentially expressed in the discovery phase. In the validation phase, 2 of these 5 lncRNAs-SNHG5 and ZFAS1-showed significant expression differences between cachectic and noncachectic patients in the entire study group (both P < 0.001). The combined downregulation of ZFAS1 and upregulation of SNHG5 was identified as an unfavorable lncRNA signature primarily associated with poor nutritional status in females (low fat-free mass, fat-free mass index, and body mass index), abnormal laboratory results (hypoalbuminemia and high concentrations of inflammatory markers), and an increased incidence of cachexia in patients with CHF. When this lncRNA signature was combined with serum C-reactive protein and albumin concentrations, it effectively differentiated between cachectic and noncachectic patients (area under the curve = 1.0). The presence of this unfavorable signature was associated with a 9-fold increased likelihood (odds ratio = 9.2) of cachexia in the study cohort. The identified lncRNA signature demonstrates potential clinical value for distinguishing and predicting cachexia in patients with CHF.","2025","The Journal of nutrition"

However, there is a lack of objective and universally applicable prediction methods for AND in clinical practice. We leveraged sociodemographic and pregnancy-related data to develop and validate a machine learning-based AND prediction model. Data from 20,950 pregnant women form 3 hospitals were used and divided into training and test sets. AND was defined as an EPDS score of 10 or above. Using machine learning, we selected 34 characteristic variables and divided them into three categories based on clinical practice: Base Variables, General Variables, and Obstetric Variables. Based on this classification, we constructed four different AND random forest prediction models: the Base Model, the Base+General Model, the Base+Obstetric Model, and the Full Model. The AUC range in the test set was 0.687-0.710. The Base+General Model achieved the best performance with an AUC of 0.710 (95 % CI: 0.693-0.710) in predicting AND risk during the late pregnancy period. The AUC of the Base Model was only 0.022 lower than that of the top-performing model, indicating its solid foundation for early AND screening. We have only analyzed the dataset from two eastern cities, and have not yet validated our models in an external dataset. Machine learning-based prediction models offer the capability to anticipate the risk of AND across different pregnancy stages. This enables the earlier and more accurate identification of pregnant women who may be at risk, facilitating timely interventions for improving outcomes for both mothers and their offspring.","2025","Journal of affective disorders"

If the risk of fracture can be forecasted, it would aid the shared decision-making process related to cementless stems. Our study aimed to develop and validate predictive models of periprosthetic femoral fracture (PPFF) necessitating revision and reoperation after elective total hip arthroplasty (THA). We included 154,519 primary elective THAs from the Swedish Arthroplasty Register (SAR), encompassing 21 patient-, surgical-, and implant-specific features, for model derivation and validation in predicting 30-day, 60-day, 90-day, and one-year revision and reoperation due to PPFF. Model performance was tested using the area under the curve (AUC), and feature importance was identified in the best-performing algorithm. The Lasso regression excelled in predicting 30-day revisions (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.85), while the Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) model outperformed other models by a slight margin for all remaining endpoints (AUC range: 0.79 to 0.86). Predictive factors for revision and reoperation were identified, with patient features such as increasing age, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists grade (> III), and World Health Organization obesity classes II to III associated with elevated risks. A preoperative diagnosis of idiopathic necrosis increased revision risk. Concerning implant design, factors such as cementless femoral fixation, reverse-hybrid fixation, hip resurfacing, and small (< 35 mm) or large (> 52 mm) femoral heads increased both revision and reoperation risks. This is the first study to develop machine-learning models to forecast the risk of PPFF necessitating secondary surgery. Future studies are required to externally validate our algorithm and assess its applicability in clinical practice.","2025","Bone & joint research"

This study aims to investigate whether multiple adverse childhood experiences have a long-term impact on markers of these systems - cortisol secretion and heart rate variability - in adulthood. Data were from the Whitehall II cohort study. Fourteen adversities, collected retrospectively in midlife, were considered. Outcomes were total amount of cortisol secretion during the day (area under the curve [AUC]), cortisol awakening response (CAR), and diurnal slope, estimated from six saliva samples taken on a weekday; and resting heart rate (rHR) and heart rate variability (HRV) measured for five minutes at three time points over 10 years with the last measures taken at the same time as the salivary measurement. Regression models were used to examine the association of adversities with AUC, CAR, rHR and HRV and multilevel modelling was applied to analyses of cortisol diurnal slope and the 10-year follow-up of rHR and HRV. At least one early life adversity was reported by 68 % of participants. There was little evidence that increasing number of adversities was associated with any measures of cortisol, rHR or HRV or 10-year change in rHR or HRV. Of the individual adversities, only parental death was associated with increased AUC and CAR. In conclusion, although the HPA axis and autonomic nervous system have been hypothesized as mechanisms relating to adverse childhood experiences with health, our study finds no evidence to support this.","2025","Psychoneuroendocrinology"

The performance of previously reported radiological feature-based criteria of VETC, including the SN (size and necrosis) score, the VETC nomogram, and Fan's model, were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and compared using the DeLong method. Imaging estimated VETC stratification was assessed for its association with early recurrence. Ninety-four patients (49.2%) were pathologically identified as VETC-positive HCC. No significant differences were found between CT and gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI regarding the performance of the criteria (allP> 0.05). However, the VETC nomogram, which incorporates tumor size, necrosis, and enhancement pattern, outperformed the SN score and Fan's model (AUC: 0.825 vs. 0.716 and 0.588 at CT; 0.841 vs. 0.721 and 0.621 at gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI, bothP< 0.001).

We conducted a retrospective analysis of gastric cancer (GC) patients with confirmed pathology from October 2019 to May 2023. All patients underwent preoperative and postoperative CT scans to assess visceral fat area (VFA), subcutaneous fat area (SFA), skeletal muscle area (SMA), and skeletal muscle density (SMD), along with calculating their respective rates of change. Multivariate Cox regression analyses were used to identify independent predictors of RFS in male and female patients separately, and nomogram models were subsequently developed. The models' predictive performance was assessed using calibration curves, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The study included 287 patients, consisting of 185 males and 102 females. At baseline, males had a lower subcutaneous adipose tissue index (SATI) but higher skeletal muscle index (SMI) and SMD compared to females (p＜0.001).

Although ecological drivers of V. vulnificus in the environment have been well-characterized, fewer models have been able to apply this to human infection risk due to limited surveillance. The Cholera and Other Vibrio Illness Surveillance (COVIS) system database has reported V. vulnificus infections in the United States since 1988, offering a unique opportunity to both explore the forecasting capabilities machine learning could provide and to characterize complex environmental drivers of V. vulnificus infections. Machine learning models, in the form of random forest classification models, were trained and refined using the epidemiological data from 2008 to 2018, six environmental variables (sea surface temperature, salinity, chlorophyll a concentration, sea level, land surface temperature, and runoff rate) and categorical encoders to assess our predictive potential to forecast V. vulnificus infections based on environmental data. The highest-performing model, which used balanced classes, had an Area Under the Curve score of 0.984 and a sensitivity of 0.971, highlighting the potential of machine learning to anticipate areas and periods of V. vulnificus risk. A higher false positive rate was found when the model was applied to real-world imbalanced surveillance data, which is pertinent amid modeled underreporting and misdiagnosis ratios of V. vulnificus infections. Further models were also developed to explore multilevel spatial resolution, finding state-specific models can improve specificity and early warning system potential by exclusively using lagged environmental data. The machine learning approach was able to characterize nonlinear and interacting environmental associations driving V. vulnificus infections. This study accentuates the potential of machine learning and robust surveillance for forecasting environmentally associated marine infections, providing future directions for improvements, further application, and operationalization. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP15593.","2025","Environmental health perspectives"

The performance of N1 models showed the highest AUC(0.80) for T2w+PET. To predict M1, the T2w+ADC model showed the highest AUC(0.93). Whole-gland PET/MRI-radiomics may provide a reliable model to predict csPCa. Also, acceptable performance was reached for predicting metastatic disease in our limited population. Our findings may support the value of whole-gland radiomics for non-invasive csPCa detection and prediction of metastatic disease. Whole-gland PET/MRI-radiomics, a less operator-dependent segmentation method, can be potentially used for treatment personalization in PCa patients.","2025","The British journal of radiology"

Initially, a comprehensive analysis was conducted on exosome-related genes from the BRCA cohort in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Three prognostic genes (JUP, CAPZA1 and ARVCF) were identified through univariate Cox regression and Lasso-Cox regression analyses, and a metastasis-related risk score model was established based on these genes. Immune cell infiltration, immune escape and drug sensitivity disparities between high- and low-risk groups were assessed using CIBERSORT and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) methods. High- and low-risk cell populations were discerned based on the expression of prognostic genes in BRCA scRNA-seq data. M0 and M1 macrophages significantly promote the metastasis of breast cancer (BRCA). The developed prognostic model demonstrates good predictive performance for patient survival at 1, 3 and 5 years, with AUC values of 0.654, 0.602 and 0.635, respectively. Compared to the low-risk group, the high-risk group exhibits increased immune cell infiltration and higher levels of immune evasion. scRNA-seq data reveal that high-risk cells have significantly higher risk scores and exhibit notable differences in signalling pathways and intercellular communication patterns. This study presents a novel risk score model based on exosome-related genes, validated by comprehensive analyses including differential expression, survival analysis and external dataset validation. The model's clinical significance is reinforced through its ability to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups with distinct survival outcomes and immune landscape characteristics. The integration of RNA-seq and scRNA-seq data highlights the predictive accuracy of the model and underscores its potential for identifying novel therapeutic targets and improving patient prognosis.","2025","Annals of medicine"

The aim of this study was to evaluate if a new approach for ERM is effective to keep ILM during surgery. Retrospective consecutive case series. ERM was directly grasped with forceps at the site where the scale of submembrane space imaged in OCT was maximum. After the removal of ERM, ILM was stained with brilliant blue G and the area of remaining ILM was graded with 5 patterns. The relationship between ILM preservation and submembrane space was analyzed with ROC curve. Thirty-three eyes of 33 patients undergoing ERM surgery (14 women, mean age: 69.2 years) were enrolled. There were 3 eyes with stage 1, 11 eyes with stage 2, 18 eyes with stage 3, and 1 eye with stage 4. The mean maximum distance between ERM and ILM was 80.5 ± 36.0 μm before surgery. ILM was preserved after initial membrane peeling in 21 of 33 eyes (63.6%). ERM-ILM distance correlated with ILM grading (Spearman rank coefficient: P = 0.03). ROC curve analysis identified cutoff value of ERM-ILM distance for ILM preservation was 66 μm[AUC (95% CI):0.7143 (0.5192-0.9093)]. Eyes with larger ERM-ILM distance are likely to show preserved ILM during ERM surgery. ERM-ILM distance appears to be a biomarker of ILM preservation during ERM surgery, which would be useful to minimize neuroretinal damage in eyes with glaucoma and related diseases.","2025","Japanese journal of ophthalmology"

Compressed sensing is a technique that allows for faster MRI imaging by sampling fewer data points and reconstructing the image via optimization techniques, crucial for capturing the rapid movements involved in swallowing. This study aimed to analyze swallowing function and locations in patients with head and neck cancer and healthy individuals using Cine-MRI based on compressed sensing. This comparative study enrolled 36 patients with dysphagia and 10 healthy controls at the Department of Radiology, Yunnan Cancer Hospital between June 2020 and January 2021. Significant correlations were found between primary tumor location and Cine-MRI parameters, and between swallowing function and Cine-MRI parameters. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the combined Cine-MRI-related parameters in predicting mild and severe dysphagia were 0.806 (95% CI: 0.662-0.949).

To compare the diagnostic accuracy of the main PA (MPA) and right PA (RPA) sizes for the echocardiographic detection of PH in dogs, and to evaluate differences between precapillary and postcapillary PH dogs. Four hundred four dogs; 136 controls and 268 with PH. Prospective, multicenter, observational study. The MPA, maximum and minimum RPA diameter were normalized to body weight (MPA_N, RPAmax_N, and RPAmin_N). The MPA was also indexed to the ascending aorta (MPA/AO), while the RPA size was indexed to the aortic annulus (RPAmax/Aod and RPAmin/Aod). The right pulmonary artery distensibility index (RPADi) was also calculated. The diagnostic accuracy of PA parameters for PH was assessed through the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and area under the curve (AUC). Measurement variability was assessed trough the coefficient of variation (CV). The RPADi, RPAmin_N, and RPAmin/Aod showed similar diagnostic accuracy for the detection of PH (AUC = 0.975, AUC = 0.971, and AUC = 0.953, respectively), higher than MPA/AO (AUC = 0.926), MPA_N (AUC = 0.880), RPAmax_N (AUC = 0.814), and RPAmax/Aod (AUC = 0.803; P < .05). Aside from RPAmax variables, no differences were found between precapillary and postcapillary PH. RPA size parameters showed lower CVs in comparison to MPA/AO and RPADi. Although MPA/AO showed an excellent sensitivity and specificity for the detection of PH, the RPAmin exhibited a higher diagnostic accuracy and less measurement variability, thus could represent a new useful parameter for the detection of PH in dogs.","2025","Journal of veterinary internal medicine"

Recently, we demonstrated an increased APC (activated protein C) response in asymptomatic FVL carriers compared with FVL carriers with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after in vivo coagulation activation. Here, we further explored this association using a recently developed ex vivo model based on patient-specific endothelial colony-forming cells (ECFCs). ECFCs and citrated plasma were obtained from FVL carriers with previous VTE (VTE+, n=9), FVL carriers without previous VTE (VTE-, n=8), and 7 healthy controls. Coagulation was activated by TF (tissue factor) in defibrinated recalcified plasma added to confluent cell cultures. Thrombin and APC concentration were measured over time, and the respective areas under the curve were calculated. Additionally, inhibition kinetics of exogenously added APC, APC inhibitor levels, and APC sensitivity ratios were measured in plasma. Expression of TM (thrombomodulin) and EPCR (endothelial protein C receptor) on ECFCs was assessed using cell-based ELISAs. In autologous plasma on ECFCs, the APC response (area under the curve APC/area under the curve thrombin) was higher in FVL VTE- than in FVL VTE+ patients (0.138 versus 0.028; P=0.026). APC inhibitor levels, APC inactivation kinetics, and APC sensitivity ratios did not differ between cohorts. Crossover experiments, which combined pooled plasma from FVL VTE- patients with FVL VTE+ ECFCs in the ex vivo model, and vice versa, showed increased APC response rates when FVL VTE- ECFCs were used, regardless of the plasma component. In cell-based ELISAs, TM and EPCR expression showed no significant difference. Although the FVL gene product induces an almost identical APC resistance phenotype in plasma, the endothelial cell-dependent APC response rates differ significantly, with a higher APC response in asymptomatic FVL carriers. Further studies are warranted to elucidate the disease-modulating role of the endothelium in FVL carriers at the molecular level.","2025","Arteriosclerosis, thrombosis, and vascular biology"

Besides, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve has become a popular index for summarizing the overall accuracy of a marker. However, the nature of the relationship between the marker and the outcome, and the role that potential confounders play in this relationship could be fundamental in order to extrapolate the observed results. Directed acyclic graphs commonly used in epidemiology and in causality, could provide good feedback for learning the possibilities and limits of this extrapolation applied to the binary classification problem. Both the covariate-specific and the covariate-adjusted receiver operating characteristic curves are valuable tools, which can help to a better understanding of the real classification abilities of a marker. Since they are strongly related with the conditional distributions of the marker on the positive (subjects with the studied characteristic) and negative (subjects without the studied characteristic) populations, the use of proportional hazard regression models arises in a very natural way. We explore the use of flexible proportional hazard Cox regression models for estimating the covariate-specific and the covariate-adjusted receiver operating characteristic curves.

This cross-sectional study included 83 T2DM subjects without pre-existing cardiovascular diseases. CIMT was measured by color doppler ultrasonography, while serum Metrnl level was measured by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) assay. According to the CIMT status, the subjects were divided into two groups: T2DM without atherosclerosis (DM-AS, CIMT<1.0mm) and T2DM with atherosclerosis (DM+AS, CIMT ≥1.0mm or carotid plaque). Serum Metrnl level was significantly increased in DM+AS group as compared to DM-AS group (0.77 ± 0.24 vs 0.51 ± 0.28 ng/ml, P <0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis showed that T2DM subjects in the fourth quartile of Metrnl levels demonstrated significantly higher risk of the presence of carotid atherosclerosis (P <0.05). The ROC curve used to identify the diagnostic accuracy of serum Metrnl level in the predication of T2DM subjects with carotid atherosclerosis revealed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.742.

The serum uric acid-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (UHR) has been recognized as a novel marker for metabolic diseases, including MASLD. However, all previous studies were performed in adults. To explore the relationship between the UHR and MASLD in Chinese children with obesity. A retrospective study was conducted including 1284 obese children hospitalized at Beijing Children's Hospital between January 2016 and December 2022. Logistic regression analysis and restricted cubic splines were performed to assess the association between the UHR and the odds of MASLD. The receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to estimate the diagnostic value of UHR for MASLD in children with obesity. The prevalence of MASLD was high, which reached 61.76% in children with obesity. UHR levels were higher in obese children with MASLD than those with non-MASLD for both genders. After dividing all individuals into three groups according to the tertiles of UHR, the prevalence rate of MASLD increased progressively from the tertile 1 to tertile 3 of UHR (34.11% vs. 70.56% vs. 80.61%). Logistic regression analysis showed that obese children with higher UHR levels were significantly associated with MASLD risk, independent of confounding factors such as age, gender, body mass index (BMI), fasting blood glucose (FBG), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), triglycerides (TG), and creatinine (Cr). The non-linear relationship analysis demonstrated that a UHR between approximately 300 and 900 suggested a saturation effect of MASLD risk. ROC analysis indicated that UHR might serve as a predictive marker for diagnosing MASLD in obese children. In children with obesity, UHR is significantly associated with MASLD and might serve as a novel and useful predictor for MASLD onset.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

While there are over 2,600 different serovars of NTS, epidemiological data suggests that certain serovars are better at causing disease than others, resulting in the majority of reported human illnesses in the United States. To improve food safety, there is a need to rapidly detect these more pathogenic serovars to facilitate their removal from the food supply. Addressing this need, we conducted a comparative analysis of 23 closed Salmonella genomic sequences of five serotypes. The analysis pinpointed eight genes (sseK2, sseK3, gtgA/gogA, avrA, lpfB, SspH2, spvD, and invA) that in combination, identify 7 of the 10 leading Salmonella serovars attributed to human illnesses in the US each year (i.e., Serovars of Concern or SoC). A multiplex PCR assay was developed to detect the presence of these genes, with strains amplifying five or more targets designated Highly Pathogenic Salmonella, or HPS. The utility of the resulting HPS assay for identifying SoC was examined in silico, using BLAST to determine the distribution of gene targets among closed Salmonella genome sequences in GenBank (n = 2,192 representing 148 serotypes) and by assaying 1,303 Salmonella (69 serotypes), isolated from FSIS regulatory samples. Comparison of serotypes identified by the assay as HPS, with those identified as SoC, produced an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 92.2% with a specificity of 96% and a positive predictive value of 97.4%, indicating the HPS assay has strong ability to identify SoC.

Multivariate regression models and Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were used for data analyzing. We collected a total of 1174 complete samples. Among the five blood lipid indexes tested in this study, TG (triglyceride) is most closely related to various body measurements (P < 0.05). WC (Waist circumference) has the greatest risk for abnormal TG levels (OR, 2.61; P < 0.001) and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) levels(OR, 1.96; P < 0.001).WHR has the greatest risk of abnormal low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels (OR, 1.35; P < 0.05) and non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels(OR, 1.59; P < 0.001). ROC curve analyses revealed that all the tested variables gave the highest area under the curve (AUC) values for predicting high TG in comparison to other plasma lipid abnormalities. The AUC of WC, AVI and BMI were 0.81, 0.80 and 0.79 respectively.

We applied GEO2R to find DEFRGs and overlapped them among the picked datasets. We performed functional enrichment analysis to explore their biological functions. We built an optimal model with least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalized Cox proportional hazards regression. We tested the clinical value of the signature with survival analysis, ROC curve, decision curve analysis and a prognostic nomogram. We also confirmed the model externally with plasma samples from our center's patients. A prognostic signature combining three overexpressed DEFRGs (ACSL1, ACSL4, TSC22D3) and two clinical variables (serum creatinine level, Gensini score) was established. The signature effectively classified patients into low- and high-risk groups. Survival analysis, ROC curve analysis, and DCA showed its robust predictive performance and clinical utility of the signature within two years after the onset of the disease. The external validation cohort confirmed the significant difference in major adverse cardiovascular events (MACEs) between the low- and high-risk groups.

The efficacy of these scores was assessed by a comparison study that measured their discrimination, calibration, net reclassification index (NRI), and decision curve analysis (DCA) over a 1-year follow-up period. Among 2532 patients with non-valvular AF (mean age, 71.7 ± 11.3 years, 58.5% men), major bleeding (MB) occurred in 91 patients (3.59%/year): 44 intracranial haemorrhage (ICH) events (1.74%/year) and 49 gastrointestinal bleeding (GB) events (1.94%/year). The best predictor for MB was the HAS-BLED score (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC], 0.674). HAS-BLED score ≥3 provided the best prediction for MB (AUC, 0.642), followed by DOAC score ≥8 and ORBIT score ≥4 (AUCs of 0.615 and 0.583, respectively). The DOAC and HAS-BLED scores did not differ significantly in discriminating MB events and risk reclassification. The calibration performance of the HAS-BLED score was superior to that of the other two scores. Decision curve analysis showed that using the HAS-BLED score to predict MB and ICH is clinically beneficial. However, there were no significant distinctions among the three models in forecasting GB. In a non-valvular AF Chinese patients receiving NOACs, the HAS-BLED score showed an ability to predict MB comparable to that of the DOAC score and superior to that of the ORBIT score. The DOAC score does not seem to be more suitable for Chinese patients than the HAS-BLED score.","2025","British journal of clinical pharmacology"

However, the role of NETs in RA-associated ILD (RA-ILD) and the mechanisms driving NET formation remain unclear. This study aimed to assess the involvement of NETs in RA-ILD and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Single-cell sequencing was used to identify changes in the quantity and function of neutrophils in the lung tissue of a zymosan A (ZYM)-induced interstitial pneumonia arthritis model. Additionally, nuclear receptor 4A3 (NR4A3) interference was performed in HL-60 cells to assess its impact on NET formation and the transformation of MRC-5 cells into myofibroblasts. The clinical relevance of plasma myeloperoxidase-DNA (MPO-DNA), citrullinated histone 3 (Cit-H3), and cell-free DNA was evaluated in RA-ILD patients with different imaging types via a commercial enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the ZYM-treated SKG mouse model, which recapitulates key features of RA-ILD, an increased population of neutrophils in the lung tissue was primarily responsible for NET formation. Mechanistically, we found that interference with NR4A3 expression enhanced NET formation in HL-60 cells, which in turn promoted the differentiation of MRC-5 cells into myofibroblasts. Clinically, plasma MPO-DNA levels are elevated in patients with RA-nonspecific interstitial pneumonia (RA-NSIP), whereas Cit-H3 levels are elevated in RA-usual interstitial pneumonia (RA-UIP) patients compared with healthy subjects. ROC curve analysis further revealed that the combination of plasma MPO-DNA, rheumatoid factor (RF), and anti-citrullinated protein (anti-CCP) and the combination of Cit-H3, RF, and anti-CCP were superior diagnostic panels for NSIP and UIP in RA-ILD patients, respectively. Moreover, compared with those from healthy controls, neutrophils from patients with RA-UIP and RA-NSIP demonstrated a significantly increased ability to form NETs and induce the differentiation of MRC-5 cells into myofibroblasts. Specifically, RA-UIP patients exhibited a greater capacity for NET formation and the differentiation of MRC-5 cells into myofibroblasts than did RA-NSIP patients. These findings suggest that targeting NETs may be a novel therapeutic approach for treating ILD in RA patients.","2025","Respiratory research"

The purpose of this paper is to explore the relationship between stress hyperglycemia ratio and the progression of non target coronary lesions. This study retrospectively enrolled patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome who underwent stent implantation and follow-up evaluations by coronary angiography at Zhongda Hospital between January 2019 and January 2024. Patients were classified into progression and non progression groups based on follow-up angiography findings. Logistic regression models, restricted cubic spline analysis, and machine learning algorithms (LightGBM, decision tree, and XGBoost) were utilized to analyse the relationship of stress hyperglycemia ratio and non target lesion progression. A total of 1,234 ACS patients were included; 29.1% experienced non target lesions progression. Logistic regression analysis showed that stress hyperglycemia ratio (SHR) was a risk factor for non target disease progression (P < 0.001), and after adjusting for other variables, SHR was still independently associated with non target disease progression (OR = 2.12, 95% CI: 1.30-3.44, p = 0.003). RCS analysis revealed a near-linear relationship between SHR and nontarget lesions progression (P = 0.14). With the increase of SHR, the risk of non target lesions progression continued to increase, and the risk was significant when the SHR was greater than 0.96, but tended to be stable when the SHR was greater than 1.36 (p = 0.0047). A hybrid model combining logistic regression and XGBoost yielded the best predictive performance, with an AUC of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.72-0.85), incorporating SHR, number and stenosis severity of non target lesions (NTLs), hypertension and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c). Subgroup analysis showed that elevated SHR was a stronger predictor of NTL progression in non-diabetic patients (OR = 3.76, p = 0.007) compared with diabetic patients (OR = 1.69, p = 0.083). Stress hyperglycemia ratio is closely related to the progression of non target lesions.

Even when the BMI was normal, visceral fat area (VFA) ≥ 90 cm² could raise the ten-year risk of developing ASCVD. Therefore, it was worth evaluating the association of influencing factors with high VF in non-obese T2DM individuals. This study enrolled 1,409 T2DM participants with T2DM, of whom 538 had a normal BMI. Based on VFA, these subjects were divided into two groups: VF (+) (VFA ≥ 90cm2) (n = 110) and VF (-) (VFA < 90cm2) (n = 428). The measurement of VFA was conducted using an Omron VF measuring device. Anthropometric and metabolic parameters were detected. Novel insulin resistance indices, such as lipid accumulation product (LAP) was calculated. Factors associated with VF were screened using univariate analysis, multifactorial binary logistic regression models and chi-squared automatic interaction detector decision tree model. The VF (+) OB (-) (BMI ≤ 23.9 kg/m2) prevalence were 7.8% in T2DM subjects (n = 1,409) and 20.4% in T2DM subjects with normal BMI (n = 538), respectively. In T2DM subjects with normal BMI, the logistic regression model suggested that neck circumference (NC) had an odds ratio (OR) of 1.891 (95% CI: 1.165-3.069, P = 0.010). The OR for VF gradually increased from the 1st to the 4th in LAP quartile (P < 0.05). LAP emerged as the root node, followed by NC in the decision tree model. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) for NC in predicting high VF levels was 0.640 for males and 0.682 for females. Optimal NC cut-off points were 37.75 cm for males and 34.75 cm for females, respectively. Additionally, the AUC values of LAP in predicting high VF levels were 0.745 for males and 0.772 for females, with optimal LAP cut-off points of 22.64 and 26.45 for males and females, respectively.

Radiomics score defined as probability class = myxoma. Logistic regression modeling employed to estimate performance of the radiomics score. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to assess diagnostic performance, and DeLong's test to assess performance between constructed models. A P-value <0.05 was considered significant. Four qualitative semantic features showed significant predictive power in class discrimination. Radiomic models demonstrated excellent differentiation of myxomas from myxoid sarcomas: AUC of 0.9271 (T1W), 0.9049 (fluid-sensitive), and 0.9179 (T1W + C). Incorporation of multiparametric data or semantic features did not significantly improve model performance (P ≥ 0.08) compared to radiomic models derived from any individual MRI sequence alone. MRI radiomics appears to be accurate in the differentiation of myxomas from myxoid sarcomas. Classification performance did not improve when incorporating qualitative features or multiparametric imaging data. Accurately distinguishing between benign soft tissue myxomas and malignant myxoid sarcomas is essential for guiding appropriate management but remains challenging with conventional MRI interpretation. This study utilized radiomics, a method that extracts quantitative mathematically derived features from images, to develop predictive models based on routine MRI examination. Analyzing over 500 cases, MRI radiomics demonstrated excellent diagnostic accuracy in differentiating between benign myxomas and malignant myxoid sarcomas, highlighting the potential of the technique, as a powerful non-invasive tool that could complement current diagnostic approaches, and enhance clinical decision-making in patients with soft tissue myxoid tumors of the musculoskeletal system. 3 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.","2025","Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI"

Single-center, prospective, observational study. Forty-six FD patients (age: 38 ± 12, females: 45.65%) and 46 sex- and age-matched healthy controls (HCs). 3 T, cardiac MRI including steady-state free precession cine imaging (during multiple breath-holds), phase-sensitive inversion recovery sequence for late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) imaging, and motion-corrected modified Look-Locker inversion recovery sequence for T1 mapping. Analysis of strains and HDF were performed on the cine imaging. HDF parameters includes apical-basal force, systolic impulse, systolic peak, systolic-diastolic transition, diastolic deceleration, and atrial thrust. Moreover, FD patients were categorized with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH+) (the maximal wall thickness >12 mm) or without LVH (LVH-). Mainz Severity Score Index (MSSI) score was calculated to measure the progression of FD. Group comparison tests, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) were performed. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. FD patients showed significantly lower native T1 (1161.1 ± 55.4 vs. 1202.8 ± 42.0 msec) and higher systolic impulse (33.8 ± 9.9 vs. 24.8 ± 9.5%). The systolic impulse in HDF analysis increased even in the pre-hypertrophic stage. The increased myocardial global longitudinal strain (r = 0.419) and systolic impulse (r = 0.333) showed positive correlations with a higher MSSI score. The AUC of systolic impulse and global native T1 showed no significant difference (0.764 vs. 0.790, P = 0.784). Increased systolic impulse and systolic peak can be observed in FD patients. Systolic impulse showed potential ability for screening pre-LVH FD patients and correlated with disease severity in FD patients. This study explored hemodynamic changes in patients with Fabry disease (FD) using hemodynamic force (HDF) analysis based on cardiac MRI. 46 FD patients were included and analysis of cardiac function, native T1, strains, and hemodynamic changes on cardiac MRI images were performed. The results showed that systolic impulse and systolic peak of HDF analysis were increased in FD patients, and systolic impulse may increase even in the pre-hypertrophic stage. Systolic impulse was correlated with disease severity in patients with FD, which may be a potential image-based diagnosis and monitoring marker in FD patients. 1 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.","2025","Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI"

Data were retrospectively collected from 176 adult patients diagnosed with Ph + ALL and treated with allo-HSCT and TKIs at The First Affiliated Hospital, Zhejiang University School of Medicine, between January 2015 and May 2023. 70% of the patients were randomly assigned to the training group(n = 124) and 30% of the patients were assigned to the validation group(n = 52). Univariate Cox regression analysis and Akaike Information Criterion(AIC) were utilized to identify significant predictive factors, leading to the development of a nomogram designed to forecast the probability of PFS at 6, 9, and 12 months post-transplantation. The final nomogram incorporated three key variables: presence of complex additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACAs), minimal residual disease (MRD) status prior to allo-HSCT, and IKZF1 gene deletions. The calibration curves showed excellent consistency between the nomogram prediction and actual observation for 6-, 9- and 12-month PFS in the training set and validation set. The C-index of the training set was 0.726(95%CI: 0.635-0.816), which was no significantly different from the validation set(C-index = 0.774, 95%CI: 0.674-0.875, P > 0.05).

This retrospective study collected data from 110 children with ASD (80 exploratory, 43 validation) and 68 typically developing children (50 exploratory, 18 validation) from two centers. The automated diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (aDTI-ALPS), fractional anisotropy (FA), cerebrospinal fluid volume, and perivascular space (PVS) volume indices were extracted from DTI, three-dimensional T1-weighted, and T2-weighted images. Intergroup comparisons were conducted using t-tests, Mann-Whitney U-test, and tract-based spatial statistics. Correlation analysis assessed the relationship between glymphatic function, white matter integrity, and clinical scales. Machine learning models based on MRI indices were developed using the AutoGluon framework. The PVS volume (p < 0.001) was larger, and aDTI-ALPS index (p < 0.001) was lower in children with ASD compared to typically developing children. FA values were reduced in the ASD group and positively correlated with aDTI-ALPS index. The aDTI-ALPS index correlated with ASD severity (r = -0.27, p = 0.02) and developmental delays (r = 0.63, p < 0.001). Mediation analysis indicated the aDTI-ALPS index partially mediated the relationship between white matter integrity and developmental delay. The MRI-based model achieved an area under the curve of 0.84 for ASD diagnosis. Analyzing glymphatic function and white matter integrity enhances understanding of ASD's neurobiological underpinnings. The multi-parametric MRI, combined with machine learning, can facilitate the early detection of ASD. Question How can multi-parametric MRI based on the glymphatic system improve early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) beyond the limitations of current behavioral assessments? Findings Glymphatic dysfunction and disruptions in white matter integrity were associated with clinical symptoms of ASD. Multi-parametric MRI with machine learning can improve early ASD detection.

We established a DCNN-assisted system and found that accuracy of diagnosis is higher than endoscopists. We prospectively collected an independent image test set of 1289 images and a video test set of 130 patients from three endoscopic centers to compare the diagnostic efficacy of 12 endoscopists before and after DCNN model assistance. Accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, time, and AUC were the main indicators for comparison. The DCNN model discriminated EGC from the control group (including ulcers and chronic gastritis) with an AUC of 0.917, a sensitivity of 93.38% (95% CI 91.09-95.12%), and a specificity of 90.07% (95% CI 87.59-92.10%) in the image dataset.

This study aims to analyze the correlation between contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) features and the risk of GM recurrence, developing a predictive model. A retrospective review included 510 patients diagnosed with GM from 2017 to 2022, divided into non-recurrence (non-recurrence, n=389) and recurrence (recurrence, n=121) groups. CEUS was conducted to assess lesion perfusion and enhancement patterns. Key features such as isoenhancement and perfusion defects were analyzed. Correlation analyses, ROC, univariate, and multivariate analyses informed the predictive model construction using XGBoost. External validation was performed to confirm model reliability. CEUS features like homogeneous (rho=0.137, P=0.002) and heterogeneous isoenhancement (rho=0.134, P=0.002) showed significant correlations with recurrence risk. Perfusion defects (rho=0.127, P=0.004) and not smooth edge lines of defects (rho=0.234, P<0.001) were also associated. The predictive model, integrating CEUS patterns, achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.822, indicating strong predictive validity.

Surgical risk models have demonstrated modest discriminative value for patients undergoing TAVI and are typically poorly calibrated, with incremental improvements seen in TAVI-specific models. Machine learning (ML) models offer an alternative risk stratification that may offer improved predictive accuracy. PubMed, EMBASE, Web of Science and Cochrane databases were searched until 16 December 2023 for studies comparing ML models with traditional statistical methods for event prediction after TAVI. The primary outcome was comparative discrimination measured by C-statistics with 95% CIs between ML models and traditional methods in estimating the risk of all-cause mortality at 30 days and 1 year. Nine studies were included (29 608 patients). The summary C-statistic of the top performing ML models was 0.79 (95% CI 0.71 to 0.86), compared with traditional methods 0.68 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.76). The difference in C-statistic between all ML models and traditional methods was 0.11 (p<0.00001).

This study was performed to investigate the risk factors for forearm swelling after transradial artery puncture and construct a predictive model. In total, 209 inpatients who underwent coronary angiography and/or interventional therapy at a tertiary hospital in Beijing between June and November 2023 were consecutively enrolled in this prospective study. The patients were divided into two groups: those who developed forearm swelling after puncture (swelling group) and those who did not (non-swelling group). The groups were compared, and logistic regression was used to identify risk factors for forearm swelling. The predictive accuracy of the model was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic analysis and the area under the curve. Among the 209 patients [132 (63.2%) men, 77 (36.8%) women], 27 developed forearm swelling. Independent predictors of swelling were the operation time, radial artery access, irregular tourniquet compression, number of tourniquet compressions, inappropriate wrist movement, and timing of the first tourniquet deflation. The predictive model achieved an area under the curve of 0.971 (95% confidence interval, 0.949-0.992).

However, the influence of preparation methods on their performance remains underexplored, especially regarding their supersaturation . To address this gap, the present study systematically investigates ASDs of ibuprofen (IBU, used as a model drug) prepared using two widely utilized techniques (solvent evaporation, SE, and melt-quench cooling, M-QC). Three different matrices/carriers (Soluplus®, SOL, povidone, PVP, and copovidone, PVPVA) were employed to evaluate the combined influence of preparation method, matrix/carrier type, and drug loading on ASD performance. Supersaturation behavior during dissolution, particularly its dependence on the Sink Index (SI), was a key focus. All ASDs showed successful amorphization, but molecular near-order structures differed based on the preparation method. ATR-FTIR spectroscopy revealed stronger molecular interactions in M-QC ASDs (compared to SE). Dissolution studies under supersaturation conditions (SI = 0.1 and SI = 0.2) highlighted significant performance differences. M-QC ASDs consistently exhibited higher in vitro AUC(0→t) values under non-sink conditions compared to crystalline IBU. Conversely, SE ASDs showed improved supersaturation primarily under low SI conditions, especially with SOL at low drug loadings. The findings underscore the need for a systematic approach in developing ASDs, considering preparation method, matrix/carrier type, drug loading and dissolution study conditions collectively. These factors significantly influence dissolution behavior and supersaturation, emphasizing that they should not be independently studied but evaluated comprehensively to optimize ASD performance.","2025","International journal of pharmaceutics"

However, the clinical application of NCTD is limited due to its inadequate hydrophilicity and lipophilicity, short half-life (t1/2), as well as adverse effects such as vascular irritation, cardiotoxicity, and nephrotoxicity. Herein, a lactoferrin (Lf) and DSPE-mPEG2000 functionalized liposomes loaded with norcantharidic acid (NCA), an active metabolite of NCTD, was constructed for the targeted therapy of HCC. In this study, blank PEGylated liposomes were prepared using the film hydration method, and the NCA was loaded by calcium acetate active loading method to increase the encapsulation efficiency (EE). Subsequently, lactoferrin was covalently coupled to DSPE-PEG2000-COOH activated by EDC and NHS. In addition, the in vivo pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics were investigated in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats and H22 tumor-bearing BALB/c mice, respectively. As expected, the encapsulation efficiency measurement showed that the encapsulation efficiency of the NCA liposomes was 89.3±1.25 %, and the coupling efficiency of lactoferrin was more than 65.97 %. Additionally, the variations in both the dynamic size and encapsulation efficiency of norcantharidic acid liposomes in long-term storage stability and serum stability studies did not exceed 10 %. Furthermore, the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics results showed that, the NCA-Lips-Lf were able to significantly improve antitumor activity by enhancing tumor-targeting accumulation and prolonging circulation time in the body compared to the sodium demethylcantharidate for injection (Na2DCA). Notably, the AUC0-48 and the t1/2 of NCA-Lips-Lf increased 4.28-time and 5.17-time in comparison to those of NCA-sol, respectively. The tumor inhibition rate of NCA-Lips-Lf (85.29 %) was significantly higher than that of sodium demethylcantharidate for injection (Na2DCA) (59.13 %), without obvious vascular irritation, cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity. In conclusion, NCA-Lips-Lf have the potential to eliminate hepatocellular carcinoma more effectively with fewer side effects than Na2DCA, which further advances the clinical application of norcantharidin-related drugs.","2025","International journal of pharmaceutics"

In this study, we focus on multisourced medical documents in the context of a population-based cancer registry in Switzerland. Although the data collection process is well-regulated, the volume of transmitted documents steadily increases and the presence of full or near-duplicates slows down and complicates document processing. Identifying near-duplicates is particularly challenging because the large number of documents makes pairwise comparison non-feasible. We implemented a system based on both normal hash functions, Simhash (Locality Sensitive Hashing), and Smith-Waterman text alignment similarity. Simhash offers good performance and confirming its results by the Smith-Waterman algorithm with a selected similarity threshold reduces the false positive rate to near zero without lowering sensitivity. Extracted differences in near-duplicate content documents are shown by highlighting differences in original PDF documents. We validated the method using 3042 manually verified document pairs containing 1252 full-duplicate and 398 near-duplicate pairs. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.96, sensitivity 0.92, specificity 1.00, PPV 1.00, and NPV 0.91. For the same size simulated data, corresponding values were 0.86, 0.72, 1.00, 1.00, and 0.77, respectively. We applied the method against 224,398 medical documents in the cancer registry. We found 5.5% of duplicates on the text level, and 0.17-0.24% near-duplicates depending on the used parameters and threshold values.

Importantly, cell lines, clinical samples (52 patients in surgery cohort and 36 in immunotherapy cohort), animal models, RNA-seq, experiments in protein and mRNA levels were conducted for identifying and validating key biomarker in LUAD immunotherapy. A prognostic signature comprising 33 LMRGs was developed and validated as an effective predictor of prognosis and TIME, with a C-index of 0.766 (95% CI: 0.729-0.804). Additionally, we identified Acyl-CoA Synthetase Long Chain Family Member 3 (ACSL3) as a potential biomarker for immunotherapy prognosis. The expression of ACSL3 was verified in 88 clinical tissues from LUAD patients, which indicated that elevated ACSL3 expression was correlated with worse progression-free survival (PFS) (p<0.001) and overall survival (OS) (p=0.008). Subsequent experiments revealed that knockdown of ACSL3 in vivo enhanced the efficacy of immunotherapy, potentially through increasing interferon α secretion, as indicated by Bulk RNA-seq and ELISA analysis, thereby promoting the infiltration of anti-tumor immune cells.

Children with average height (CAH) have elaborate general postural stability up to the age of seven years. Children with achondroplasia (ACH) face body disproportions like shorter arms and legs, bowing of the legs as well as hyperlordosis and hypokyphosis in the spine. These misalignments might affect the postural stability of children with achondroplasia. Therefore, this study aims to investigate if there are differences between children with ACH and CAH in four different bipedal static balance tasks. 23 children (11 ACH & 12 CAH) participated in this study. Every subject performed four static balance tasks: bipedal standing on the ground (eyes open/closed) and bipedal standing on a foam pad (eyes open/closed). All trials were recorded on a force plate (AMTI) with 1000 Hz and a duration of 30 seconds for each condition. Parameters of interest are the length of CoP (mm), surface area 95 (mm2) as well as three defined ranges of frequency (low: 0.02 - 0.1 Hz, medium: 0.1 - 1 Hz, and high: 1 - 10 Hz) for anterior-posterior (AP) and mediolateral direction (ML). A Mann-Whitney U test was used to investigate the parameters length of CoP (AP & ML) and surface area 95 %. One-way ANOVA was used for the area under the curve parameter for each frequency range. Nonsignificant differences were found for all parameters. However, non-significant medium and strong effect sizes were detected for certain parameters of the frequency analysis. Understanding strategies to maintain postural stability for ACH and CAH during a bipedal stance at a deeper level using frequency analysis helps to detect in which way disturbances might occur and how both cohorts react to those.

During this time, all patients with recurrent patellar dislocations received both weightbearing and nonweightbearing CT scans; control patients who received unilateral CT scans because of injuries or benign tumors received both weightbearing and nonweightbearing CT scans. Between January 2023 and September 2023, 52 patients were treated at our institution for patellar dislocation. We included those who had experienced at least two dislocations. The exclusion criteria were as follows: (1) traumatic dislocation, (2) prior knee surgery, (3) osteoarthritis (≥ Kellgren-Lawrence Grade 3), and (4) abnormal walking and standing postures confirmed by the orthopaedic surgeon and an inability to complete weightbearing CT with their body in a neutral position (meaning their body weight was evenly placed on both knees) because of severe pain. After applying prespecified exclusions, 63% (33 patients) of the original number were included, and data for 33 patients (65 knees) with weightbearing CT data and 28 patients (52 knees) with nonweightbearing CT data were obtained. Because of ethical requirements, the control group included patients who underwent unilateral CT scanning (for an injury or a benign tumor), and weightbearing CT and nonweightbearing CT covered both knees. Control knees were confirmed to have normal patellofemoral function by physical examination by an orthopaedic surgeon involved with the study. The control group consisted of the normal knees (52 knees underwent both weightbearing CT and nonweightbearing CT) and the affected but uninvolved knees (47 knees underwent weightbearing CT and 6 knees underwent nonweightbearing CT), and a total of 52 patients (99 knees) with weightbearing CT data and 31 patients (58 knees) with nonweightbearing CT data were included. There were no differences between the recurrent patellar dislocation and control groups in terms of gender, side, and BMI. Although the patients in the control group were older than those in the study group, most patients in both groups were at or at least near skeletal maturity. Patellofemoral measurements were evaluated with the Insall-Salvati ratioextension, Blackburne-Peel ratioextension, Caton-Deschamps ratioextension, bisect offset index, lateral patellar tilt angle, tibial tubercle-trochlear groove, lateral trochlear inclination, sulcus depth, and sulcus angle. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) for all these measurements were greater than or equal to 0.70 and so were considered adequate for reliability. The correlations between patellar axial malalignment and other anatomic factors during weightbearing and nonweightbearing were compared, and anatomic factors between weightbearing and nonweightbearing were compared to investigate the relationship of patellar axial malalignment and anatomic factors during weightbearing. The correlation between anatomic factors and recurrent patellar dislocation and the diagnostic performance of each factor for recurrent patellar dislocation were reported to find the anatomic factor that most strongly correlated with recurrent patellar dislocation during weightbearing. We observed several changes in axial malalignment measurements that occurred with weightbearing. The correlation between bisect offset index and Blackburne-Peel ratioextension decreased with weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.12 [95% confidence interval (CI) -0.12 to 0.35] with weightbearing versus r = 0.58 [95% CI 0.36 to 0.75]; p = 0.003). The correlation between bisect offset index and Caton-Deschamps ratioextension decreased with weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.25 [95% CI 0.03 to 0.47] versus r = 0.68 [95% CI 0.49 to 0.82]; p = 0.002). The correlation between bisect offset index and tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance increased with weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.63 [95% CI 0.43 to 0.78] versus r = 0.38 [95% CI 0.05 to 0.62]; p = 0.04). The correlation between lateral patellar tilt angle and Blackburne-Peel ratioextension decreased with weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.05 [95% CI -0.17 to 0.28] versus r = 0.44 [95% CI 0.21 to 0.63]; p = 0.02). The correlation between the lateral patellar tilt angle and Caton-Deschamps ratioextension decreased with the weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.16 [95% CI -0.09 to 0.40] versus r = 0.46 [95% CI 0.19 to 0.66]; p = 0.04). The correlation between lateral patellar tilt angle and tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance increased with weightbearing compared with the nonweightbearing state (r = 0.64 [95% CI 0.48 to 0.76] versus r = 0.41 [95% CI 0.13 to 0.64]; p = 0.048). Several parameters changed with weightbearing. In both recurrent patellar dislocation and control groups, the Insall-Salvati ratioextension and the tibial tubercle-trochlear groove distance were lower with weightbearing compared with nonweightbearing (recurrent patellar dislocation/control: p = 0.001/p < 0.001 versus p = 0.006/p < 0.001); bisect offset index was higher with weightbearing compared with nonweightbearing (recurrent patellar dislocation/control: p < 0.001/p < 0.001). In the control group, the Blackburne-Peel ratioextension and the Caton-Deschamps ratioextension were lower with weightbearing compared with nonweightbearing (p = 0.01, p = 0.007). The anatomic factor most strongly correlated with recurrent patellar dislocation during weightbearing was the bisect offset index (r = 0.73 [95% CI 0.65 to 0.79]; p < 0.001). The anatomic factor most strongly correlated with recurrent patellar dislocation during nonweightbearing was the sulcus depth (r = -0.70 [95% CI -0.78 to -0.59]; p < 0.001). The ROC analysis showed that during weightbearing, the bisect offset index had the best diagnostic ability for recurrent patellar dislocation (area under the curve [AUC] 0.93 [95% CI 0.89 to 0.97]), whereas when the patient was nonweightbearing, sulcus depth was the best predictor (AUC 0.91 [95% CI 0.85 to 0.96]). Evaluations based on nonweightbearing examinations underestimated the interaction between the tibial tubercle-trochlear groove and patellar axial alignment, thus surgeons could consider weightbearing preoperative assessments for tibial tuberosity osteotomy to avoid failing to restore normal patellar axial alignment. Bisect offset index was an important indicator to improve detecting possible recurrent patellar dislocation in the state of functional activation of soft tissues and can estimate patellar tilt to simplify the preoperative evaluation procedure. For patients who are at high risk but who have not yet developed a patellar dislocation, assessing the risk of recurrent patellar dislocation with the bisect offset index during weightbearing can inform them about the intensity and manner of their daily exercise.

We aimed to study the accuracy of common iron biomarkers compared with bone marrow iron staining in a large retrospective dataset of hematological patients. We collected from 6610 patients (median age 66 years) results of iron staining, with their concurrent ferritin, transferrin saturation, soluble transferrin receptor, transferrin, hemoglobin, and mean red blood cell volume results from Helsinki University Hospital electronic health records. In receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis, ferritin had the highest area under curve (AUC) with 88% (95% CI 86-90%) for females and 89% (87-91%) for males in predicting reduced bone marrow iron. Using a ferritin cut-off of 30 µg/L resulted in high specificity rates of 97% in females and 99% in males. However, sensitivity rates were only 54% and 35%, respectively. Other studied biomarkers had inferior AUCs. Multivariate logistic regression models did not significantly perform better in prediction compared to ferritin alone. With 50% pre-probability for reduced iron stores, a ferritin of 30 µg/L (females) and 51 µg/L (males) had 95% positive predictive value for reduced iron stores. A 95% negative predictive value was achieved at 1750 µg/L (females) and 4967 µg/L (males). In our large population study, ferritin was the best single biomarker for iron deficiency in secondary care. Adding other blood tests in a multivariate model did not improve performance. However, in these hematological patients, even a high ferritin did not rule out iron deficiency with 95% certainty.","2025","Blood advances"
508,"39841442","Polygenic Risk Score Added to Conventional Case Finding to Identify Undiagnosed Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease.","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is often undiagnosed. Although genetic risk plays a significant role in COPD susceptibility, its utility in guiding spirometry testing and identifying undiagnosed cases is unclear. To determine whether a COPD polygenic risk score (PRS) enhances the identification of undiagnosed COPD beyond a case-finding questionnaire (eg, the Lung Function Questionnaire) using conventional risk factors and respiratory symptoms. This cross-sectional analysis of participants 35 years or older who reported no history of physician-diagnosed COPD was conducted using data from 2 observational studies: the community-based Framingham Heart Study (FHS) and the COPD-enriched Genetic Epidemiology of COPD (COPDGene) study. Modified Lung Function Questionnaire (mLFQ) scores and COPD PRS. The primary outcome was spirometry-defined moderate to severe COPD (forced expiratory volume in the first second of expiration/forced vital capacity [FEV1/FVC] <0.7 and FEV1 [percent predicted] <80%). The performance of logistic models was assessed using the PRS, mLFQ score, and PRS plus mLFQ score for predicting spirometry-defined COPD. Among 3385 FHS participants (median age, 52.0 years; 45.9% male) and 4095 COPDGene participants (median age, 56.8 years; 55.5% male) who reported no history of COPD, 160 (4.7%) FHS and 775 (18.9%) COPDGene participants had spirometry-defined COPD. Adding the PRS to the mLFQ score significantly improved the area under the curve from 0.78 to 0.84 (P < .001) in FHS, 0.69 to 0.72 (P = .04) in COPDGene non-Hispanic African American, and 0.75 to 0.78 (P < .001) in COPDGene non-Hispanic White participants. At a risk threshold for spirometry referral of 10%, the addition of the PRS to the mLFQ score correctly reclassified 13.8% (95% CI, 6.6%-21.0%) of COPD cases in FHS, but not in COPDGene. A COPD PRS enhances the identification of undiagnosed COPD beyond a conventional case-finding approach in the general population. Further research is needed to assess its impact on COPD diagnosis and outcomes.","2025","JAMA"

This study aimed to develop a machine-learning model to predict postoperative infection after cytoreductive surgery (CRS) and HIPEC with splenectomy. The study enrolled patients in the national TriNetX database and at the Johns Hopkins Hospital (JHH) who underwent splenectomy during CRS/HIPEC from 2010 to 2024. Demographics, comorbidities, vital signs, daily laboratory values, and documented infections were collected. The patients were divided into infected and non-infected cohorts within 14 days postoperatively. Extreme gradient boost (XGBoost) machine-learning was used to predict postoperative infection. An initial model was generated using the TriNetX dataset and externally validated in the JHH cohort. From TriNetX, 1016 patients were included: 802 in the non-infected group (79%) and 214 (21%) in the postoperative infection group. The mean age was 61 ± 13 years, and 597 (56%) of the patientswere female. Most of the patients underwent CRS/HIPEC with splenectomy for appendiceal cancer (n = 590, 56%), followed by colorectal malignancy (n = 299, 29%).

Several prediction models have been proposed to predict PH in ILD patients. We sought to discern how previously described prediction models perform in predicting PH in patients with ILD. Patients with ILD who completed a baseline right heart catheterization, from Inova Fairfax Hospital, Northwestern Memorial Hospital, and Asan Medical Center in Korea were enrolled. The performance of various prediction models (FORD model, the FORD calculator, the PH-ILD Detection tool, and the mean pulmonary artery pressure prediction model) were assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). There were four definitions of pulmonary hypertension against which the models were evaluated. There were a total of 192 patients with ILD, of whom 32.8% (n = 63/192) met the modified 5th world symposium on PH definition of precapillary PH. Among the models assessed, the FORD calculator had an AUROC (0.733) that was marginally highest. Subgroup analysis revealed that the FORD index had the highest AUROC (0.817) in patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, while the FORD calculator had the highest AUROC (0.751) in patients with non-IPF ILD. The FORD model can be used to predict group 3 PH in both IPF patients and non-IPF ILD patients. It could serve as a tool for ILD patient selection for right heart catheterization as well as an enrichment tool for clinical trials targeting the pulmonary vasculature.","2025","Lung"

Differential analysis was performed on the gene expression profile between normal and pulpitis samples to obtain pulpitis-related genes. The co-expressed gene modules were identified by weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA). Then the hypergeometric test was utilized to screen pain-related core modules. The functional enrichment analysis was performed on the up- and down-regulated genes in the core module of pulpitis pain to explore the underlying mechanisms. A pain-related lncRNA-based classification model was constructed using LASSO. Consensus clustering and gene set variation analysis (GSVA) on the infiltrating immunocytes was used for pulpitis subtyping. miRanda predicts miRNA-target relationship, which was filtered by expression correlation. Hallmark pathway and enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the candidate target pathways of the lncRNAs. A total of 1830 differential RNAs were identified in pulpitis. WGCNA explored seven co-expressed modules, among which the turquoise module is pain-related with hypergeometric test. The up-regulated genes were significantly enriched in immune response related pathways. Down-regulated genes were significantly enriched in differentiation pathways. Eight lncRNAs in the pain-related module were related to inflammation. Among them, MIR181A2HG was downregulated while other seven lncRNAs were upregulated in pulpitis. The LASSO classification model revealed that MIR181A2HG and LINC00426 achieved outstanding predictive performances with perfect ROC-AUC score (AUC = 1). We differentiated the pulpitis samples into two progression subtypes and MIR181A2HG is a progressive marker for pulpitis. The miRNA-mRNA-lncRNA regulatory network of pulpitis pain was constructed, with GATA3 as a key transcription factor. NF-kappa B signaling pathway is a candidate pathway impacted by these lncRNAs. PCED1B-AS1, MIAT, MIR181A2HG, LINC00926, LINC00861, LINC00528, LINC00426 and ITGB2-AS1 may be potential markers of pulpitis pain. A two-lncRNA signature of LINC00426 and MIR181A2HG can accurately predict pulpitis, which could facilitate the molecular diagnosis of pulpitis. GATA3 might regulate these lncRNAs and downstream NF-kappa B signaling pathway. This study identified potential pain-related lncRNAs with underlying molecular mechanism analysis for the prediction of pulpitis. The classification model based on lncRNAs will facilitate the early diagnosis of pulpitis.","2025","Clinical oral investigations"

Understanding factors that impact islet function over time is critical. We evaluated factors associated with islet function over 12 years post TPIAT using mixed meal tolerance testing (MMTT). Insulin independence and HbA1c were assessed at each time. We compared AUC C-peptide, AUC glucose, insulin independent and HbA1c patterns over time by patient characteristics using generalized linear mixed models. 555 patients (median age 32 (IQR 17,45) years, 25% pediatric; 70% female, 41% overweight/obese) undergoing TPIAT were studied. Median islet equivalents/kg (IEQ/kg) transplanted was 3,696 (IQR 2,449, 5,494) with 26% receiving low (<2500 IEQ/kg), 43% moderate (2500-5000 IEQ/kg), and 31% high islet mass (>5000 IEQ/kg). AUC C-peptide immediately post TPIAT was lowest in those with low islet mass and remained low over time. AUC C-peptide showed a modest increase in islet function over 3-4 years in moderate/high islet mass, followed by decline (p<0.0001 for difference in post-TPIAT trajectory by group). Children have better long-term islet function particularly beyond 5 years post-TPIAT, although the difference did not reach statistical significance (p=0.0608); and overweight individuals have declining islet function long-term while those with normal/low BMI have gains in the first 3-5 years (p<0.0001). Mean hemoglobin A1c was sustained at <7% for 8 years in high islet-mass. In patients with high islet mass transplanted, islet function improves in the first several years after IAT. Islet function is sustained longer in children than in adults. Overweight/obese body habitus may be detrimental to long-term islet function, highlighting the importance of maintaining a healthy body weight for TPIAT recipients.","2025","Journal of the American College of Surgeons"

This retrospective study used data from the Finnish Randomised Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer (FinRSPC) collected between 1996 and 2020. We identified men aged 55-71 years randomised to the screening arm with PSA ≥4.0 ng/mL and a benign systematic TRUS-guided biopsy result. The cumulative prostate cancer mortality of men stratified by a PSAD cutoff of 0.15 ng/mL/cm3 was modelled with competing risk functions. The ability of PSAD, PSA, and base variables (age at biopsy, DRE result, socioeconomic status, 5α-reductase inhibitor usage, family history, and Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI)) to predict prostate cancer death was compared using c-statistics and a likelihood ratio test. After excluding 10 men without PSA data within 2 years of the biopsy and 65 without prostate volume data, 2276 men were eligible for inclusion in the study. A total of 50 men died from prostate cancer and 1028 from other causes during a median (interquartile range) follow-up of 17.4 (13.2-20.9) years. The cumulative prostate cancer mortality of men with PSAD <0.15 ng/mL/cm3 was significantly lower than that of men with PSAD ≥0.15 ng/mL/cm3: 0.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.2%-1.1%) vs 2.0% (95% CI 1.2%-3.1%) at 15 years (Grey's test, P = 0.001). The model consisting of PSAD, PSA and the base variables predicted prostate cancer mortality (c-statistic 0.781) significantly better than either the base variables alone (c-statistic 0.737; likelihood-ratio test, P = 0.003) or the base variables and PSA (c-statistic 0.765; likelihood-ratio test, P = 0.039). Prostate cancer mortality after a benign systematic TRUS-guided biopsy is low. In these patients, PSAD predicts prostate cancer mortality and provides additional value to other clinical variables.

A total of 40 volunteers received at least one dose of BGM0504 or placebo. The PK profile of BGM0504 was investigated over a wide dose range and supported once-weekly administration. It was observed that Cmax and AUC of BGM0504 were linearly proportional to the dose from 2.5-15 mg. The change in body weight (%) from baseline in BGM0504 groups was greater than that in the placebo group, with -3.24%, -6.26%, -7.09% and - 8.30% in 2.5, 5, 10 and 15 mg groups, respectively, indicating a certain dose correlation. Meanwhile, the potential roles of BGM0504 in glycaemic control were also observed. The most frequent adverse events reported were gastrointestinal (vomiting, nausea, decreased appetite, diarrhoea and abdominal distension). BGM0504 was generally safe and well tolerated with favourable PK profile and potential role in weight loss was also confirmed.

Following these procedures, they typically receive a combination of anticoagulation and antiplatelet therapy, which notably heightens their bleeding risk. However, Current scoring systems provide limited predictive capability. A total of 500 adult patients treated with anticoagulation plus antiplatelet therapy after cardiac surgery were randomly divided into the training set and the validation set at a ratio of 7:3. Predictive factors were identified using univariate logistic regression, LASSO regression and multivariable analysis. Various models were developed, validated and evaluated by using methods including ROC curves, calibration curves, the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, net reclassification improvement (NRI), integrated discrimination improvement (IDI) index, decision curve analysis (DCA) and clinical impact curves (CIC). Mod2 showed the best performance (AUC of validation set = 0.863) which consists of 8 independent predictive factors (gender, age > 65 years, diabetes, anemia, atrial fibrillation, cardiopulmonary bypass time, intraoperative bleeding and postoperative drainage), with a significantly higher AUC compared to Mod1 (only preoperative factors) and Mod3 (the HAS-BLED scoring model). NRI and IDI analyses further confirmed the superior predictive ability of Mod2 (NRI < 0.05, IDI < 0.05). Both DCA and CIC indicated that Mod2 exhibited good clinical applicability. This research established and validated a nomogram model incorporating eight predictive factors to evaluate the bleeding risk in patients who receive anticoagulation combined with antiplatelet therapy following cardiac surgery.

Histological examinations revealed reduced pancreatic inflammation and hepatic steatosis, with restored colonic structure. CPCM treatment significantly improved metabolic dysregulation in the T2DM rat model, reducing blood glucose and lipid levels, enhancing intestinal barrier function, and increasing insulin secretion. These findings highlight the therapeutic potential of CPCM in T2DM management and probiotics' role in metabolic health.","2024","Frontiers in pharmacology"

519,"39839996","An Efficient Dual-Sampling Approach for Chest CT Diagnosis.","This paper aimed to enhance the diagnostic process of lung abnormalities in computed tomography (CT) images, particularly in distinguishing cancer cells from normal chest tissue. The rapid and uneven growth of cancer cells, presenting with variable symptoms, necessitates an advanced approach for accurate identification. To develop a dual-sampling network targeting lung infection regions to address the diagnostic challenge. The network was designed to adapt to the uneven distribution of infection areas, which could be predominantly minor or major in different regions. A total of 150 CT images were analyzed using the dual-sampling network. Two sampling approaches were compared: the proposed dual-sampling technique and a uniform sampling method. The dual-sampling network demonstrated superior performance in detecting lung abnormalities compared to uniform sampling. The uniform sampling method, the network results: an F1-Score of 94.2%, accuracy of 94.5%, sensitivity of 93.5%, specificity of 95.4%, and an area under the curve (AUC) of 98.4%. However, with the proposed dual-sampling method, the network reached an F1-score of 94.9%, accuracy of 95.2%, specificity of 96.1%, sensitivity of 94.2%, and an AUC of 95.5%. This study suggests that the proposed dual-sampling network significantly improves the precision of lung abnormality diagnosis in CT images. This advancement has the potential to aid radiologists in making more accurate diagnoses, ultimately benefiting patient treatment and contributing to better overall population health. The efficiency and effectiveness of the dual-sampling approach in managing the uneven distribution of lung infection areas are key to its success.","2025","Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare"

This research explores integrating machine learning (ML) techniques to address these challenges. Specifically, the study investigates ML models for two critical aspects: (1) streamlining clinical trial design parameters (like the site of drug action, type of Interventional/Observational model, etc) and (2) optimizing patient/volunteer enrolment for trials through efficient classification techniques. The study utilized two datasets: the first, with 55,000 samples (from ClinicalTrials.gov), was divided into five subsets (10,000-15,000 rows each) for model evaluation, focusing on trial parameter optimization. The second dataset targeted patient eligibility classification (from the UCI ML Repository). Five ML models-XGBoost, Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression, and Decision Tree-were applied to both datasets, alongside Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for the second dataset. Model performance was evaluated using precision, recall, balanced accuracy, ROC-AUC, and weighted F1-score, with results averaged across k-fold cross-validation. In the first phase, XGBoost and Random Forest emerged as the best-performing models across all five subsets, achieving an average balanced accuracy of 0.71 and an average ROC-AUC of 0.7. The second dataset analysis revealed that while SVC and ANN performed well, ANN was preferred for its scalability to larger datasets. ANN achieved a test accuracy of 0.73714, demonstrating its potential for real-world implementation in patient streamlining. The study highlights the effectiveness of ML models in improving clinical trial workflows. XGBoost and Random Forest demonstrated robust performance for large clinical datasets in optimizing trial parameters, while ANN proved advantageous for patient eligibility classification due to its scalability. These findings underscore the potential of ML to enhance decision-making, reduce delays, and improve the accuracy of clinical trial outcomes. As ML technology continues to evolve, its integration into clinical research could drive innovation and improve patient care.","2025","ClinicoEconomics and outcomes research : CEOR"

Accurate preoperative identification of high-risk patients is critical for improving outcomes. To establish and validate a risk prediction and stratification model for the risk of SAEs in patients with MIE. This retrospective study included 747 patients who underwent MIE at two centers from January 2019 to February 2024. Patients were separated into a train set (n = 549) and a validation set (n = 198). After screening by least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, multivariate logistic regression analyzed clinical and intraoperative variables to identify independent risk factors for SAEs. A risk stratification model was constructed and validated to predict the probability of SAEs. SAEs occurred in 10.2% of patients in train set and 13.6% in the validation set. Patients with SAE had significantly higher complication rate and a longer hospital stay after surgery. The key independent risk factors identified included chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, a history of alcohol consumption, low forced expiratory volume in the first second, and low albumin levels. The stratification model has excellent prediction accuracy, with an area under the curve of 0.889 for the training set and an area under the curve of 0.793 for the validation set. The developed risk stratification model effectively predicts the risk of SAEs in patients undergoing MIE, facilitating targeted preoperative interventions and improving perioperative management.","2025","World journal of gastroenterology"

As the most commonly involved intestinal segment, small bowel (SB) assessment is crucial for CD patients. Yet, it poses a significant challenge due to its limited accessibility through conventional endoscopic methods. To establish a noninvasive radiomic model based on computed tomography enterography (CTE) for MH assessment in SBCD patients. Seventy-three patients diagnosed with SBCD were included and divided into a training cohort (n = 55) and a test cohort (n = 18). Radiomic features were obtained from CTE images to establish a radiomic model. Patient demographics were analysed to establish a clinical model. A radiomic-clinical nomogram was constructed by combining significant clinical and radiomic features. The diagnostic efficacy and clinical benefit were evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and decision curve analysis (DCA), respectively. Of the 73 patients enrolled, 25 patients achieved MH. The radiomic-clinical nomogram had an area under the ROC curve of 0.961 (95% confidence interval: 0.886-1.000) in the training cohort and 0.958 (0.877-1.000) in the test cohort and provided superior clinical benefit to either the clinical or radiomic models alone, as demonstrated by DCA.

In response to the current conflicting data, the present meta-analysis was conducted to assess the clinical effectiveness of C. sinensis in the treatment of RD and to provide evidence for clinical practice. Several databases, including PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang, were systematically searched updated to March 25, 2024. We used the combined ratio (OR) and diagnostic ratio (DOR) to assess the therapeutic effect of C. sinensis. In addition, risk of bias was assessed by Cochrane Risk of Bias Assessment Tool. The present meta-analysis ultimately incorporated 15 studies comprising a total of 1,310 patients with RD. We pooled estimated the sensitivity, specificity as well as DOR from patient-based analyses with 0.89 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.84-0.93), 0.69 (95% CI: 0.59-0.77) and 18.0 (95% CI: 8.0-39.0), respectively. Moreover, we calculated the combined positive likelihood ratio (PLR) as well as negative likelihood ratio (NLR) to be 2.8 (95% CI: 2.1-3.9) and 0.16 (95% CI: 0.10-0.27), respectively. Additionally, area under the curve (AUC) of the summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) was calculated as 0.88 (95% CI: 0.85-0.90) reflecting prognostic accuracy. Subsequently, subgroup analysis indicated that the clinical efficacy of C. sinensis in northern Chinese patients with RD was superior to that of southern. On the other hand, C. sinensis significantly reduced patients' blood creatinine levels, shortened the oliguria period, and increased urine osmolality, indicating it can improve the function of glomeruli and renal tubules. Our results indicate that C. sinensis can be considered a dependable clinical treatment for individuals with RD. It may improve the function of glomeruli and tubules, promote the recovery of tubular function, and thus enhance the clinical therapeutic effects. www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/#recordDetails, identifier CRD42024559042.","2024","Frontiers in medicine"

Routinely, the weights of individual SNPs are estimated by the linear regression model that assumes independent and linear contribution of each SNP to the phenotype. However, for complex multifactorial diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and others, association between individual SNPs and disease could be non-linear due to epistatic interactions. The aim of the presented study is to explore the power of non-linear machine learning algorithms and deep learning models to predict the risk of multifactorial diseases with epistasis. Simulated data with 2- and 3-loci interactions and tested three different models of epistasis: additive, multiplicative and threshold, were generated using the GAMETES. Penetrance tables were generated using PyTOXO package. For machine learning methods we used multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent neural network (RNN), Lasso regression, random forest and gradient boosting models. Performance of machine learning models were assessed using accuracy, AUC-ROC, AUC-PR, recall, precision, and F1 score. First, we tested ensemble tree methods and deep learning neural networks against LASSO linear regression model on simulated data with different types and strength of epistasis. The results showed that with the increase of strength of epistasis effect, non-linear models significantly outperform linear. Then the higher performance of non-linear models over linear was confirmed on real genetic data for multifactorial phenotypes such as obesity, type 1 diabetes, and psoriasis. From non-linear models, gradient boosting appeared to be the best model in obesity and psoriasis while deep learning methods significantly outperform linear approaches in type 1 diabetes. Overall, our study underscores the efficacy of non-linear models and deep learning approaches in more accurately accounting for the effects of epistasis in simulations with specific configurations and in the context of certain diseases.","2024","Frontiers in medicine"

Despite the escalating mortality risk observed in MHD patients, there remains a dearth of research focused on young and middle-aged individuals in this cohort, leading to a deficiency in specialized predictive instruments for this demographic. This research seeks to explore the critical determinants impacting mortality risk in young and middle-aged MHD patients and to construct a prediction model accordingly. This study involved 127 young and middle-aged patients undergoing MHD in the Blood Purification Center of Chaohu Hospital of Anhui Medical University from January 2019 to January 2022. The follow-up period for each patient ended either at the time of death or on January 31, 2024. Participants were monitored to determine their survival status and categorized into two groups: those who survived (98 patients) and those who deceased (29 patients). Clinical data were gathered for analysis. Logistic regression was utilized to pinpoint independent risk factors for mortality among these patients. Subsequently, a nomogram was established to predict mortality risk. The efficacy of this model was assessed through the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC), alongside a calibration curve and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test to examine its fit. Additionally, decision curve analysis (DCA) was conducted to ascertain the clinical relevance of the predictive model. The study incorporated 127 young and middle-aged patients undergoing MHD, with a mortality rate recorded at 22.83% (29 cases). A logistic regression analysis revealed that age, hemoglobin (HB), serum magnesium (Mg), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and platelet-to-albumin ratio (PAR) were significant independent predictors of mortality among these patients. Utilizing these variables, a nomogram was developed to predict mortality risk, achieving an AUC of 0.899 (95% CI: 0.833-0.966). The model exhibited a specificity of 83.67% and a sensitivity of 82.76%, demonstrating substantial discriminative ability. The model's robustness was confirmed through internal validation with 1,000 bootstrap samples, yielding an AUC of 0.894 (95% CI: 0.806-0.949). The calibration curve closely aligned with the ideal curve, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow goodness-of-fit test yielded a χ 2 value of 6.312 with a p-value of 0.612, verifying the model's high calibration accuracy. Additionally, the DCA indicated that the model provides a net benefit across a wide range of decision thresholds from 0 to 0.99, underscoring its clinical utility. The nomogram developed from variables including age, HB levels, serum Mg, NLR, and PAR exhibits high levels of discrimination and calibration.

Radiomics features were extracted from the area segmented which included the right and left optic nerves and chiasm. We integrated CT image features with dosimetric and clinical data subsequently, ranked 5 supervised ML models Bernoulli Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Gradient Boosting Decision Trees, K-Nearest Neighbor, and Random Forest on 4 input datasets to predict radiation-induced visual complications classifiers by implementing 5-fold cross-validation. The F1 score, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the ROC curve were compared to access prediction capability. radiation-induced optic neuropathy affected 31 % of the patients. 856 radiomic characteristics were extracted and selected from each segmented area. Decision Tree and Random Forest with the highest AUC (97 % and 95 % respectively) among the five classifiers were the most powerful algorithms to predict radiation-induced optic neuropathy. Chiasm with higher sensitivity and precision was able to predict radiation-induced optic neuropathy better than right or left optic nerve or combination of all radiomic features. We found that combination of radiomic, dosimetric, and clinical factors can predict radiation-induced optic neuropathy after radiation treatment with high accuracy. To acquire more reliable results, it is recommended to conduct visual evoked potential tests before and after radiation therapy, with multiple follow-up courses and more patients.","2025","Heliyon"

In this study, based on 62 valid occurrence records of Sphenomorphus incognitus and 24 environmental factors (19 climate factors, 4 topographic factors, and 1 human activity factor), we utilized the biomod2 combined model platform to predict suitable habitats for S. incognitus under two current scenarios (Scenario 1: natural state; Scenario 2: human interference state) and two future climate scenarios (SSP1-2.6 and SSP5-8.5) in 2050s and 2090s. The mean true skill statistic (TSS) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) suggested that the ensemble model yield more precise predictions than those of individual models. Rainfall and slope were identified as the most important factors influencing S. incognitus distribution. Human disturbance has significantly reduced suitable habitat by 44.13 × 104 km2, which is a decrease in 23.95% compared to natural conditions. Spatial analysis revealed substantial fragmentation of suitable habitat due to human activities. The incorporation of anthropogenic factors into the analysis of future climate scenarios has revealed that the area of suitable habitat exhibits divergent trends. Two distinct scenarios have been identified, each of which results in a reduction in the area of the region by 29.58 × 104 km2 and an increase by 27.04 × 104 km2, respectively, by the year 2090. The primary influence persists in human activities. The centroid of suitable habitat shifted toward the southeast under SSP1-2.6 and toward the northwest under SSP5-8.5.

Early detection of risk factors is crucial, but liver biopsy, the diagnostic gold standard, is invasive and costly. Non-invasive anthropometric indices provide a safer alternative. This study examines these indices to identify the most reliable predictor of NAFLD in adults. In the present cross-sectional study, we used the Fasa Cohort Data, conducted on about 10,000 people, of whom 1,047 were diagnosed with NAFLD. NAFLD diagnosis in this study was confirmed by physicians based on medical history and ultrasonographic evaluations, ensuring accurate and reliable identification of cases. General, anthropometric, and dietary assessments were performed using interviews, tools, and valid questionnaires. Biochemical evaluation was also done. Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), Body mass index (BMI), a body shape index (ABSI), body roundness index (BRI), and visceral fat index (VAI) were also calculated using these measurements and formulas. This study used descriptive tests, binary logistic regression, and ROC curve analysis. In both crude and adjusted models, significant associations were found between WHR, WHtR, BMI, and VAI with NAFLD. ROC analysis revealed that WHtR and BMI were the most accurate predictors of NAFLD in both genders (WHtR: men AUC = 0.750, women AUC = 0.702; BMI: men AUC = 0.754, women AUC = 0.701). BRI showed significant accuracy, but WHR (men: AUC = 0.727, women: AUC = 0.640) and VAI (men: AUC = 0.621, women: AUC = 0.622) were less effective. ABSI demonstrated poor predictive power (men: AUC = 0.530, women: AUC = 0.505) and is not recommended for NAFLD prediction. Based on the findings, BMI and WHtR emerge as the most practical and accessible indicators for early screening of NAFLD in both men and women, while ABSI shows minor effectiveness in identifying the disease.","2024","Frontiers in nutrition"

Previous evidence suggested that FGF-23 and Klotho may also contribute to the malnutritional status among these patients; however, the inter-relationship between the FGF-23-Klotho axis and PEW remains unclear. Therefore, we conducted this cross-sectional study to evaluate the association between plasma FGF-23 and Klotho levels and PEW in hemodialysis patients and to explore whether these markers could predict the presence of PEW. Plasma concentrations of FGF-23 and Klotho were measured, and their associations with PEW were assessed. PEW was evaluated based on body weight, muscle mass, biochemical data, and protein and energy intake, according to the 2008 criteria from the International Society of Renal Nutrition and Metabolism (ISRNM). In this study, 147 hemodialysis patients (mean age 61.05 ± 13.32 years) were enrolled, of whom 66 (44.90%) had PEW. PEW was significant positively correlated with FGF-23 (r = 0.403, p < 0.001), age (r = 0.225, p = 0.006), C-reactive protein (r = 0.236, p = 0.004), intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.237, p = 0.004), and single-pool Kt/V (r = 0.170, p = 0.040), while it was negatively correlated with Klotho (r = -0.361, p < 0.001), hemoglobin (r = -0.215, p = 0.009), and serum creatinine (r = -0.278, p = 0.001). Logistic regression analyses showed that plasma FGF-23 and Klotho were independently associated with PEW, even after adjusting for covariables. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of FGF-23 and Klotho in predicting PEW was 0.734 and 0.710 (p < 0.001), respectively. When the combination of FGF-23 and Klotho was used to predict PEW, its sensitivity was 81.8%, specificity was 60.5%, and the AUC was 0.746. Plasma levels of FGF-23 and Klotho are associated with PEW in hemodialysis patients. Higher plasma FGF-23 levels and lower Klotho levels may serve as valuable predictors of PEW in these patients.","2024","Frontiers in nutrition"
535,"39838708","Clinical Sensitivity and Specificity of the PROSTest in an American Cohort.","Prostate cancer (PCa) is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in men in the United States, following skin cancer, with an incidence rate of 112.7 per 100,000 men per year. The need for a reliable, non-invasive diagnostic tool for early PCa detection (screening, biochemical residual disease) remains unmet due to the limitations of PSA testing, which often leads to overdiagnosis and overtreatment. The PROSTest is a novel, blood-based qPCR assay that assesses gene expression to diagnose PCa and predict patient outcomes to different treatments. This study aimed to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the PROSTest in a diverse cohort of US-based PCa patients compared to healthy controls. This prospective study included 143 PCa patients and 92 healthy controls. Blood samples were collected, and the PROSTest was conducted following RNA isolation and cDNA production, using a predefined 27-gene algorithm to provide a binary output. The assay's sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with a 50% score cut-off distinguishing PCa from non-PCa patients. Analytical reproducibility was assessed with intra- and inter-assay comparisons of Ct values and PROSTest scores. The PROSTest demonstrated a sensitivity of 94% (95% CI 89-98%) and a specificity of 88% (95% CI 80-94%) in distinguishing PCa patients from controls, with an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.97. The false positive rate among controls was 12%. Intra- and inter-assay reproducibility was confirmed with no significant differences in Ct values or PROSTest scores between operators or assays. PROSTest scores were significantly higher in PCa patients compared to controls and in those undergoing treatment versus untreated patients. This validation study confirms the high sensitivity and specificity of the PROSTest in detecting PCa in a diverse USA cohort. The assay's robustness and reproducibility support its potential as a reliable diagnostic tool for PCa detection and monitoring. Further studies are warranted to evaluate its utility across broader populations and treatment settings.","2025","The Prostate"

The use of biomarkers to identify high-risk patients and predict PIS may provide considerable reference value in clinical decision-making. The aspartate transaminase/alanine transaminase ratio (De Ritis ratio) has been proven to be associated with specific diabetic complications. However, the association between the De Ritis ratio and PIS has not been evaluated in this population. This retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the association between the preoperative De Ritis ratio and PIS in patients with type 2 diabetes undergoing noncardiovascular surgery. Data from surgical patients were collected from January 2008 to August 2019. A total of 27,643 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) undergoing noncardiovascular surgery under general anesthesia were screened. The optimal De Ritis ratio cutoff value was identified using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Logistic regression models were used to evaluate the association between the preoperative De Ritis ratio and PIS. Propensity score matching (PSM), sensitivity analyses, and subgroup analyses were performed to further validate the robustness of this association. A total of 151 patients experienced PIS. A De Ritis ratio ≥ 1.04 was associated with an elevated risk of PIS after adjusting for baseline characteristics (OR [95% CI]: 2.25 [1.59-3.21]; p < 0.001), intraoperative parameters (2.50 [1.80-3.49]; p < 0.001), and all confounding variables (2.29 [1.61-3.29]; p < 0.001). In the propensity score-matched cohort, the association between the De Ritis ratio and PIS remained significant (2.04 [1.38-3.05]; p < 0.001). These associations were also consistently maintained in the sensitivity and subgroup analyses. An elevated De Ritis ratio is strongly associated with a higher risk of PIS in patients with type 2 DM undergoing noncardiovascular surgery. This may provide additional information on PIS risk assessment in patients with type 2 DM undergoing noncardiovascular surgery.","2025","CNS neuroscience & therapeutics"

PANoptosis, a novel proinflammatory programmed cell death pathway, has been linked to various diseases. However, the precise role of PANoptosis-related features in sarcopenia remains uncertain. According to the intersection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the sarcopenia dataset GSE167186 and the PANoptosis gene set, we classified patients into PANoptosis-related subtypes (PANRS) using consensus clustering. The DEGs of PANRS were intersected with weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA). Proteinprotein interaction network and cytoHubba algorithms were employed to further identify potential genes related to PANoptosis. The most characteristic genes were selected using LASSO regression and validated by ROC curve analysis, followed by relevant immune infiltration analysis. Additionally, small-molecule drug screening was performed using Cmap. The relative expression levels of hub genes in sarcopenia were confirmed by PCR. Finally, single-cell analysis and GSEA were used to examine the distribution and function of hub genes. Thirty-five candidate genes were identified through WGCNA and PANRS. Machine learning and ROC curve analysis revealed three core genes: LTBP2, ETS2, and H3.3B, all of which were up-regulated in patients with sarcopenia (p<0.01). Immune infiltration analysis indicated that these three diagnostic genes were linked to the activation of NK cells and macrophages. Single-cell analysis demonstrated that LTBP2 was mainly localized in fibroblasts, while ETS2 and H3.3B exhibited a uniform distribution. Enrichment analysis indicated that the three hub genes were predominantly associated with the inhibition of energy metabolism. In this study, the hub genes LTBP2, ETS2, and H3.3B associated with PANoptosis in sarcopenia were successfully identified through a combination of bioinformatics and experimental verification methods. This establishes a foundation for new candidate diagnostic and therapeutic targets for sarcopenia.","2025","Current medicinal chemistry"

Manual segmentation of the tumor components is time-consuming and poses significant reproducibility issues. We compare the prediction of overall survival (OS) in recurrent high-grade glioma(HGG) patients undergoing immunotherapy, using deep learning (DL) classification networks along with radiomic signatures derived from manual and convolutional neural networks (CNN) automated segmentation. We retrospectively retrieved 154 cases of recurrent HGG from multiple centers. Tumor segmentation was performed by expert radiologists and a convolutional neural network (CNN). From the segmented tumors, 2553 radiomic features were extracted for each case. A robust feature subset was selected using intraclass correlation coefficient analysis between manual and automated segmentations. The data was divided into a 9:1 ratio and validated through ten-fold cross-validation and tested on a rotating test set. Features selection was done by the Kruskal-Wallis test. The Radiomics-based OS predictions, generated using Support Vector Machine (SVM), were compared between the two segmentation approaches and against OS prediction by the CNN model adapted for classification. Model efficacy was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The clinical model AUC for OS prediction was 0.640 ± 0.013 (mean ± 95% confidence interval) in the training set and 0.610 ± 0.131 in the test set. The radiomics prediction of OS based on manual segmentation outperformed automatic segmentation (AUC of 0.662 ± 0.122 vs. 0.471 ± 0.086, respectively) in the test set. Robust features improved the performance of manual segmentation to AUC of 0.700 ± 0.102, of automated segmentation to 0.554 ± 0.085. The CNN prognosis model demonstrated promising results, with an average AUC of 0.755 ± 0.071 for training sets and 0.700 ± 0.101 for the test set. Manual segmentation-derived radiomic features outperformed automated segmentation-derived features for predicting OS in recurrent high-grade glioma patients undergoing immunotherapy. The end-to-end CNN prognosis model performed similarly to radiomics modeling using manual-segmentation-derived features without the need for segmentation. The potential time-saving must be weighed against the lower interpretability of end-to-end black box modeling.","2025","Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society"

Data collected included patients' general information, cognitive function, pain level, depression, and sleep quality. The dataset was randomly divided into training set and testing set, and processed by Min-Max Normalization and SMOTETomek comprehensive sampling. SVM-RFE and LASSO regression were used for variable selection. We then developed machine learning models and interpreted them by SHAP. Age, education level, number of pain sites, pain duration, pain level, depression and sleep quality were risk factors of MCI in older patients with chronic pain. The Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) model performed best (AUC 0.925), with pain level, age, and depression as the most important variables. We successfully developed 9 machine learning models to identify MCI risk. These models provide a tool for nurses to detect MCI risk early.

This study aims to investigate the predictive utility of the neutrophil-to-platelet ratio (NPR) in identifying AMI patients at an increased risk of in-hospital mortality. We enrolled 664 patients, including 421 with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and 243 with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI), at Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, from January 2020 to September 2023. NPR was calculated as the neutrophil count divided by the platelet count. The primary outcome was defined as in-hospital mortality. The overall in-hospital mortality among AMI patients was 6.78%. Mortality was notably higher in the high NPR group compared to the low NPR group. Univariate analysis identified several variables significantly associated with in-hospital mortality, including age, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), and NPR. NPR demonstrated a strong independent association with in-hospital mortality following adjustment for potential confounders. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to assess the discriminative power of NPR and NLR in predicting in-hospital mortality. NPR exhibited an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.755 (95% CI, 0.682-0.829, p < 0.001), indicating good discriminative ability. Similarly, NLR showed a discriminative AUC of 0.674 (95% CI, 0.586-0.762, p < 0.001). The optimal cutoff values for predicting mortality were determined as 0.042 for NPR (sensitivity 80%, specificity 62.2%) and 8.02 for NLR (sensitivity 62.2%, specificity 67.5%). Bootstrap validation with 1000 iterations confirmed the robustness of these findings, with validated AUCs of 0.755 (95% CI, 0.681-0.826) for NPR and 0.674 (95% CI, 0.587-0.766) for NLR. This study identifies NPR as an independent and valuable predictor of in-hospital mortality among AMI patients, The findings underscore NPR's potential utility in clinical practice for risk stratification and early intervention strategies aimed at reducing mortality rates in this high-risk patient population.","2025","Internal and emergency medicine"

Integrating quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) and morphometry can help differentiate PD from APS and improve the internal diagnosis of APS. In this retrospective study, we enrolled 55 patients with PD, 17 with MSA-parkinsonian type (MSA-P), 15 with MSA-cerebellar type (MSA-C), and 14 with PSP. Thirty-three age-matched healthy subjects served as controls. All subjects underwent QSM imaging and 3D T1WI with manual quantification of regions of interest (ROI) and morphometry. ROIs were selected in the basal ganglia and brainstem nuclei, such as the putamen (Pu), globus pallidus (GP), and red nucleus (RN). Morphometry included magnetic resonance Parkinson's disease index (MRPI), the midbrain area-pons area ratio (M/P), and the ratio of vertical line of the long axis of the midbrain and pons (Ratio). Differential variables between groups were extracted and a binary logistic regression was established to differentiate the differential diagnosis between PD and APS and between diseases within APS. The diagnostic value was assessed using the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity. The combination of Pu and GP performed best when used to distinguish PD from MSA-P, with an AUC of 0.800 (95% CI 0.664-0.936). The AUC was optimal when MRPI and M/P were combined to distinguish PD from MSA-C at 0.823 (95% CI 0.686-0.960). Ratio alone performed best in differentiating PD from PSP, with an AUC of 0.848 (95% CI 0.711-0.985). The AUC for Ratio alone in distinguishing MSA-P from PSP was 0.871 (95% CI 0.738-1.0). The AUC when using only M/P to distinguish MSA-C from PSP was 0.931 (95% CI 0.845-1.0). QSM and morphometry each offer distinct advantages in the differential diagnosis among the aforementioned groups. The combination of QSM and morphometry provided the highest diagnostic value in differentiating PD from APS, highlighting the significance of integrating these two imaging techniques for enhanced diagnostic precision in clinical practice. The best indicators described above showed equally high differential diagnostic values in patients with a disease duration of ≤ 3 years.

Four logistic regression models were developed with life-threatening events as the outcome. We started with a model of age and gender (model 1) and successively added call characteristics (calling at night and someone else calling on behalf of the patient; model 2), symptoms (cough, fever, inability to speak full sentences and wheezing; model 3), and medical history and medication use (cardiovascular and/or pulmonary; model 4). The models were internally validated using optimism correction via bootstrap with 1000 repetitions. Performance measures of discrimination (c-statistic) and calibration (calibration intercept and slope) were determined. Approximately 17% of callers with shortness of breath had a life-threatening event. Model 3 performed best. This model exhibited good discriminative ability (internal validation c-statistic of 0.764 (95% CI: 0.739 to 0.792)) and was well calibrated. All models had a high net benefit compared to using no model. Models 3 and 4 had a higher net benefit compared with models 1 and 2. As models 3 and 4 were similar in terms of net benefit, the model with fewer parameters (model 3) is preferred.

EVs proteins play a critical role in tumor progress and metastasis. However, accurately and reliably diagnosing cancers is greatly limited by single protein marker on EVs. Here, we reported an accurate diagnosis model of gastric cancer by analyzing five types of EVs surface proteins using machine learning in a retrospective study design. A washing-free detection method based on aptasensor and exonuclease Ⅰ was used to profile EVs surface proteins. The aptamer was designed as hairpin structure. The presence of target protein positive EVs converted the conformation of hairpin probes, which subsequently degraded by exonuclease Ⅰ. The exposed target protein could bind with and then open new hairpin probes, thus forming an amplification cycle. The lengths of different detection probes were optimized for detection. With the combination of five target proteins, five machine learning algorithms were compared to achieve a higher diagnostic accuracy. The best model, XGBoost, validated with 20 % of detection results could reach an accuracy of 0.8421. Furthermore, the XGBoost-based surface protein analysis could precisely identify gastric cancer patients with the area under the curve value of 0.9347 (95 % confidential interval (CI) = 0.8590 to 1.000).

Previous methods commonly focused on quantifying features from a specific sub-structure imaged at baseline and resulted in limited performance. We proposed a longitudinal MRI sub-structural texture-guided graph convolution network (LMSST-GCN) for improved KOA progression prediction. 600 KOA participants from the Osteoarthritis Initiative underwent 3 longitudinal MRI scans at baseline, 12 and 24 months. 3D nnU-net was adopted to segment 32 sub-structures of each knee on both IW and DESS sequences at each time point. 105 radiomics features were extracted from each sub-structure, mRMR was used for feature selection, and only the most representative feature was retained to characterize its texture. Each patient was encoded into a 1D vector with 192 features by concatenating all features from 32 sub-structures on the 2 sequences at the 3 time points. Then a population graph was constructed with each vertex representing each patient and edges determining their connection/similarity. The graph was further fed into EdgeGCN to generate the probability of progression. A clinical model and three kinds of machine-learning models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) were also constructed for comparison. Interpretability analysis by using GNNExplainer was conducted to explain the association between specific knee sub-structure and KOA progression. The proposed LMSST-GCN model and its variants (AUC ≥ 0.82) significantly outperformed the clinical model (AUC ≤ 0.72) and machine learning models (AUC ≤ 0.77, p ≤ 0.05 for all). Model performance benefits from the involvement of more sequences and more time points, the highest AUC of 0.85 was achieved by LMSST-GCN model constructed by using all available information. The interpretability analysis demonstrated that the loss of cartilage and sclerosis of subchondral bone at the tibial medial central region, the injury of lateral meniscus, and abnormal changes of the infrapatellar fat pad are more responsible for progression. The proposed LMSST-GCN model characterized the texture of all knee sub-structures on longitudinal multi-sequence MRI and identified patients prone to progression in the scenario of vertex classification in a population graph, providing a novel strategy for improved prediction of KOA progression.

Absolute VE was calculated using generalized additive model (GAM), generalized estimating equation (GEE), and spline-based area under the curve (AUC, measuring VE up to 6 months after the last dose of AZD1222). Overall VE (against coronavirus disease 2019 [COVID-19] hospitalization) of an AZD1222 primary series was estimated as 65% using GEE (95% confidence interval [CI]: 52.9-74.5), and 69% using GAM (95% CI: 50.1-80.9) over the 22-month study period (comparator group: unvaccinated patients). The AUC of the spline-based VE estimate was 74.1% (95% CI: 60.0-88.3). VE against hospitalization in study participants who received their second AZD1222 dose 2 months or less before hospitalization was 86% using GEE (95% CI: 77.8-91.4), 93% using GAM (95% CI: 67.2-98.6). During this study period, where mainly the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 Omicron variant was circulating, a two-dose primary series AZD1222 vaccination conferred protection against COVID-19 hospitalization up to at least 6 months after the last dose.","2025","European journal of public health"

To improve ease of testing, we validated MPS2 using first-catch, non-DRE urine. Patients provided first-catch urine before biopsy. MPS2 values were calculated using previously validated models differing only by extent of clinical data included biomarkers alone (BA; no clinical data), biomarkers and clinical factors (BA + CF), and biomarkers, clinical factors, and prostate volume (BA + CF + PV). The primary outcome was GG ≥ 2 cancer on biopsy. MPS2 performance and clinical consequences of testing were compared with PSA and the Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial risk calculator (PCPTrc). The cohort included 266 men with median PSA 6.6 ng/mL (IQR, 4.9-9.1) of whom 103 (39%) had GG ≥ 2 cancer on biopsy. The AUC for GG ≥ 2 cancer was 57% for PSA, 62% for PCPTrc, and 71%, 74%, and 77% for MPS2 models. Under a testing approach detecting > 90% of GG ≥ 2 cancers, MPS2 testing would have avoided 36% to 42% of unnecessary biopsies, as compared with 13% using the PCPTrc. In patients with a prior negative biopsy, MPS2 testing would have avoided 44% to 53% of repeat biopsies, as compared with only 2.6% using PCPTrc. Using first-catch urine, MPS2 meaningfully improved the proportion of biopsies avoided relative to PCPTrc while maintaining highly sensitive detection of GG ≥ 2 cancer. Non-DRE testing provides a convenient, objective, and highly accurate testing option to reduce the need for imaging and biopsy in men with elevated PSA.","2025","The Journal of urology"

A previous study protocol was utilized as a guideline for data collection and as the standard for the hip fracture treatment. Two prospective, detailed hip fracture databases of 2 different hospitals (hospital A, training cohort; hospital B, testing cohort) were utilized to obtain data. On the basis of the literature, the results of a univariable analysis, and expert opinion, 26 candidate predictors of 30-day mortality were selected. Subsequently, the training of the model, including variable selection, was performed on the training cohort (hospital A) with use of adaptive least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression. External validation was performed on the testing cohort (hospital B). A total of 3,523 patients were analyzed, of whom 302 (8.6%) died within 30 days after surgery. After the LASSO analysis, 7 of the 26 variables were included in the prediction model: age, gender, an American Society of Anesthesiologists score of 4, dementia, albumin level, Katz Index of Independence in Activities of Daily Living total score, and residence in a nursing home. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the prediction model was 0.789 in the training cohort and 0.775 in the testing cohort. The calibration curve showed good consistency between observed and predicted 30-day mortality. The Rotterdam Hip Fracture Mortality Prediction-30 Days (RHMP-30) was developed and externally validated, and showed adequate performance in predicting 30-day mortality following hip fracture surgery. The RHMP-30 will be helpful for shared decision-making with patients regarding hip fracture treatment. Prognostic Level II.

Recently, a deep learning model has been proposed that accurately predicts RV ejection fraction (RVEF) from 2-dimensional echocardiographic videos, with similar diagnostic accuracy as 3-dimensional imaging. This study aimed to evaluate the prognostic value of the deep learning-predicted RVEF values in patients with severe MR undergoing TEER. This multicenter registry study analyzed the associations between the predicted RVEF values and 1-year mortality in patients with severe MR undergoing TEER. To predict RVEF, 2-dimensional apical 4-chamber view videos from preprocedural transthoracic echocardiographic studies were exported and processed by a rigorously validated deep learning model. Good-quality 2-dimensional apical 4-chamber view videos could be retrieved for 1154 patients undergoing TEER between 2017 and 2023. Survival at 1 year after TEER was 84.7%. The predicted RVEF values ranged from 26.6% to 64.0% and correlated only modestly with tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion (Pearson R=0.33; P<0.001). Importantly, predicted RVEF was superior to tricuspid annular plane systolic excursion levels in predicting 1-year mortality after TEER (area under the curve, 0.687 versus 0.625; P=0.029). Furthermore, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients with reduced RV function (n=723; defined as a predicted RVEF of <45%) had significantly worse 1-year survival rates than patients with preserved RV function (n=431; defined as a predicted RVEF of ≥45%; 80.3% [95% CI, 77.4%-83.3%] versus 92.1% [95% CI, 89.5%-94.7%]; hazard ratio for 1-year mortality, 2.67 [95% CI, 1.82-3.90]; P<0.001). Deep learning-enabled assessment of RV function using standard 2-dimensional echocardiographic videos can refine the prognostication of patients with severe MR undergoing TEER. Thus, it can be used to screen for patients with RV dysfunction who might benefit from intensified follow-up care.","2025","Circulation. Cardiovascular imaging"

The minimum masking level, defined as the lowest level at which tinnitus is completely masked, is a candidate for quantifying changes in tinnitus perception. In this study, we aimed to determine minimal clinically important differences for minimum masking level. A 3-month tinnitus intervention combining counseling and sound therapy was conducted in 74 participants with chronic tinnitus. Minimum masking levels were measured at baseline and 3 months. The clinical global impression was evaluated at 3 months to measure changes in participants' self-perception of tinnitus. The minimal clinically important difference of the minimum masking level was calculated using anchored-based, effect size, standard error measurement, and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The minimal clinically important difference analysis of the minimum masking level yielded a -5.5 dB SL from the receiver operating characteristic curve, a -8.1 dB SL from the standard error measurement, a -9.2 dB SL from the effect size, and a -10.3 dB SL from the anchor-based analysis. Of these, the minimal clinically important difference value with optimized sensitivity (.704) and specificity (.957) was a -5.5 dB SL, determined using receiver operating characteristic analysis. The proposed minimal clinically important difference value of the minimum masking level (-5.5 dB SL) provides a good level of sensitivity and specificity.

However, the specific pathways and molecular mechanisms associated with GDF15 expression during MASH development remain to be fully investigated in humans. A nested case-control study comprising a MASH group of 78 individuals and three age- and sex-matched control groups (156 metabolic dysfunction-associated steatosis, 78 viral hepatitis, and 156 normal liver controls) was conducted. The baseline levels of GDF15-related transcription factors and upstream signaling pathways associated with the identified transcription factors were analysed prospectively. The significantly higher level of nuclear factor of activated T cells 3 (NFATC3), a transcription factor for GDF15, was identified in the circulation in MASH patients compared to controls. Expression of the non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway that is upstream of NFATC3, and its related proteins CTHRC1, FRZB, SFRP1, and SFRP4, were highest in the MASH group, suggesting a non-canonical Wnt signaling/NFATC3/GDF-15 cascade in MASH disease pathogenesis. A predictive model for MASH development based on four biomarkers (CTHRC1, FRZB, NFATC3, and GDF15) showed an AUC of 0.90 at 10 years. A protein-clinical model that included these four circulating proteins and BMI yielded an AUC of 0.93 at 10 years. Non-canonical Wnt signaling pathway may activate NFATC3 to promote GDF15 expression in MASH disease pathogenesis. These molecular mechanisms provide novel insights for developing targeted therapies that could modulate the non-canonical Wnt/NFATC3/GDF15 cascade to prevent/treat MASH.","2025","Hepatology international"

This study included 41 patients with iNPH and 40 age- and sex-matched normal controls (NCs). All participants underwent brain MRI. Based on DTI, we then calculated the ALPS index to obtain the water diffusivity along the perivascular space. Ventricular volume and WMH were also determined. Differences in the diffusivities and ALPS indexes between the iNPH and NC groups were investigated; associations of the DTI-ALPS index with ventriculomegaly and WMH were analysed. Patients with iNPH had a lower ALPS index than NCs (p < 0.001). The ALPS index was significantly correlated with the normalised ventricular volume (r = -0.446, p = 0.004), but not with total WMH volume (r = -0.246, p = 0.126). Further regression analyses indicated that the reduced ALPS index was associated with increased ventricular volume (β = -7.158, p = 0.016), but not with normalised WMH volume (β = -2.796, p = 0.161). The receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated the ALPS index's excellent diagnostic performance for iNPH (the optimal cut-off point = 1.322; sensitivity, 100.0%; specificity, 87.5%; AUC = 0.980). Patients with iNPH had a lower ALPS index, which may suggest impaired glymphatic function.

We retrospectively recruited 133 newly diagnosed nasal-type ENKTL patients who underwent interim [18F]FDG PET/CT scans after 2-4 cycles of immunotherapy-based treatments. Interim PET/CT was interpreted by maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax), Deauville 5-point scale (DS), and early treatment response. The prognostic value of overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) was assessed with survival curves generated using Kaplan-Meier analysis and compared using the log-rank test. Univariate and multivariate Cox proportional hazards analyses were performed to evaluate the independent effects for survival. Model performance was assessed with a time-dependent area under the curve (time-AUC), concordance index (C-index), and the Akaike information criterion (AIC). Patients with high SUVmax (> 9.2), DS 5, or with stable disease (SD) or relapsed/progressive disease (PD) on interim PET/CT showed significantly unfavorable OS and PFS with the Kaplan-Meier estimate, respectively. The interim PET/CT parameters remained independent predictors for both OS and PFS after univariate and multivariate analysis. We combined interim DS with the prognostic index for natural killer cell lymphoma-Epstein-Barr virus (PINK-E) model to stratify our cohort into 3 risk categories: low-risk (0-2 risk factors), intermediate-risk (3 risk factors), and high-risk (≥ 4 risk factors), which showed significant and superior stratifications of OS and PFS than PINK-E. Interim PET/CT after immunotherapy-based systemic treatments showed independent prognostic value for ENKTL. The model combining interim PET/CT with PINK-E might be an effective prognostic tool.

The quality assessment of diagnostic studies (QUADAS-2) tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Diagnostic accuracy measures, including sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likelihood ratio (NLR), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), were pooled. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves with the area under the curve (AUC) were generated. Meta-regression analysis was performed to explore potential sources of heterogeneity. A total of ten eligible studies including 2074 lesions in 2053 patients were analyzed. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, PLR, NLR, DOR, and AUC were 0.65 (0.52, 0.76), 0.88 (0.80, 0.94), 5.6 (3.70, 8.60), 0.40 (0.30, 0.53), 14 (10, 20), and 0.84 (0.81, 0.87), respectively. High heterogeneity was observed (I2 was 78.61% and 90.95% for sensitivity and specificity, respectively) along with a threshold effect (Spearman's correlation coefficient = 0.927, p < 0.001). Meta-regression analysis demonstrated that the MRI method (radiomics or non-radiomics) affected the heterogeneity.

The 200 patients were randomly divided into a development group (140 cases) and a validation group (60 cases). The independent risk factors for adnexal torsion from non-contrast CT signs were screened using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses. The corresponding nomogram prediction model was drawn according to the regression coefficients. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) and the calibration plots were used to estimate the discrimination and calibration of the prediction model, respectively. The most common lesion causing adnexal torsion was ovarian cyst (30.1%), followed by mature cystic teratoma (25.7%), whereas malignant tumors and tubo-ovarian abscesses were more common in non-torsioned patients. Multivariable regression analysis showed that navel sign (odds ratio [OR] 14.78; P = 0.005), whirl sign (OR 38.05; P = 0.002), and peri-adnexal fat haziness (OR 0.20; P = 0.012) were independent significant parameters predicting adnexal torsion. The AUC of the development group and validation group were 0.903 and 0.861, respectively, and the calibration curve suggested good agreement between the predictive probability and the actual probability.

Purpose To define the optimal size cutoff for a bulky lymph node (LN) on CT scans and to evaluate the prognostic value of bulky LN in the clinical N staging of lung cancer. Materials and Methods This retrospective study analyzed patients who underwent lobectomy or pneumonectomy for lung cancer between January 2013 and December 2021, divided into development (2016-2021) and validation (2013-2015) cohorts. The optimal threshold for a bulky LN was defined based on the short-axis diameter of the largest clinically positive LN at CT. Prognostic differences according to presence of bulky LN in cN1 category for overall survival (OS) were evaluated using multivariable Cox analysis. Survival discrimination was assessed using the Harrell concordance index (C-index). Results A total of 3426 patients (mean age, 64.0 years ± 9.3 [SD]; 1837 male) and 1327 patients (mean age, 63.0 years ± 9.7; 813 male) were included in the development and validation cohorts, respectively. The cutoff size for a bulky LN was established at 15 mm, and the presence of bulky LN was an independent risk factor for OS (hazard ratio [HR], 1.54; 95% CI: 1.10, 2.16; P = .01). In the development and validation cohorts, the cN1-bulky group had higher mortality risk than the cN1-nonbulky group (HR, 2.82 [95% CI: 1.73, 4.58; P < .001]; 2.29 [95% CI: 1.34, 3.92; P = .002], respectively). The bulky LN descriptor improved prognostic discrimination within the cN1 category compared with the current staging (C-index from 0.50 to 0.60 and to 0.58 in the development and validation cohorts [P < .001, P = .006], respectively]).

This study aimed to develop deep learning (DL) models based on recurrent neural networks (RNNs) for classifying skin corrosion of chemical compounds based on chemical language notation, molecular substructure, physicochemical properties, and a combination of these three properties called conjoint fingerprints. Simple RNN, long short-term memory, bidirectional long short-term memory (BiLSTM), gated recurrent units, and bidirectional gated recurrent units models, along with 11 molecular features, were employed to generate 55 RNN-based models. Applicability domain and permutation importance analysis were exploited for additional trustable prediction and explanation ability of the models, respectively. Our findings indicate that BiLSTM with conjoint features of MACCS keys and physicochemical descriptors is the most effective model with 84.3% accuracy, 89.8% area under the curve, and 57.6% Matthews correlation coefficient for the external test performance. Furthermore, our model accurately predicted the skin corrosion toxicity of all new and unseen compounds beyond our test set, highlighting prominent classification performance compared to existing skin corrosion models. This finding will contribute to the utilization of DL and conjoint characteristics of molecular structure to enhance the model's predictive capability for skin toxicity assessment.","2025","Journal of chemical information and modeling"

In this study, we compared the VirCLIA chemiluminescence immunoassay (CLIA) with the frequently used Platelia enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) on serum from hematology patients with suspected IA. Patients were categorized according to EORTC/MSGERC 2020 definitions into proven/probable IA and possible/no IA. The first cohort included 161 patients at four centers, and the VirCLIA manufacturer's cutoff of 0.200 was evaluated. Next, the optimal cutoff was determined using the Youden's index. In a second independent cohort of 189 patients from four centers, this optimal cutoff was evaluated again. In the first cohort, sensitivities and specificities for probable/proven IA were 21.1% and 100.0% for ELISA (1.0 cutoff) and 36.6% and 95.6% (0.5 cutoff), compared to 11.3% and 97.8% for CLIA (0.200 cutoff). In the second cohort, the sensitivities of ELISA and CLIA were comparable (ELISA ≥ 1.0: 33.3%, CLIA ≥ 0.200: 38.1%). The area under the ROC curve was lower for CLIA than for ELISA in the first cohort (65.0% vs 78.7%, P = 0.005) but comparable in the second cohort (79.5% vs 81.3%, P = 0.649).

We performed Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using publicly available GWAS data to assess the causal relationship between T2DM and GC, validated by heterogeneity and pleiotropy analyses. Transcriptomic data from TCGA and GEO were analyzed to identify common differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Weighted gene co-- expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to construct a prognostic risk model. Drug sensitivity and immune infiltration were evaluated using GDSC and ImmuCellAI, respectively. Additionally, gene mutation analysis was conducted using TCGA data. The Mendelian randomization analysis revealed a causal relationship between T2DM and GC at the genetic level. Specifically, the causal effect of T2DM on GC was estimated with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.32 (95% CI: 1.12-1.56), while the reverse causal effect of GC on T2DM was estimated at an OR of 0.78 (95% CI: 0.67-0.91). Sensitivity analyses, including Cochran's Q test and the leave-one-out test, confirmed the robustness of these findings. We constructed a prognostic risk score consisting of three T2DM-related genes (CST2, PSAPL1, and C4orf48) based on transcriptome data analysis. Patients with high-risk scores exhibited significantly worse overall survival (OS) (p < 0.05). Cox regression analysis further confirmed the independent predictive value of the risk score for GC prognosis. Our predictive model demonstrated good performance, with an AUC of 0.786 in the training set and 0.757 in the validation set. Gene enrichment analysis indicated that the genes shared between T2DM and GC were associated with inflammatory response, immune response, and metabolic pathways. Tumor immune microenvironment analysis suggested that immune evasion mechanisms may play a key role in developing GC in patients with coexisting T2DM. T2DM is associated with reduced GC risk. The risk score and model may help guide GC prognosis and management.","2025","Current medicinal chemistry"

However, its potential distribution remains largely unknown, posing a challenge in developing effective phytosanitary strategies. We used an ensemble model of six machine-learning algorithms including random forest, maxent, support vector machines, classification and regression tree, generalized linear model and boosted regression trees to forecast the potential distribution of A. biguttula in the present and future using presence records of the pest and bioclimatic predictors. The accuracy of these algorithms was assessed based on the area under the curve (AUC), correlation (COR), deviance and true skill statistic (TSS). All algorithms showed good performance in forecasting the distribution of A. biguttula (AUC ≥ 0.91, COR ≥ 0.72, TSS ≥ 0.77 and deviance ≤ 0.65). Mean temperature of wettest quarter, mean temperature of driest quarter and precipitation of the wettest month were the key variables that contributed to predicting A. biguttula occurrence. Projection of the model showed that cotton production areas in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America are at threat of invasion by A. biguttula under the current climatic scenario. Additionally, range expansion for A. biguttula is projected in the future in sub-Saharan Africa, South America and China, indicating a suitable ecological niche for A. biguttula to thrive.

However, significant differences persist across related studies in terms of literature quality, model performance, predictor variables and scope of applicability. This study aimed to systematically review risk prediction models for PTSD in family members of ICU patients, to make recommendations for health care professionals in selecting appropriate predictive models. China National Knowledge Infrastructure, VIP database, Wanfang database, SinoMed, PubMed, Web of Science, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature, The Cochrane Library, Embase and OVID were searched from inception to 1 May 2024. Two independent researchers conducted literature screening, data extraction and applied a risk of bias assessment tool for predictive models to evaluate included studies. The systematic review was registered on PROSPERO (registration number: CRD42024560815). Seventeen studies were included, with sample sizes ranging from 32 to 2734. Incidence rates of outcomes ranged from 1.6% to 63.6%. The most frequently used predictors were relative's female sex, longer duration of ICU stay, patient's death in the ICU and type of relationship with the patient. Two models reported area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) values ranging from 0.73 to 0.74; only three models reported calibration, and one study conducted internal validation. Overall, the 17 studies showed good applicability but exhibited a high risk of bias, particularly in data analysis. Research on predictive models for PTSD risk in family members of ICU patients is in the developmental stage. Future studies should validate existing models or develop high-performance localized predictive models. PTSD can have a significant impact on the families of ICU patients, making early identification of high-risk populations essential for health care professionals to implement timely interventions.","2025","Nursing in critical care"

Host gene expression profiling as an approach to infection diagnosis holds great potential in assisting early and accurate diagnosis of infection. To improve the precision of infection diagnosis, we developed InfectDiagno, a rank-based ensemble machine learning algorithm for infection diagnosis via host gene expression patterns. Eleven data sets were used as training data sets for the method development, and the InfectDiagno algorithm was optimized by multi-cohort training samples. Nine data sets were used as independent validation data sets for the method. We further validated the diagnostic capacity of InfectDiagno in a prospective clinical cohort. After selecting 100 feature genes based on their gene expression ranks for infection prediction, we trained a classifier using both a noninfected-vs-infected area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (area under the curve [AUC] 0.95 [95% CI, 0.93-0.97]) and a bacterial-vs-viral AUC 0.95 (95% CI, 0.93-0.97). We then used the noninfected/infected classifier together with the bacterial/viral classifier to build a discriminating infection diagnosis model. The sensitivity was 0.931 and 0.872, and specificity 0.963 and 0.929, for bacterial and viral infections, respectively. We then applied InfectDiagno to a prospective clinical cohort (n = 517), and found it classified 95% of the samples correctly.

This study aims to assess the relationship between the Triglyceride Glucose (TyG) index and GDM and explore its clinical significance. A retrospective cohort study included 631 singleton pregnant women. The study collected data on the TyG index, glucose levels, and clinical outcomes from all participants. Research objectives were validated using logistic regression analysis and Receiver Operating Characteristic curves. We found an independent correlation between TyG index and increased risk of GDM, with an odds ratio (OR) of 3.11 (95% confidence interval (CI): 2.09-4.63, P<0.001). The spline model revealed a linear association between TyG index and GDM in early pregnancy (non-linear P=0.748), and the risk of GDM increased with the increase of TyG index. In addition, we found that TyG has high diagnostic performance in predicting GDM, with an AUC value of 0.668. Combined with Age, it can improve predictive performance, with an AUC value of 0.684. Compared to the lower quartile of the TyG index, women in the higher quartile have a higher incidence of premature birth, hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, and intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP). In the GDM group, the TyG index was negatively correlated with 25 (OH) D and TBIL, and positively correlated with FBG, TG, and TC. The TyG index is strongly linked to the development of GDM and is an independent risk factor for predicting it.

In the present study, four advanced machine learning algorithms-Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-were employed to develop predictive models. The clinical data of critically ill patients transferred to the intensive care unit (ICU) post-CME were meticulously analyzed to identify key risk factors associated with the development of gastroparesis. We gathered 34 feature variables from a cohort of 1,097 colon cancer patients, including 87 individuals who developed gastroparesis post-surgery, across multiple hospitals, and applied a range of machine learning algorithms to construct the predictive model. To assess the model's generalization performance, we employed 10-fold cross-validation, while the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to evaluate its discriminative capacity. Additionally, calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and external validation were integrated to provide a comprehensive evaluation of the model's clinical applicability and utility. Among the four predictive models, the XGBoost algorithm demonstrated superior performance. As indicated by the ROC curve, XGBoost achieved an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.939 in the training set and 0.876 in the validation set, reflecting exceptional predictive accuracy. Notably, in the k-fold cross-validation, the XGBoost model exhibited robust consistency across all folds, underscoring its stability. The calibration curve further revealed a favorable concordance between the predicted probabilities and the actual outcomes of the XGBoost model. Additionally, the DCA highlighted that patients receiving intervention under the XGBoost model experienced significantly greater clinical benefit. The onset of postoperative gastroparesis in colon cancer patients remains an elusive challenge to entirely prevent.

The blood urea nitrogen-to-albumin ratio (BAR) is a comprehensive parameter associated with inflammation status; however, it is unknown whether the BAR can predict the prognosis of IPF. This retrospective study included 176 patients with IPF, and 1-year all-cause mortality of these patients was recorded. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to explore the diagnostic value of BAR for 1-year all-cause mortality in IPF patients, and the survival rate was further estimated using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve. Cox proportional hazards regression model and forest plot were used to assess the association between the BAR and 1-year all-cause mortality in IPF patients. The BAR of IPF patients was significantly higher in the non-survivor group than in the survivor group [0.16 (0.13-0.23) vs. 0.12 (0.09-0.17) mmol/g, p = 0.002]. The area under the ROC curve for predicting 1-year all-cause mortality in IPF patients was 0.671, and the optimal cut-off value was 0.12 mmol/g. The Kaplan-Meier survival curve showed that the 1-year cumulative survival rate of IPF patients with a BAR ≥0.12 was significantly decreased compared with the patients with a BAR <0.12. The Cox regression model and forest plot showed that the BAR was an independent prognostic biomarker for 1-year all-cause mortality in IPF patients (HR = 2.778, 95% CI 1.020-7.563, p = 0.046). The BAR is a significant predictor of 1-year all-cause mortality of IPF patients, and high BAR values may indicate poor clinical outcomes.","2024","Frontiers in medicine"

This study compared the performance of traditional logistic regression and machine learning models in predicting adult sepsis mortality. To develop an optimum model for predicting the mortality of adult sepsis patients based on comparing traditional logistic regression and machine learning methodology. Retrospective analysis was conducted on 606 adult sepsis inpatients at our medical center between January 2020 and December 2022, who were randomly divided into training and validation sets in a 7:3 ratio. Traditional logistic regression and machine learning methods were employed to assess the predictive ability of mortality in adult sepsis. Univariate analysis identified independent risk factors for the logistic regression model, while Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression facilitated variable shrinkage and selection for the machine learning model. Among various machine learning models, which included Bagged Tree, Boost Tree, Decision Tree, LightGBM, Naïve Bayes, Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Random Forest (RF), the one with the maximum area under the curve (AUC) was chosen for model construction. Model validation and comparison with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) and the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE) scores were performed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) curves in the validation set. Univariate analysis was employed to assess 17 variables, namely gender, history of coronary heart disease (CHD), systolic pressure, white blood cell (WBC), neutrophil count (NEUT), lymphocyte count (LYMP), lactic acid, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), red blood cell distribution width (RDW), interleukin-6 (IL-6), prothrombin time (PT), international normalized ratio (INR), fibrinogen (FBI), D-dimer, aspartate aminotransferase (AST), total bilirubin (Tbil), and lung infection. Significant differences (p < 0.05) between the survival and non-survival groups were observed for these variables. Utilizing stepwise regression with the ""backward"" method, independent risk factors, including systolic pressure, lactic acid, NLR, RDW, IL-6, PT, and Tbil, were identified. These factors were then incorporated into a logistic regression model, chosen based on the minimum Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) value (98.65). Machine learning techniques were also applied, and the RF model, demonstrating the maximum Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.999, was selected. LASSO regression, employing the lambda.1SE criteria, identified systolic pressure, lactic acid, NEUT, RDW, IL6, INR, and Tbil as variables for constructing the RF model, validated through ten-fold cross-validation. For model validation and comparison with traditional logistic models, SOFA, and APACHE scoring. Based on deep machine learning principles, the RF model demonstrates advantages over traditional logistic regression models in predicting adult sepsis prognosis.

This study explored the molecular mechanism and potential targets of IA rupture through bioinformatics methods. The gene expression matrices of GSE13353, GSE122897, and GSE15629 were downloaded. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened using the limma package. Functional enrichment analysis was performed, and a PPI network was constructed. Furthermore, candidate key genes were identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression model, support vector machine-recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) analysis, and PPI network analysis. ROC analysis was conducted to further verify the diagnostic value of the key genes. A total of 334 DEGs were screened, including 175 upregulated genes and 159 downregulated genes. Further functional analysis suggested that the DEGs were enriched in inflammation and immune response pathways. Fourteen hub genes were identified using the two algorithms. The PPI networks of the hub genes were analyzed using the Cytoscape plugin CytoNCA to obtain two key genes (IL10 and Integrin α5 (ITGA5)). The ROC curve analysis showed that the AUC values of IL10 and ITGA5 were 0.801, and 0.786, respectively. In addition, the two key genes were significantly positively correlated with macrophages and Treg (T) cells. The immune score and ESTIMATE score of the ruptured IA group were significantly higher than those of the unruptured IA group. The increase in IL-10 and ITGA5 may weaken the vascular wall by promoting inflammation in blood vessels and immune cells, which could have a harmful effect on the rupture of IAs.","2024","Frontiers in medicine"

This study aimed to assess the utility of the ORi/FiO2 ratio as an index for quantifying F-shunt, serving as an estimate of venous admixture. Anesthetic records were reviewed from 44 dogs undergoing general anesthesia and requiring arterial catheterization. ORi was measured via a CO-oximeter using a probe on the tongue. Paired measurements of PaO2, obtained by blood gas analysis, and ORi were taken at various FiO2 levels to achieve an ORi between 0 and 1. Venous admixture was quantified by F-shunt. Spearman's correlation coefficient assessed the relationship between ORi/FiO2 and F-shunt. Youden's index identified the optimal cut-off point to predict a physiological F-shunt (≤ 10%). A total of 77 paired observations were collected, revealing a moderate negative correlation between F-shunt and ORi/FiO2 (rho = -0.59, p < 0.001). An ORi/FiO2 cut-off of 1.2 demonstrated 80% sensitivity for identifying dogs with an F-shunt ≤10%, with a ROC curve area above 80%. However, the index was less effective at distinguishing dogs with higher shunt fractions. The ORi/FiO2 index identifies dogs with low F-shunt during anesthesia with strong sensitivity and predictive accuracy, potentially ruling out the occurrence of ventilation-perfusion inequality.

Portal hypertension, the most common outcome of cirrhosis progression, has a high incidence. Platelet count/spleen diameter ratio (PSL) with a cut-off value of 909 can predict the presence of esophagogastric varices and thus portal hypertension, which is also an independent risk factor for early recurrence and late recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma after resection. Therefore, the effect of PSL on the overall survival (OS) of patients with HCC is necessary. The aim of this study was to apply a new method to establish and validate a model for predicting the prognosis of patients based on PSL with HCC. A total of 1,104 patients with clinical diagnosed with HCC following non-surgical therapy randomly divided the patients into a primary cohort and a validation cohort in a ratio of 7:3, in which 772 HCC patients were in the primary cohort and a total of 332 HCC patients were in the validation cohort. Through Lasso-Cox analysis, the independent predictors of OS of training cohort were included in nomogram1, and the independent predictors of Cox regression analysis were included in nomogram2. Nomogram1 and nomogram2 used consistency index (C-index), AUC and time-dependent ROC curves in the training cohort, respectively, and the calibration curves were plotted. All suggest that nomogram1 is better than nomogram2. We get similar results in the validation cohort. The C-index of nomogram1was 0.792 (95%CI: 0.772-0.812), which was superior to nomogram2 (0.788) and traditional modes (0.631-0.712). The AUC of nomogram1 was 0.866 (95%CI: 0.840-0.889).

They were divided into four groups (Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4) based on the quartiles of TyG, TyG-BMI, TyGWC and TyGWHtR in the baseline data. A Cox proportional hazard model was used to analyze the risk of MCD associated with TyG and its obesity-related combined indicators. Dose-response relationships were analyzed using restricted cubic spline regression, and the predictive ability for detection of MCD was analyzed using ROC curve. At the end of the follow-up in 2015, 473 new cases of MCD were observed among the study population, with an incidence rate of 15.6%. After adjusting for confounding factors, the risk of MCD significantly increased in the Q4 TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC and TyG-WHtR index groups compared to the Q1 groups (p<0.001 in all cases). A linear dose-response relationship was observed between the TyG index and the risk of MCD, indicating increased risks of CKD with higher TyG indexes. However, the TyG-BMI, TyG-WC and TyG-WHtR indexes exhibited nonlinear dose-response relationships with the risk of MCD (P-nonlinearity <0.0001 in all cases), indicating higher indexes were associated with higher risks of MCD. The areas under the ROC curves for the Cox regression models of TyG, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC and TyG-WHtR indices were 0.610, 0.590, 0.590 and 0.607, respectively.

The lightGBM algorithm was used to develop prediction model and assessed by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. The LightGBM model was then externally validated in 36395 RCC patients enrolled from the SEER database between 2016 and 2018. Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) method was applied to provide insights into the model's outcome or prediction. Of 121433 patients involved in the study cohort, 10730 (8.84%) had distant metastasis. The LightGBM model showed good performance in the internal validation set (AUC: 0.955, 95% CI: 0.951-0.959) and temporal external validation sets (0.963, 95% CI: 0.959-0.967; 0.961, 95% CI: 0.954-0.966). Performance for the prediction model was also well performed in different sub-cohort stratified by age, gender, and ethnicity. The calibration curve indicated that the predicted values are highly consistent with the actual observed values. SHAP plots demonstrated that chemotherapy was the most vital variable for prediction of distant metastasis of RCC patients.

Performance ranged from 89.88% to 90.10% (95.98 ± 3.32%) in the learning dataset and from 69.15% to 91.14% (83.65 ± 8.24%) in the testing dataset. These results are good considering the difficult, realistic multiclass classification task. The proposed multiclass neural network constructed using the AdvRS&LP represents a promising deep-learning tool for discriminating several cardiac diseases while ensuring clinical interpretability.","2025","Heliyon"
581,"39834417","Towards personalized cardiometabolic risk prediction: A fusion of exposome and AI.","The influence of the exposome on major health conditions like cardiovascular disease (CVD) is widely recognized. However, integrating diverse exposome factors into predictive models for personalized health assessments remains a challenge due to the complexity and variability of environmental exposures and lifestyle factors. A machine learning (ML) model designed for predicting CVD risk is introduced in this study, relying on easily accessible exposome factors. This approach is particularly novel as it prioritizes non-clinical, modifiable exposures, making it applicable for broad public health screening and personalized risk assessments. Assessments were conducted using both internal and external validation groups from a multi-center cohort, comprising 3,237 individuals diagnosed with CVD in South Korea within twelve years of their baseline visit, along with an equal number of participants without these conditions as a control group. Examination of 109 exposome variables from participants' baseline visits spanned physical measures, environmental factors, lifestyle choices, mental health events, and early-life factors. For risk prediction, the Random Forest classifier was employed, with performance compared to an integrative ML model using clinical and physical variables. Furthermore, data preprocessing involved normalization and handling of missing values to enhance model accuracy. The model's decision-making process were using an advanced explainability method. Results indicated comparable performance between the exposome-based ML model and the integrative model, achieving AUC of 0.82(+/-)0.01, 0.70(+/-)0.01, and 0.73(+/-)0.01. The study underscores the potential of leveraging exposome data for early intervention strategies. Additionally, exposome factors significant in identifying CVD risk were pinpointed, including daytime naps, completed full-time education, past tobacco smoking, frequency of tiredness/unenthusiasm, and current work status.","2025","Heliyon"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of organic amendment on the soil microbial community within a saline gradient. The study was designed with five levels of electrical conductivity (EC): 0.33, 0.62, 1.13, 1.45 and 2.04 ds m-1. By conducting indoor potted plant experiments, determine the effects of applying microbial organic fertilizer on the physicochemical properties of soil and the structure of soil microbial communities under different salinity concentrations. Compared with the control, higher OM content, total N, and higher crop biomass were observed in samples with organic amendment at the same salinity level. At the same salinity levels, the mean bacterial activity (AUC) and the mean number of substrates were higher than in the soil without organic amendment according to analyses by means of Biolog ECO MicroPlate. The results of canonical correspondence analysis indicate that after the application of organic amendments, the composition of loam and clay replaces soil pH, and aboveground biomass replaces root biomass as key indicators closely monitoring Community level physiological profiling (CLPP). In soil with the same salinity level, the application of microbial organic fertilizer led to an increase in the proportion of Actinobacteriota and a decrease in the proportion of Chloroflexi. In 0.3dS m-1 soil, the abundance of actinomycetes increased from 23% to 27% after application of microbial organic fertilizer, while the abundance of basidiomycetes decreased from 20% to 6%. In addition, after the application of microbial organic fertilizer, RB41, blastococcus and solirubrobacter significantly increased, while Melothermus and Herpetosiphon significantly decreased. This study provides a strong theoretical basis for using microbial organic fertilizers to improve saline-alkali soil.","2024","Frontiers in microbiology"

Forty Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly assigned to five groups (n = 8/group) using a random number table: normal control, T2DM model, electroacupuncture (EA), EA + antibiotics (EA + A), and antibiotics (A). The normal rats received a standard diet and saline gavage, while the other groups were fed a high-fat diet and emulsion. The EA + A and A groups received additional antibiotic solution gavage. The normal, model, and A groups were immobilized and restrained for 30 min, six times per week, for 4 weeks. The EA and EA + A groups received EA treatment at specific acupoints for 30 min, six times per week, for 4 weeks. EA parameters were continuous waves at 10 Hz and 1-2 mA. During the intervention, water and food consumption, body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were monitored. Pancreatic tissue was examined using hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining. Fecal microbial communities were analyzed by 16S rDNA sequencing, and short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Serum levels of fasting insulin (FINS), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). EA significantly improved daily water intake, food consumption, and body weight in T2DM rats (p < 0.01). EA also reduced FBG, the area under the curve of the OGTT, FINS, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) in T2DM rats (p < 0.05). The ELISA results showed a lower concentration of HbA1c in the EA group (p < 0.05). EA improved the overall morphology and area of pancreatic islets, increased the number of β-cell nuclei, and alleviated β-cell hypertrophy. The abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the EA group increased than the model group (p < 0.05), and EA upregulated the Shannon, Chao1, and Ace indices (p < 0.05). EA increased the concentrations of acetic acid, butyric acid, and GLP-1 (p < 0.05). Correlation analysis revealed negative associations between Lactobacillaceae (R = -0.81, p = 0.015) and Lactobacillus (R = -0.759, p = 0.029) with FBG. Peptostreptococcaceae and Romboutsia were negatively correlated with HbA1c (R = -0.81, p = 0.015), while Enterobacteriaceae was positively correlated with OGTT (R = 0.762, p = 0.028).

We analyzed data from the Japanese Adverse Drug Event Report database from April 2004 to November 2023. Cases involving oral SGAs, excluding clozapine, were extracted. We used the odds ratios to assess the reporting proportions among SGAs and sex, analyzed the median time-to-onset and interquartile ranges (IQRs), and conducted a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis to investigate the time-to-onset of dystonia and its relationship to outcomes. We extracted 9837 cases involving oral SGAs. Lurasidone was associated with a significantly higher proportion of dystonia reports than risperidone, aripiprazole, quetiapine, and olanzapine. The reporting proportion of dystonia associated with aripiprazole was lower than that of paliperidone and risperidone, but higher than that of quetiapine and olanzapine. Female sex was significantly associated with a higher reporting proportion of dystonia compared with males. Among the 148 cases of oral SGA-induced dystonia, the median time-to-onset was 125 days (IQR, 19.75-453.25 days). Divided into the three outcome groups (recovered, improved, and unrecovered/residual), those with better outcomes had a shorter time-to-onset than those with poorer outcomes. ROC curve analysis suggested a threshold of 91.5 days for discriminating outcomes, with a sensitivity of 71.7% and specificity of 69.9%. The risks of dystonia may vary among SGAs and between sexes.

Prospective cohort study. Academic referral center. Plasma and tumor samples were prospectively collected from patients with nonradiated, sporadic VS undergoing microsurgical resection from July 2022 to June 2023. Plasma MMP-9 levels were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and their association with tumor adherence and postoperative outcomes were evaluated. Thirty-three patients undergoing microsurgical resection agreed to participate (15 females, median age 54 years old, median tumor size 26.7 mm). A gross total resection (GTR) was performed in 18 patients (55%), and a near-total (NTR)/subtotal resection (STR) in 15 (45%). Tumor size was not significantly different between the GTR and NTR/STR groups (20.7 vs 24.8 mm, P= .185). Intraoperatively, a larger fraction of NTR/STR tumors were highly adherent to the brainstem and/or cranial nerves (93% vs 56%, P = .015). Preoperative plasma MMP-9 was higher in patients who underwent an NTR/STR compared to a GTR (229.9 vs 131.2ng/mL, P = .007). On multivariable logistic regression, preoperative plasma MMP-9 strongly predicted EOR by receiver operating characteristic analysis (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.77 P = .008). Combining plasma MMP-9 and age was an excellent predictor of EOR (AUC = 0.91, P = .0001). Plasma MMP-9 levels strongly predicted intraoperative tumor adherence and postoperative extent of resection. This could provide crucial preoperative insights into surgical difficulty, potential complications, and the likelihood of gross total tumor removal, enhancing informed decision-making for both physicians/surgeons and patients.","2025","Otolaryngology--head and neck surgery : official journal of American Academy of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery"

A total of 70 patients with MS/clinically isolated syndrome and 50 age- and sex-matched patients with migraine underwent a 3-T magnetic resonance imaging scan. The CVS was evaluated according to current guidelines, excluding eight patients with migraine who did not show white matter (WM) lesions. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was performed to identify the best threshold in terms of proportion of CVS+ lesions and the absolute number of CVS+ lesions able to differentiate MS from migraine. Lesion volume was different between CVS+ and CVS negative lesions (median 1043 vs. 176.5 mm3 for MS cohort; median 35.1 vs. 52.2 mm3 for migraine cohort; p < 0.001 for all). A higher proportion of CVS+ lesions was associated with a higher probability of being diagnosed as MS (adjusted odds ratio 1.09, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.04-1.14; p < 0.001). CVS+ lesion volume and number were higher in MS with respect to migraine, both considering the whole brain and its subregions (p < 0.001). The proportion of CVS+ lesions in juxtacortical and infratentorial areas was higher in MS than in migraine (p = 0.015 and p = 0.034, respectively).

The risk of 1-year mortality was estimated in patients with severe HF enrolled in the HELP-HF cohort according to the MAGGIC, 3-CHF, ADHF/NT-proBNP, and GWTG-HF risk scores, the number of criteria of the 2018 HFA-ESC definition of advanced HF, I NEED HELP markers, domains fulfilled of the 2019 HFA-ESC definition of frailty, the frailty index, and the INTERMACS profile. In addition, we tested the performance of different machine learning (ML)-based models to predict 1-year mortality. At 1-year follow-up, 265 patients (23.1%) died. The prognostic accuracy, tested in the subgroup of patients with completeness of all data regarding the variables included in the scores (497/1149 patients), resulted moderate for MAGGIC, GWTG-HF, and ADHF/NT-proBNP scores (area under the curve [AUC] ≥0.70) and only poor for the other tools. All the scores lost accuracy in estimating the rate of 1-year mortality in patients at the highest risk. Support vector machine-based model had the best AUC among ML-based models, slightly outperforming most of the tested risk scores. Most of the scores used to predict the risk of mortality in HF performed poorly in real-world patients with severe HF and provided inaccurate estimate of the risk of 1-year mortality in patients at the highest risk. ML-based models did not significantly outperform the currently available risk scores and their use must be validated in large cohort of patients.","2025","European journal of heart failure"

A deep learning model was developed to predict outcomes based on modified Rankin Scale scores using pretherapy clinical data collected from admission to the initiation of physical therapy. The model's performance was assessed using the area under the curve, and interpretability was enhanced using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Logistic regression analysis was also performed for further validation. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the model was 0.90, with age, World Federation of Neurosurgical Societies grade, and higher brain dysfunction identified as key predictors.

Previous research has demonstrated that PLTP can exert anti-inflammatory effects and improve individual survival in patients with sepsis and endotoxemia by neutralizing LPS and facilitating LPS clearance. However, the role of PLTP in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury (SA-AKI) and the specific mechanism of its protective effects are unclear. This study aimed to assess the potential role of PLTP in SA-AKI. This is a population-based prospective observational study of patients with sepsis admitted to the intensive care unit. Blood samples were collected on days 1, 3, 5, and 7 after admission to the ICU. Plasma PLTP lipotransfer activity was measured to assess outcomes, including the incidence of SA-AKI and 30-day major adverse kidney events (MAKE 30). The correlation between PLTP lipotransfer activity and SA-AKI and MAKE 30 was evaluated through logistic regression modeling. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the diagnostic value of PLTP lipotransfer activity for SA-AKI and MAKE 30. The PLTP lipotransfer activity was categorized into high and low groups based on the optimal cut-off values. The differences between the high and low PLTP lipotransfer activity groups in terms of MAKE 30 were evaluated using Kaplan-Meier analysis. The SA-AKI mouse model was established via cecum ligation and puncture (CLP) in the animal experimental phase. The impact of PLTP on renal function was then investigated in wild-type and PLTP ± mice. The wild-type mice were given recombinant human PLTP (25 μg, 200 μL each/dose) via the tail vein at 1-, 7-, and 23-h intervals on the day preceding CLP. The control group received an equal volume of solvent. The 10-day survival and kidney function among the treatment groups were then evaluated. A total of 93 patients were enrolled in this clinical trial, of which 52 developed acute kidney injury (AKI). A total of 32 patients died over the course of the 30-day follow-up period, 34 underwent kidney replacement therapy, 37 developed persistent acute kidney injury, and 55 patients met the composite endpoint. The plasma PLTP lipotransfer activity was identified as an independent predictor of SA-AKI (crude OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.95-0.98, p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 0.92, 95% CI 0.86-0.96, p = 0.001) and MAKE 30 (crude OR = 0.97, 95% CI 0.96-0.98, p < 0.001; adjusted OR = 0.96, 95% CI 0.93-0.98, p = 0.001). The area under the curve (AUC) of plasma PLTP lipotransfer activity within 24 h of ICU admission could predict the occurrence of SA-AKI and MAKE 30 in septic patients (AUC values; 0.87 (95% CI 0.79-0.94) and 0.87 (95% CI 0.80-0.94), respectively). The cumulative incidence of main kidney adverse events was significantly lower in the high group than in the low group (p < 0.001). Compared with the controls, creatinine levels were significantly elevated in the CLP mice, while PLTP lipotransfer activity was significantly decreased at 24 h postoperatively. Moreover, the PTLP ± mice exhibited significantly impaired renal function and markedly elevated plasma levels of inflammatory mediators compared with the wild-type CLP mice. Notably, human recombinant PTLP significantly prolonged 10-day survival, improved renal function, and attenuated mitochondrial structural damage in wild-type CLP mice. These findings indicate that PLTP is a potential therapeutic target in sepsis-associated acute kidney injury.","2025","Critical care (London, England)"

This study aims to develop and validate an encrypted multidimensional radiomics approach to enhance the stratification and analysis of therapeutic responses. This multicenter study incorporated various data types from 506 NSCLC patients, which underwent preprocessing through anonymization methods and were securely encrypted using the AES-CBC algorithm. We developed one clinical model and three radiomics models based on clinical factors and radiomics scores (RadScore) of three distinct regions to evaluate treatment response. Additionally, an integrated radiomics-clinical model was created by combining clinical factors with RadScore. The study also explored the association between different EGFR mutations and PD-1/PD-L1 expression in radiomics biomarkers. The radiomics-clinical model demonstrated high performance, with AUC values as follows: EGFR (0.884), 19Del (0.894), L858R (0.881), T790M (0.900), and PD-1/PD-L1 expression (0.893) in the test set. This model outperformed both clinical and single radiomics models. Decision curve analysis further supported its superior clinical utility. Additionally, our findings suggest that the efficacy of EGFR-TKIs and ICIs therapy may not depend on detecting a singular tumor feature or cell type. The proposed method effectively balances the level of evidence with privacy protection, enhancing the study's validity and security.

Despite the presence of numerous bioinformatic algorithms for estimating mutation pathogenicity, there is significant variation in their assessments. This inconsistency is evident even for well-established cancer driver mutations. This study aims to develop an ensemble machine learning approach to evaluate the performance (rank) of pathogenic and conservation scoring algorithms (PCSAs) based on their ability to distinguish pathogenic driver mutations from benign passenger (non-driver) mutations in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSC). The study used a dataset from 502 HNSC patients, classifying mutations based on 299 known high-confidence cancer driver genes. Missense somatic mutations in driver genes were treated as driver mutations, while non-driver mutations were randomly selected from other genes. Each mutation was annotated with 41 PCSAs. Three machine learning algorithms-logistic regression, random forest, and support vector machine-along with recursive feature elimination, were used to rank these PCSAs. The final ranking of the PCSAs was determined using rank-average-sort and rank-sum-sort methods. The random forest algorithm emerged as the top performer among the three tested ML algorithms, with an AUC-ROC of 0.89, compared to 0.83 for the other two, in distinguishing pathogenic driver mutations from benign passenger mutations using all 41 PCSAs. The top 11 PCSAs were selected based on the first quintile cut-off from the final rank-sum distribution. Classifiers built using these top 11 PCSAs (DEOGEN2, Integrated_fitCons, MVP, etc.) demonstrated significantly higher performance (p-value < 2.22e-16) compared to those using the remaining 30 PCSAs across all three ML algorithms, in separating pathogenic driver from benign passenger mutations. The top PCSAs demonstrated strong performance on a validation cohort including independent HNSC and other cancer types: breast, lung, and colorectal - reflecting its consistency, robustness and generalizability. The ensemble machine learning approach effectively evaluates the performance of PCSAs based on their ability to differentiate pathogenic drivers from benign passenger mutations in HNSC and other cancer types. Notably, some well-known PCSAs performed poorly, underscoring the importance of data-driven selection over relying solely on popularity.","2025","BioData mining"

This study evaluated the accuracy of fluorescence imaging technology in rapidly distinguishing tumours from nontumour tissue during surgery, thus providing real-time feedback to surgeons and optimizing the surgical workflow. Biopsy samples from 65 patients were selected for this study. The lesion tissues were sequentially stained with sodium fluorescein and methylene blue, followed by fluorescence imaging via a handheld EndoScell scanner under an intraoperative cellular microscope. Frozen section examinations and haematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining were performed on the same lesion tissue by the pathology department. The time required for fluorescence imaging and pathology of frozen sections was recorded. The results of fluorescence imaging (whether the tissue was a tumour or nontumour tissue) and frozen pathology (whether the tissue was a tumour or nontumour tissue) were also recorded. The HE staining results were used as the final gold standard for diagnosis. The sensitivity, specificity, area under the curve (AUC), Kappa consistency test, and diagnostic efficiency of both methods were calculated. Lesion tissue and diagnostic results were successfully obtained from all 65 patients. When HE-stained histopathology was used as the gold standard, the sensitivity of fluorescence imaging was 100% (95% CI: 0.917-1.000), and the specificity was 63.6% (95% CI: 0.316-0.876). In comparison, the sensitivity of frozen section pathology was 88.9% (95% CI: 0.767-0.954), and the specificity was 100% (95% CI: 0.679-1.000). Both methods demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy. ROC curve analysis revealed that the AUCs for fluorescence imaging and frozen pathology were 0.818 and 0.944, respectively, with no significant difference observed in diagnostic performance (Z = 1.597, P > 0.05). Kappa consistency tests indicated that the Kappa value for frozen pathology compared with HE staining was 0.730 (P < 0.001); for fluorescence imaging compared with HE staining, the Kappa value was 0.744 (P < 0.001), thus demonstrating strong agreement with the HE staining results for both methods. In terms of time efficiency, fluorescence imaging was significantly faster than frozen section pathology [6 (4, 7) min vs. 48 (46, 55) min, Z=-9.856, P < 0.001], thus showing a clear advantage regarding time efficiency for fluorescence imaging. Intraoperative fluorescence imaging via an EndoScell scanner, which represents a novel method for histopathological diagnosis, has high diagnostic accuracy and efficiency.

There was increased interest in using positron emission tomography (PET) for the evaluation of treatment response. We aimed to study the accuracy of metabolic complete response (mCR) on PET scan in predicting pathological complete response (pCR) after neoadjuvant treatment. Between January 1, 2014 and June 30, 2019, 356 consecutive patients who completed neoadjuvant treatment underwent PET scan before surgery. 207 patients (58.1%) achieved mCR and 128 patients (36.0%) achieved pathologic CR. Among mCR patients, 101 (48.8%) had pCR. Among pCR patients, 27 (21%) did not achieve mCR on PET. The overall sensitivity of predicting pCR with mCR was 78.9% and specificity of 53.5%. The overall accuracy was 0.691 by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Analysis using mCR to predict breast/axilla pCR had a sensitivity of 76.2%/67.9%, specificity of 54%/62.1%, and AUC of 0.682/0.675, respectively. Sensitivity and specificity were highest among HR-/HER2+ (87.1% and 57.1%), followed by HR+/HER2- (85% and 59.6%) and triple negative (82.1% and 54.1%) and the lowest were HR+/HER2+ (triple positive) (69.4% and 40.3%). There was little difference in sensitivity and specificity among the high and low Ki67 proliferation index (78.3% vs. 75% and 52.1% vs. 62.5%). PET was useful in evaluation of tumor response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy especially in the HR-HER2+ subtype. However, its accuracy was not high enough to replace surgery.","2025","World journal of surgery"

This was achieved by investigating the effects of supersaturation generation rates and doses on the extent of absorption (i.e., AUC) of Fenofibrate (FNB), a poorly-soluble model drug, from ASDs based on crosslinked poly(2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (PHEMA), physically crosslinked poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA), and polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP) in a rat model. Absorption modeling was conducted using GastroPlus® 9.7 to evaluate in vivo dissolution and absorption characteristics of FNB from these ASDs. The results show that the extent of FNB absorption from the rapid dissolution-controlled supersaturation build-up of PVP ASD was comparable to that of the gradual diffusion-controlled supersaturation generation from more hydrophilic PVA ASD; but both were higher than that of the less hydrophilic PHEMA ASD. The results also show that a moderate decrease in supersaturation rate is beneficial to the absorption of FNB. Moreover, this study confirms it is indeed possible to obtain similar exposure with lower doses of FNB when ASD formulations are employed as strategies for bioavailability enhancement.","2025","International journal of pharmaceutics"

Bone mineral density (BMD), measured by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), is the clinical standard for assessing overall bone quantity but falls short in accurately predicting vertebral fracture. Fracture risk prediction may be improved by incorporating metrics of microstructural organization from an appropriate imaging modality. Digital tomosynthesis (DTS)-derived textural and microstructural parameters have been previously correlated to vertebral bone strength in vitro, but the in vivo utility has not been explored. Therefore, the current study sought to establish the extent to which DTS-derived measurements of vertebral microstructure and size discriminate patients with and without vertebral fracture. In a cohort of 93 postmenopausal women with or without history of vertebral fracture, DTS-derived microstructural parameters and vertebral width were calculated for T12 and L1 vertebrae, as well as lumbar spine BMD and trabecular bone score (TBS) from DXA images. Fracture patients had lower BMD and TBS, while DTS-derived degree of anisotropy and vertebral width were higher, compared to nonfracture (p < 0.02 to p < 0.003) patients. The addition of DTS-derived parameters (fractal dimension, lacunarity, degree of anisotropy and vertebral width) improved discriminative capability for models of fracture status (AUC = 0.79) compared to BMD alone (AUC = 0.67). For twelve additional participants who were imaged twice, in vivo repeatability errors for DTS parameters were low (0.2 % - 7.3 %). The current results support the complementary use of DTS imaging for assessing bone quality and improving the accuracy of fracture risk assessment beyond that achievable by DXA alone.","2025","European journal of radiology"

Therefore, early determination of the risk of DCI is an urgent need. Machine learning (ML) has received much attention in clinical practice. Recently, some studies have attempted to apply ML models for early noninvasive prediction of DCI. However, systematic evidence for its predictive accuracy is still lacking. The aim of this study was to synthesize the prediction accuracy of ML models for DCI to provide evidence for the development or updating of intelligent detection tools. PubMed, Cochrane, Embase, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched up to May 18, 2023. The risk of bias in the included studies was assessed using PROBAST (Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool). During the analysis, we discussed the performance of different models in the training and validation sets. We finally included 48 studies containing 16,294 patients with SAH and 71 ML models with logistic regression as the main model type. In the training set, the pooled concordance index (C index), sensitivity, and specificity of all the models were 0.786 (95% CI 0.737-0.835), 0.77 (95% CI 0.69-0.84), and 0.83 (95% CI 0.75-0.89), respectively, while those of the logistic regression models were 0.770 (95% CI 0.724-0.817), 0.75 (95% CI 0.67-0.82), and 0.71 (95% CI 0.63-0.78), respectively. In the validation set, the pooled C index, sensitivity, and specificity of all the models were 0.767 (95% CI 0.741-0.793), 0.66 (95% CI 0.53-0.77), and 0.78 (95% CI 0.71-0.84), respectively, while those of the logistic regression models were 0.757 (95% CI 0.715-0.800), 0.59 (95% CI 0.57-0.80), and 0.80 (95% CI 0.71-0.87), respectively. ML models appear to have relatively desirable power for early noninvasive prediction of DCI after SAH. However, enhancing the prediction sensitivity of these models is challenging. Therefore, efficient, noninvasive, or minimally invasive low-cost predictors should be further explored in future studies to improve the prediction accuracy of ML models.

This study employs optimized MaxEnt models to analyze the potential distribution areas of A. chinensis and its host plants under current and future climate conditions, identifying their movement pathways and relative dynamics. Results indicate that all models achieved an average AUC value exceeding 0.86, demonstrating low complexity and high predictive accuracy. The key climatic variables influencing the geographic distribution of A. chinensis and its host plants include temperature and moisture-related bioclimatic variables such as mean diurnal range, minimum temp of coldest month, mean temp of wettest quarter, annual precipitation, precipitation of driest month, and precipitation seasonality. Under both current and future conditions, these 3 species are primarily distributed in the southwestern regions of China. Notably, the suitable growth area for all 3 species shows varying degrees of increase. Additionally, C. mollissima and C. seguinii exhibit a trend of eastward displacement in response to climate change. Overall, the findings provide significant practical value for the monitoring, early warning, and targeted control strategies for A. chinensis. Furthermore, these results offer a basis for timely conservation strategies to mitigate the potential impacts of climate change.","2025","Journal of economic entomology"

DLK1 overexpression has been reported in various cancer types, such as hepatocellular carcinoma and neuroblastoma. CBA-1205 demonstrates potent antitumor activity in multiple tumor models, making it a potential treatment option for DLK1-expressing cancers. This first-in-human, open-label Phase I study includes three parts. Part 1, the dose-escalation phase, primarily evaluates the safety profile, tolerability, and maximum tolerated dose of CBA-1205. The drug is administered intravenously every 2 weeks in a 28-day cycle. A standard 3 + 3 dose-escalation design was used across seven cohorts. In a cohort of 22 Japanese patients, over 80% had undergone three or more prior treatments. CBA-1205 was well tolerated, with no dose-limiting toxicity observed at doses ranging from 0.1 to 30 mg/kg, the planned highest dose. There were no treatment-related serious adverse events or trial-related deaths. CBA-1205 exposure, as measured by Cmax, AUC0-14, and AUC0-∞, increased in a dose-dependent manner. No serum anti-CBA-1205 antibodies were detected. Serum DLK1 concentrations were found in 6 out of 22 patients. Stable disease for over 6 months was observed in six patients, with progression-free survival ranging from 29 to 144 weeks. CBA-1205 was well tolerated, showing no severe toxicity in patients with advanced or recurrent solid tumors. The favorable safety profile and indications of potential activity support further investigation in Parts 2 and 3 of this Phase I study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of CBA-1205.","2025","Cancer science"

Machine learning models have shown great potential in predicting clinical outcomes; however, the optimal model for this specific problem remains unclear. Clinical data were collected and analyzed from 522 patients with ruptured HCC who underwent surgery at 7 different medical centers. Patients were assigned to the training, validation, and test groups in a random manner, with a distribution ratio of 7:1.5:1.5. Overall, 78 (14.9%) patients experienced postoperative PM. Five different types of models, including logistic regression, support vector machines, classification trees, random forests, and deep learning (DL) models, were trained using these data and evaluated based on their receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) values and F1 scores. The DL models achieved the highest AUC values (10-fold training cohort: 0.943, validation set: 0.928, and test set: 0.892) and F1 scores (10-fold training set: 0.917, validation cohort: 0.908, and test set:0.899) The results of the analysis indicate that tumor size, timing of hepatectomy, alpha-fetoprotein levels, and microvascular invasion are the most important predictive factors closely associated with the incidence of postoperative PM. The DL model outperformed all other machine learning models in predicting postoperative PM after the rupture of HCC based on clinical data.

This retrospective study included 864 patients (422 men, 442 women) with confirmed histopathological results across three medical centers, forming a training cohort, internal testing cohort, and external validation cohort. A novel hybrid model, Multi-Scale Large Kernel Attention with Mobile Vision Transformer (MVIT-MLKA), was developed, integrating CNN and Transformer architectures to classify pancreatic lesions. The model's performance was compared with traditional machine learning methods and advanced deep learning models. We also evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of radiologists with and without the assistance of the optimal model. Model performance was assessed through discrimination, calibration, and clinical applicability. The MVIT-MLKA model demonstrated superior performance in classifying pancreatic lesions, achieving an AUC of 0.974 (95% CI 0.967-0.980) in the training set, 0.935 (95% CI 0.915-0.954) in the internal testing set, and 0.924 (95% CI 0.902-0.945) in the external validation set, outperforming traditional models and other deep learning models (P < 0.05).

Suspected KC was defined as borderline cases with no definitive clinical or topographical abnormalities in both eyes. The eyes were divided into progressed (P) and non-progressed (NP) groups using the ABCD grading system of Scheimpflug-based tomography. The Scheimpflug-based corneal biomechanical parameters evaluated included deformation amplitude ratio within 2 mm, integrated radius, Ambrósio relational thickness to the horizontal profile, stiffness parameter at the first applanation, stress-strain index, E-staging, and Corvis Biomechanical Index. The optimized tomographic/biomechanical index (TBIv2), Belin/Ambrósio Enhanced Ectasia Deviation (BAD-D), and inferior-superior axial steepening values from Scheimpflug-based tomography were also evaluated. Twenty-three and 41 eyes were categorized into the P and NP groups, respectively. Logistic regression analysis showed that age, BAD-D, and TBIv2 could predict ectasia progression. The specificity, sensitivity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) values for BAD-D combined with age were 0.82, 0.60, and 0.83, respectively, whereas those for TBIv2 combined with age were 0.65, 0.82, and 0.82, respectively.

This study aims to assess the relationship between these parameters and coronary severity and to evaluate their predicting adverse outcomes. A total of 134 ACS patients and 50 healthy controls were included in this prospective observational study. Platelet morphological parameters (MPV, PDW, and P-LCR) were measured at admission, and coronary artery lesion severity was determined using the Gensini score from coronary angiography. Multivariate logistic regression analysis assessed the predictive value of these platelet parameters for adverse outcomes, and ROC curve analysis was used to evaluate their diagnostic performance. MPV, PDW, and P-LCR were significantly higher in ACS patients compared to healthy controls (p < 0.001). A strong positive correlation was found between platelet parameters and the Gensini score (MPV: r = 0.778, PDW: r = 0.800, P-LCR: r = 0.761; p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression identified MPV (OR = 1.807, p < 0.001), PDW (OR = 1.700, p = 0.001), and P-LCR (OR = 1.287, p < 0.001) as independent predictors of advent prognosis.

Studies using tumor-agnostic approaches report ctDNA in 10-15% of patients, though with uncertainty as to whether the signal originates from the adenoma. To obtain an accurate estimate of the proportion of patients with ctDNA, a sensitive tumor-informed strategy is preferred, as it ensures the detected signal originates from the adenoma. Here, tumor-informed whole-genome sequencing-based ctDNA analysis (MRD-EDGESNV) was applied to two independent cohorts. Cohort 1, comprising 93 patients with stage III colorectal cancer (CRC) and 40 healthy individuals, was used to establish the signal threshold at 95% specificity. This threshold was then applied to Cohort 2, consisting of 22 patients with symptomatic and 20 with asymptomatic adenomas. In stage III, MRD-EDGESNV had an area under the curve of 0.98. ctDNA was detected in 50% and 25% of patients with symptomatic and asymptomatic adenomas, respectively. The median adenoma plasma tumor fraction was 5.9 × 10-5.

Gene expression datasets GSE136825, GSE179265, and GSE196169 were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) for analysis. Candidate genes were identified by intersecting differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the CRSwNP and control groups (DEGsall) with those between the high- and low-score groups within the CRSwNP cohort (DEGsNP). Biomarker selection was performed using the Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM-RFE), and the Boruta algorithm. Further refinement of biomarkers was carried out using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, with genes demonstrating an area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.7 being considered significant. Genes exhibiting consistent expression trends and significant differences across both GSE136825 and GSE179265 were selected as potential biomarkers. Cell-type annotation was performed on GSE196169, and the expression profiles of the biomarkers across various cell types were analyzed. A competing endogenous RNA (ceRNA) network and a biomarker-drug interaction network were also established. Additionally, the mRNALocater database was utilized to determine the cellular localization of the identified biomarkers. The intersection of 1817 DEGsall and 24 DEGsNP yielded 15 candidate genes. Further filtering through LASSO, SVM-RFE, and Boruta led to the identification of seven candidate biomarkers: PRB3, KRT16, MUC6, SPAG4, FGFBP1, NR4A1, and GSTA2. Six of these genes demonstrated strong diagnostic performance in GSE179265, while four biomarkers, showing both significant differences and consistent expression trends, were validated in both GSE179265 and GSE136825. Single-cell sequencing analysis of GSE196169 revealed seven distinct cell types, including endothelial cells, with the biomarkers predominantly expressed in epithelial cells.

Key indicators included forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), peak expiratory flow (PEF), and single-breath diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide (DLCOc SB). A logistic regression model was employed to identify factors influencing positive BPT results, while the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to assess the diagnostic efficacy of these indicators. A total of 4211 valid samples were analyzed, with 3388 patients (80.46%) testing positive for BPT. Significant differences were observed between positive and negative groups regarding age, gender, smoking status (all P < 0.05), and specific lung function indicators, including FVC, FEV1/FVC ratio, maximum of vital capacity (VC max), and DLCOc SB (all P < 0.001).

The CDK1/CX3CR1 ratio had the best performance to predict all-cause ICU mortality, with an area under the ROC curve (AUROC) of 0.77 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.88-0.66) at day 1 and of 0.82 (95% CI 0.91-0.72) at days 2-3 after ICU admission. This performance was better than that of each individual mRNA biomarker. In the external validation cohort, the predictive performance of the CDK1/CX3CR1 ratio, measured using RT-qPCR, was similar to that of lactate when measure at day 1, and higher when measured at days 2-3. Combining lactate levels and the CDK1/CX3CR1 ratio, we identify 3 groups of patients with an increasing risk of ICU-mortality, ranging from 9 to 60% with an intermediate-risk group mortality rate of 28%. With stable predictive performance over the first 3 days following ICU admission, the CDK1/CX3CR1 ratio identifies three groups of septic patients with increasing ICU mortality risk. In combination with lactate, this novel biomarker strategy may be useful for sepsis patient stratification for personalized medicine trials and ICU management.","2024","Frontiers in medicine"

Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into two groups: a normal control group and a ceftriaxone-associated dysbiotic group. The composition of the intestinal flora was examined using 16S rRNA sequencing analysis. Voriconazole concentrations were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) of microbes from the different groups were prepared for in vitro study in Caco-2 cells. The Nrf2 pathway and its related proteins involved in modifying P-glycoprotein (P-gp) expression were clarified by a series of immunoblot analyses. The diversity and richness of intestinal bacteria, especially the abundance of gram-negative bacteria, were significantly decreased after ceftriaxone treatment. The AUC(0-t) and Cmax of voriconazole were reduced, and greater voriconazole clearance were noted in the dysbiotic group. An in vivo study also indicated that the expression of P-glycoprotein was significantly increased after ceftriaxone treatment, which may be due to the absence of gram-negative bacteria in the intestine. Finally, in vitro findings in Caco-2 cells treated with OMVs from the ceftriaxone-associated dysbiotic group suggested that Nrf2 translocation into the nucleus induced high expression of P-gp. OMVs from intestinal bacterial in the ceftriaxone-associated dysbiotic group induced high P-gp expression by regulating the Nrf2 signalling pathway, which led to an in vivo reduction in the bioavailability of voriconazole due to ceftriaxone-associated dysbiosis.","2024","Frontiers in pharmacology"

However, it is associated with an increased risk of coagulation disorders (CD) and causes severe bleeding in some instances. Early identification of risk factors and prediction of CD related to CPZ/SAM are crucial for prevention and treatment. This study aimed to explore the risk factors and developed a nomogram model for predicting the risk of coagulopathy in patients undergoing CPZ/SAM treatment. A total of 1719 patients who underwent CPZ/SAM in the Affiliated Hospital of Southwest Medical University from August 2018 to August 2022, were recruited as the training cohort. For validation, 1,059 patients treated with CPZ/SAM from September 2022 to August 2024 were enrolled. Patients were divided into the CD and the N-CD groups. The occurrence of CD was designated as the dependent variable. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the risk factors of CD. A nomogram model was constructed from the multivariate logistic regression analysis and internally validated for model discrimination and calibration. The performance of the nomogram was estimated using the concordance index (C-index) and calibration curve. The multivariate logistic regression analysis resulted in the following independent risk factors for CD: baseline INR level (OR: 5.768, 95% CI: 0.484∼11.372, p = 0.036), nutritional risk (OR:2.711, 95%CI: 1.495∼4.125, p < 0.001), comorbidity of digestive system (OR:1.287, 95%CI: 0.434∼2.215, p = 0.004), poor food intake (OR:1.261, 95%CI: 0.145∼2.473, p = 0.032), ALB level (OR: -0.132, 95%CI: -0.229∼-0.044, p = 0.005) and GFR< 30 mL/min (OR: 1.925, 95%CI: 0.704∼3.337, p = 0.004). The internal validation confirmed the model's good performance (C-index, 0.905 [95% CI: 0.864∼0.945]). The calibration plots in the nomogram model were of high quality. Validation further confirmed the reliability of the nomogram, with a C-index of 0.886 (95% CI: 0.832-0.940). The nomogram model facilitated accurate prediction of CD in patients undergoing CPZ/SAM. And this could potentially contribute to reducing the incidence of CPZ/SAM-associated CD and consequently improving patients' outcomes.","2024","Frontiers in pharmacology"

Our study aimed to explore whether phenylalanine is associated with the risk of SVD and to further explore whether phenylalanine interacted with the duration of T2DM to alter the risk of SVD. A total of 1,032 T2DM patients were enrolled using the Liaoning Medical University First Affiliated Hospital (LMUFAH) system. SVD was defined as patients with diabetic nephropathy (DN) or diabetic retinopathy (DR) alone, or both. Serum amino acids were measured by mass spectrometry (MS) technology. A binary logistic regression model was used to examine associations of phenylalanine with SVD risk. Restricted cubic spline (RCS) regression was used to draw the odds ratio curves of plasma phenylalanine for SVD. Additive interaction analysis was employed to test the interaction of low phenylalanine with a long duration of T2DM for SVD. Among the 1,032 T2DM patients, 286 (27.7%) had SVD. Phenylalanine <42μmol/L was associated with a markedly increased risk of SVD (OR 1.76, 95%CI 1.23 to 2.51), which was enhanced by a duration of T2DM of ≥5 years to 4.83 (95%CI 2.97-7.87) with significant additive interactions. The inclusion of phenylalanine and duration of T2DM into a traditional risk factor model substantially increased the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve from 0.67 to 0.71 (95% CI 0.70 to 0.75) (P <0.05). In Chinese patients with T2DM, phenylalanine <42μmol/L was associated with an increased risk of SVD, which was further amplified by a duration of T2DM of ≥5 years.","2024","Frontiers in endocrinology"

Data were collected from HFRS patients at the First Affiliated Hospital of Dali University and Dali Prefecture People's Hospital (2013-2023). Patients were divided into HFRS with AP (n = 34) and HFRS without AP groups (n = 356). Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and logistic regression analyzed the impact of AP on HFRS severity and short-term prognosis. LASSO-Logistic regression was used to screen risk factors and develop a nomogram model. After PSM, HFRS patients with AP had higher rates of Continuous Renal Replacement Therapy (CRRT) and/or mechanical ventilation use, , ICU admission, and 30-day mortalitycompared with those without AP (p < 0.05). Further analysis revealed that smoking (OR: 3.702), ferritin (OR: 1.002), white blood cell (OR), fibrinogen (OR: 0.463), and platelet (OR: 0.987) were risk factors for HFRS with AP (p < 0.05). A nomogram model was constructed based on these factors, to predict the risk of HFRS with AP, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% CI: 0.84-0.95). Additionally, the model calibration curve fit well according to the Hosmer-Lemeshow test (χ2=8.51, p = 0.39). Patients with HFRS with AP exhibit higher disease severity and poorer prognosis. Smoking, elevated ferritin and white blood cell levels, decreased fibrinogen and platelet levels are more susceptible to developing AP.","2025","Annals of medicine"

Recent advancements in machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) have led to the development of promising tools for the early detection and diagnosis of OPLL. This systematic review evaluated the diagnostic performance of ML and DL models and clinical implications in OPLL detection. A systematic review was conducted following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. PubMed/Medline and Scopus databases were searched for studies published between January 2000 and September 2024. Eligible studies included those utilizing ML or DL models for OPLL detection using imaging data. All studies were assessed for the risk of bias using appropriate tools. The key performance metrics, including accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC), were analyzed. Eleven studies, comprising a total of 6,031 patients, were included. The ML and DL models demonstrated high diagnostic performance, with accuracy rates ranging from 69.6% to 98.9% and AUC values up to 0.99. Convolutional neural networks and random forest models were the most used approaches. The overall risk of bias was moderate, and concerns were primarily related to participant selection and missing data. In conclusion, ML and DL models show great potential for accurate detection of OPLL, particularly when integrated with imaging techniques. However, to ensure clinical applicability, further research is warranted to validate these findings in more extensive and diverse populations.","2025","Asian spine journal"

In all, 62 patients with confirmed HPV-HSIL (14 CIN II, 48 CIN III) and 65 age- and parity-matched women with neither HPV infection nor CIN were compared. Seven parameters by TV-PDU were used to assess vascular classification and micro-vessel flow velocity, including vascular grading (class I, II, III), lowest pulsatility index (PI), resistance index (RI), peak systolic velocity (PS), end-diastolic velocity (ED), time average maximum velocity (TAMV), and the vascular index (VI = PS/ED). HSIL was primarily associated with vascular class I (75.8%), followed by class II (14.5%) and class III (9.7%). PI, RI, and VI in HSIL were significantly lower than the control group (P < 0.0001). Mean PI, RI, and VI values decreased progressively from the normal cervix to CIN II-III. At a PI cutoff of 1.03, sensitivity was 88.7%, specificity was 83.8%, and area under the curve (AUC) was 95.0. At an RI cutoff of 0.68, sensitivity was 96.8%, specificity 61.5%, and AUC 84.0. At a VI cutoff of 2.84, sensitivity was 85.5%, specificity 78.5%, and AUC 85.0. Based on different patterns of hotspot vascular classification and micro-vessel flow velocity waveforms, particularly PI between HSIL and the normal cervix, TV-PDU may offer a potential role for aiding the planning for patients with suspicious HSIL.

Therefore, we aimed to investigate the metabolic responses to glucagon stimulation in type 1 diabetes and explore whether recent exposure to hypoglycemia would impact glucagon sensitivity. Twenty-nine participants, 19 with type 1 diabetes and ten healthy controls, underwent a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp with five-stepwise ascending glucagon injections. Metabolic responses were assessed before and during each glucagon injection. During the glucagon injections, the series of the incremental area under the curve of plasma glucose concentration did not differ between the groups. However, during the first injection of 10 μg glucagon, participants with type 1 diabetes produced a higher incremental area under the plasma glucose concentration curve than healthy controls. Plasma concentration of non-esterified fatty acids, glycerol, and metabolites from metabolomic analyses did not differ between the groups. In participants with type 1 diabetes, exposure to hypoglycemia did not impact the metabolic responses induced by glucagon. Generally, metabolic responses to glucagon stimulation in type 1 diabetes are similar to healthy controls. However, elevated glucose production was observed following the lowest glucagon dose in participants with type 1 diabetes compared to healthy controls, indicating enhanced glucagon sensitivity to low-dose glucagon stimulations.

Accurately predicting circRNA-disease associations is crucial for understanding their biological functions and disease mechanisms. This work introduces the MNDCDA method, designed to address the challenges posed by the limited number of known circRNA-disease associations and the high cost of biological experiments. MNDCDA integrates multiple biological data sources with neighborhood-aware embedding models and deep feature projection networks to predict potential pathways linking circRNAs to diseases. Initially, comprehensive biometric data are used to construct four similarity networks, forming a diverse circRNA-disease interaction framework. Next, a neighborhood-aware embedding model captures structural information about circRNAs and diseases, while deep feature projection networks learn high-order feature interactions and nonlinear connections. Finally, a bilinear decoder identifies novel associations between circRNAs and diseases. The MNDCDA model achieved an AUC of 0.9070 on a constructed benchmark dataset. In case studies, 25 out of 30 predicted circRNA-disease pairs were validated through wet lab experiments and published literature. These extensive experimental results demonstrate that MNDCDA is a robust computational tool for predicting circRNA-disease associations, providing valuable insights while helping to reduce research costs.","2025","Journal of chemical information and modeling"

The study included 737 patients (46-88 years old). Routine laboratory measurements were used to train machine learning models using H2O AutoML. We created a model that classifies prostate biopsy results as malignant or benign. The performance of the best model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), log-loss metric, F1 score, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and specificity. The model's performance was evaluated through the SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis feature-based interpretation method applied to comprehend the machine learning model. The gradient boosting machine model was the most successful. The best result was obtained in the model with 11 parameters, including PSA, free PSA, free PSA to PSA, hemoglobin, neutrophils, platelets, neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), glucose, platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), lymphocytes, and age. The AUC of this model was 0.72, the specificity was 0.84, the PPV was 0.65, the NPV was 0.69, and the accuracy was 0.68.

Despite advancements in surgical techniques, a portion of patients only show limited clinical improvement post-evacuation. Surgical intervention decisions are critically important, as they can either improve or worsen a patient's condition. Radiomics offers significant potential by extracting complex patterns from digital medical images and transforming them into high-dimensional data that reflect the underlying pathophysiology. By integrating Radiomics with individual patient characteristics, we can develop decision support models. This study aims to analyze radiomic parameters of aSDH to determine whether they support the decision to proceed with urgent surgery or opt for a conservative approach. We hypothesized that surface area could be a significant predictor of neurological outcome such as maintaining independent mobility (mRS ≥ 3) and survival rates. This retrospective study involved radiomic analysis according to neurological outcome and survival. Radiomic parameters were measured using 3D Slicer software. Statistical analyses explored correlations, employing AUC-analysis and Kaplan-Meier survival. Our findings revealed significant correlations between hematoma and surface area with poorer neurological prognosis. Further subgroup analysis showed surface area as a significant predictor for poorer outcomes in patients undergoing craniotomy (p = 0.006 in univariant- and p = 0.020 in multivariant analysis). In the total cohort, among conservatively managed and craniotomy subgroups, survival analysis highlighted an advantageous survival for patients exhibiting smaller surface areas (< 339.50 cm2). Especially in craniotomy patients, surface area emerged as a possible predictor for neurological outcome and survival.","2025","Acta neurochirurgica"

Previous literature, on the basis of small sample sizes, concludes that there are several risk factors for the development of PPCS. We seek to identify protective and risk factors for developing slow recovery or persisting post-concussion symptoms (PPCS) by analyzing medical history, contact sport level, setting, and the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT) and Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI-18) assessments at baseline and post-injury. We studied 47,860 unique collegiate athletes and Military Service Academy (MSA) cadets enrolled in the 30-site National Collegiate Athletic Association and Department of Defense (NCAA-DoD) Concussion Assessment Research and Education (CARE) Consortium prospective cohort study of baseline and post-injury data from 2014 to 2019. Medical histories and preseason baselines (n = 60,720), along with SCAT and BSI-18 examinations (n = 5379) conducted within 48 h post-injury, were analyzed. PPCS is defined as cleared for return to play (RTP) > 29 days. Of 5073 concussions, the median (95% CI) and mean (SD) RTP were 15.2 (4.8-82.6) days and 22.2 (23.0) days, respectively, with 891 developing PPCS. Sex, high SCAT score, high BSI-18 score, and delayed reporting produced small effect sizes on RTP (d = 0.22-0.44). Adjusted odds ratios (OR) of developing PPCS indicated the following risk factors: SCAT total score > 45 (OR = 1.91, 95% CI: 1.58-2.30), female sex (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.53-2.13), concussion history (OR = 1.80, 95% CI: 1.29-2.52), and delayed reporting (OR = 1.42, 95% CI: 1.20-1.67). In contrast, protective factors against developing PPCS were: being a limited-contact (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.25-0.47), noncontact (OR = 0.35, 95% CI: 0.24-0.51) or contact sport athlete (OR = 0.34, 95% CI: 0.28-0.41); and receiving the concussion at practice (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.53-0.77) or in competition (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.34-0.56). Athletes diagnosed with a learning disability and taking a neurostimulant were more protected than those who were not (OR = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.26-0.76 versus OR = 0.72, 95% CI: 0.49-1.05, respectively). A prognostic model using these variables offers poor sensitivity (9%) but high specificity (98%) in identifying PPCS (AUC = 0.72). This study of 5073 concussions indicates that female sex, high symptom burden, and prior concussion are risk factors for slow recovery. In addition, learning disability, contact sport, and concussion in competition are protective against slow recovery. The neurostimulant results suggest that clinicians should keep their attention deficit disorder (ADD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) patients on their current neurostimulant medication after a concussion.

To develop a deep learning framework to synthesize [11C]CFT PET images from real [18F]FDG PET images and leverage their cross-modal correlation to distinguish PD from normal control (NC). We developed a deep learning framework to synthesize [11C]CFT PET images from real [18F]FDG PET images, and leveraged their cross-modal correlation to distinguish PD from NC. A total of 604 participants (274 with PD and 330 with NC) who underwent [11C]CFT and [18F]FDG PET scans were included. The quality of the synthetic [11C]CFT PET images was evaluated through quantitative comparison with the ground-truth images and radiologist visual assessment. The evaluations of PD diagnosis performance were conducted using biomarker-based quantitative analyses (using striatal binding ratios from synthetic [11C]CFT PET images) and the proposed PD classifier (incorporating both real [18F]FDG and synthetic [11C]CFT PET images). Visualization result shows that the synthetic [11C]CFT PET images resemble the real ones with no significant differences visible in the error maps. Quantitative evaluation demonstrated that synthetic [11C]CFT PET images exhibited a high peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR: 25.0-28.0) and structural similarity (SSIM: 0.87-0.96) across different unilateral striatal subregions.

The subjects of this study were 209 patients who underwent hepatectomy for CRLM between February, 2005 and September, 2023. The HALP score was defined as (albumin [mg/dL] × hemoglobin [g/L] × lymphocyte [count/L]) / platelet [count/L]. The cutoff value was calculated according to the receiver operating characteristic curve based on 3-year survival. The cutoff value of the HALP score was 35, and a low HALP score was confirmed in 107 patients (51%). Multivariate analysis of disease-free survival identified lymph node metastasis (HR 1.53, p = 0.03), extrahepatic lesions (HR 2.48, p < 0.01), and a low HALP score (HR 2.0, p < 0.01) as independently poor prognostic factors.

SCARLET was a single-arm phase II study of chemotherapy-naïve patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-Sq NSCLC. Participants received sotorasib 960 mg daily plus four cycles of carboplatin (area under the curve, 5)/pemetrexed 500 mg/m2, followed by sotorasib/pemetrexed until disease progression. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate (ORR); secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), and safety. Using plasma samples, next-generation sequencing was performed at baseline, 3 weeks, and disease progression (jRCT2051210086). Thirty patients were enrolled between Oct 2021 and Jul 2022, with a median follow-up of 14.8 months. ORR was 88.9% (80% confidence interval [CI], 78.5-94.8%; 95% CI, 70.8-97.6%), median PFS was 6.6 months (95% CI, 5.3-16.7 months), and median OS was 20.6 months (95% CI, 8.1 months-not estimated). Among patients with programmed death ligand 1 expression levels ≥ 1% and < 1%, ORRs were 82.3 and 100% and median PFS was 7.6 and 9.7 months, respectively. Using plasma samples, patients without KRAS G12C at baseline, without KRAS-related pathway co-alterations, or who cleared KRAS G12C at 3 weeks had better median PFS (16.7, 13.9, 8.7 months, respectively). TP53 mutation and epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and MET amplification were detected acquired resistances. In patients with KRAS G12C-mutated non-Sq NSCLC, sotorasib plus carboplatin/pemetrexed demonstrated favorable efficacy especially in PD-L1 <1%, with manageable toxicity.","2025","Journal of thoracic oncology : official publication of the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer"

In Somaliland, urbanization and lifestyle transitions have increased the prevalence of CVDs, necessitating an in-depth exploration of associated risk factors. This study investigated the relationship between lifestyle factors and CVD prevalence among adult patients in Somaliland using data from the Hargeisa Group Hospital in 2024. A cross-sectional design was employed, enrolling 411 adults aged ≥ 18 years. Data were collected through structured questionnaires and analyzed using traditional statistical methods and seven supervised machine learning models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), Probit Regression, KNN and Decision Tree. The study assessed associations between sociodemographic variables, lifestyle factors, and CVD prevalence while evaluating the predictive model performance. Age and smoking were the most significant predictors of CVD prevalence across all models, with individuals aged ≥ 60 years exhibiting the highest risk. Urban residence was associated with lower CVD prevalence, while behaviors such as khat chewing and physical inactivity increased the risk. Machine learning models, notably SVM, demonstrated robust predictive performance, achieving an accuracy of 63.4 % and an AUC of 67.1 %. Lifestyle factors, particularly smoking, khat chewing, and dietary habits, are critical drivers of the CVD prevalence in Somaliland. These findings underscore the need for targeted public health interventions focusing on smoking cessation, dietary improvements, and culturally sensitive awareness campaigns. Machine learning techniques offer valuable tools for enhancing the predictive accuracy and guiding tailored health strategies.","2025","Current problems in cardiology"

However, previous studies only explored the feasibility of radiomics in clinical applications. Therefore, the objective of this study was to obtain the most relevant radiomics features with the aging changes of myelin proteins and compare their diagnostic performances with the diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) parameters to identify the reliability of these features as imaging biomarkers for assessing brain aging. Thirty middle-aged and thirty old-aged mice were assigned to the training set to explore the most relevant features of myelin proteins and their diagnostic performances. Ten middle-aged and ten old-aged mice were assigned to the testing set to further validate the reproducibility of the features. T2-weighted imaging and DTI were conducted to obtain white matter radiomics features and DTI parameters. Myelin proteins, including proteolipid protein (PLP) and myelin basic protein (MBP), were examined by immunofluorescence staining in the regions of the whole brain, cortex, corpus callosum, striatum, and anterior commissure. The Pearson correlation analysis was used to observe the correlations between radiomics features and myelin proteins. The four most relevant features with the top four correlation coefficients were selected to compare their diagnostic performances with the DTI parameters, including fractional anisotropy (FA), mean diffusivity (MD), axial diffusivity (AxD), and radial diffusivity (RD). Wavelet-HLL_glszm_ZoneEntropy, wavelet-HLL_gldm_DependenceEntropy, wavelet-LHL_glszm_ZoneEntropy, and log-sigma-2-0-mm-3D_gldm_DependenceEntropy were the four most relevant features, which had moderately significant correlations with PLP. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of the four features were 0.940, 0.917, 0.831, and 0.964 in the training set, and 0.880, 0.840, 0.860, and 0.880 in the testing set. The AUCs of FA, MD, AxD, and RD were 0.864, 0.743, 0.673, and 0.778 in the training set, and 0.780, 0.710, 0.670, and 0.730 in the testing set. These results demonstrated that radiomics features of white matter displayed significant correlations with myelin proteins and their performances were comparable or even superior to DTI parameters, which ensured their reliability as non-invasive imaging biomarkers for evaluating brain aging.","2025","NeuroImage"

Medical records of 301 consecutive patients who underwent hepatectomy were retrospectively reviewed. We divided the patients into infection-positive and infection-negative groups. We investigated the changes in perioperative inflammatory markers such as C-reactive protein level (CRP) and PCT level. Associations between infectious complications and perioperative inflammatory markers were evaluated to identify predictive factors of infectious complications after hepatectomy. Postoperative infectious complications occurred in 67 (22.3%) patients. The areas under the curve (AUCs) using PCT levels on postoperative days (PODs) 1 and 3 were 0.794 and 0.845, respectively, whereas those using CRP were 0.493 and 0.641, respectively. PCT level had a better AUC than CRP for predicting postoperative infectious complications on PODs 1 and 3. Multivariate analysis indicated PCT levels on PODs 1 and 3 were an independent predictor of infectious complications after hepatectomy. PCT is the only predictive marker for infectious complications after hepatectomy and is valuable for detecting infectious complications from POD 1.","2025","Digestive surgery"

International guidelines recommend limiting catheter dwell time to reduce the risk of adverse events, and this drives clinical decision-making regarding catheter removal, yet other risk factors may also influence the risk of adverse events. The aim of this study was to develop a clinically useful risk prediction model that could be utilised in the neonatal intensive care unit to identify infants at a greater risk of developing an adverse event associated with umbilical vascular catheters. A risk prediction model was developed for the umbilical venous catheter and umbilical arterial catheter based on the dataset of a published retrospective cohort study in a South Australian neonatal intensive care unit. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression was used to develop the model. Deviance was used to evaluate the model's goodness of fit, and the Hosmer-Lemeshow test and calibration plot were used to assess calibration. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve evaluated the model's discrimination. For adverse events associated with umbilical venous catheters, the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator model selected none of the potential predictor variables. Five predictors of adverse events were identified for umbilical arterial catheters: thrombocytopaenia, intrauterine growth restriction/small for gestational age, congenital heart disease/defects including patent ductus arteriosus, maternal diabetes, and a dwell time of >7 days. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.68 (95% confidence interval: 0.61-0.74). A link test found that the model was properly specified, and a Hosmer-Lemeshow test demonstrated that the model was well calibrated (p = 0.104). A risk prediction model has been developed to identify infants at a greater risk of an adverse event associated with umbilical arterial catheters.

We aimed to evaluate the diagnostic value and clinical utility of the simplified Edinburgh computed tomography (CT) criteria for CAA-related hemorrhage in Chinese patients. We analyzed 212 patients with lobar hemorrhage who underwent brain CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) from a multicentre cohort. Using the Boston criteria version 2.0 (v2.0) as the gold standard, we assessed the application value of the simplified Edinburgh CT criteria, and investigated whether the Edinburgh CT criteria predict patient outcomes. Patients with probable CAA accounted for 36.6% according to the Boston criteria v2.0. The Edinburgh CT criteria indicated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) of 0.735 for the diagnosis of probable CAA, and it performed better when there was a high-risk threshold of CAA in the decision curve analysis. Patients with a high risk of CAA based on the Edinburgh CT criteria had poorer outcomes at 90-day after adjusting for confounding factors (p = 0.034). Finger-like projections in the Edinburgh CT criteria were associated with lobar microbleeds, cortical superficial siderosis, and multispot white matter hyperintensity according to the Boston criteria. Taking the Boston criteria v2.0 as the gold standard, the Edinburgh CT criteria demonstrated good diagnostic value and predicted outcomes well at 90-day in Chinese patients with lobar hemorrhage.

A prediction model was constructed using machine learning algorithm. WGCNA was employed to analyze differential regulation modules among different clusters of stroke patients. The analysis results were validated using single-cell sequencing data. Finally, autophagy hub genes were validated in an external cohort and an IS mouse model. We observed suppressed autophagy states in IS patients. A diagnostic model with good clinical efficacy for stroke diagnosis was constructed based on the selected key genes (AUC = 0.87). Consensus clustering identified two IS subtypes with distinct gene expression patterns and immune cell infiltration. scRNA-seq data analysis confirmed downregulation of pexophagy in IS. CellChat analysis identified key signaling pathways and intercellular interactions related to pexophagy. Validation in an external cohort and IS mouse model confirmed differential gene expression, supporting the involvement of pexophagy in IS pathogenesis.

This study investigated the potential of machine learning to improve neurocognitive outcome prediction at two and five years of corrected age in preterm infants, using readily available predictors from the neonatal setting. Predictors originating from the antenatal and neonatal period of preterm infants born <30 weeks gestation were used to predict adverse neurocognitive outcome on the Bayley Scale and Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence. Machine learning models were compared to conventional logistic regression and validated using internal cross-validation. Best performing models were a random forest (two-year outcome) and a support vector machine (five-year outcome) with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.682 and 0.695 respectively, reaching high negative predictive values (95% and 91%, respectively). These models performed significantly better than the conventional models. The models reached moderate overall predictive performance, yet with promising potential for early identification of children without adverse neurocognitive outcome. Machine learning modestly improved neurocognitive outcome prediction. Future research may harvest the predictive potential of a wider variety of routine (clinical) data, such as vital sign time series. Early prediction of neurocognitive outcome in preterm infants will enable targeted follow-up and deployment of early (preventative) interventions to improve outcome. Neurocognitive outcome remains notoriously challenging using conventional models, while existing machine learning models depend on advanced MRI-derived predictors with limited potential for implementation into daily clinical practice. This study developed machine learning models for neurocognitive outcome prediction using predictors that are readily available in neonatal settings. Neurocognitive outcome prediction remains challenging due to low AUC and PPV, however, the models demonstrate high NPV, indicating potential for identifying children at low risk for adverse outcome.","2025","Pediatric research"

LP is difficult to differentiate from other similar diseases without pathological evidence, such as upper respiratory tract infection (URTI), pneumonia, cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP), lung mucinous adenocarcinoma and pulmonary edema. Given the high misdiagnosis rate and limited statistical clinical and treatment data, there is an urgent need for novel indicators of LP. Superoxide dismutase type1 (SOD1) plays an essential role in macrophage polarization, promoting inflammation and oxidative stress, but its association with LP remains unknown. The clinical data of 22 patients with proven LP from January 2008 to June 2024 and their prognostic information up to June 2024 were retrospectively gathered (ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT06430008). Additionally, information on patients with URTI, bacterial and fungal pneumonia, COP, PAP, lung mucinous adenocarcinoma and pulmonary edema, was collected totaling 140 patients as control subjects. Receiver operating characteristic curve, machine learning (ML), regression and survival analyses were performed to analyze the data. In multivariate regression analysis, the sole independent risk factor of LP was the level of SOD1 (OR 0.922, 95% CI: 0.878 ~ 0.967, P < 0.001), while smoking status (β= -0.177, 95% CI -18.645~-2.836, P = 0.008), diabetes mellitus (β= -0.191, 95% CI: -20.442~-3.592, P = 0.005), and total sialic acid (TSA) (β= -0.426, 95% CI: -0.915~ -0.433, P < 0.001) independently influenced the level of SOD1.

From the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 2005-2018 cycles, a total of 39,631 participants aged 20 and older were included. Fried status, FRAIL status, and FI status were determined for each individual based on the cutoff values from the continuous scores of their respective scales. Univariate and multivariate models, incorporating 11 covariates-sex, age, body mass index, ethnicity, education, marital status, smoking status, alcohol intake, employment status, poverty-to-income ratio, and total energy intake-were fitted using Cox proportional hazards and 2 machine learning models. Model performance was assessed through Integrated Brier Score (IBS), concordance index (C-index), and area under the curve (AUC) values from 10-fold cross-validation. Key variable analysis was performed using permutation importance and C-index increment. Subgroup analysis was developed according to age. In univariate analyses, FI consistently outperformed Fried and FRAIL, showing significantly lower IBS, and higher C-index and AUC values. In multivariate analyses, few significant differences were found. Permutation importance analysis identified age as the most important variable, followed by Fried status and FI status. Similarly, in C-index increment analysis, age was the top one variable. Subgroup analyses showed that FI status consistently performed best in all metrics across univariate analyses at least in 40-59 and 60-79 age groups. FI status consistently emerged as the most important variable in permutation analysis across all age groups. FI demonstrated the best performance as a single predictor in predicting all-cause mortality, with age being crucial for enhancing predictive performance.

However, this method is cumbersome and time consuming to measure and calculate, and a standardized formula across different institutions is not available. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate the value of nonenhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for grading primary lower extremity lymphedema (PLEL). This retrospective study included 124 consecutive patients with unilateral PLEL from 2021 to 2023. All patients were categorized into three groups, mild (n = 43), moderate (n = 41), and severe (n = 40), according to the 2020 International Society of Lymphology grading standard. From the lymphedema involvement range (vertical range: whole lower extremity, only thigh, only calf and ankle; transversal range: ≤25% of the cross-section, 26%-50%, 51%-75%, and >75%), MRI signs of lymphedema (parallel lines sign, grid sign, honeycomb sign, band sign, crescent sign, lymphatic lake sign, and nebula sign), and lymphedema measurements (total diameter, total circumference, and total area of the affected limb; diameter and area of the bone, muscle, subcutaneous fat, and subcutaneous soft tissues on the affected limb; circumference of the bone and muscle on the affected limb; thickness of skin; thickness of band sign; thickness of crescent sign) were recorded and statistically analysed in the three groups of patients. The statistically significant differences in the indicators among the three groups were as follows: vertical and transversal ranges of lymphedema, parallel lines sign, grid sign, honeycomb sign, band sign, crescent sign, and lymphatic lake sign, total diameter, total circumference, total area, diameter and area of the subcutaneous fat, diameter and area of the subcutaneous soft tissues, thickness of skin, thickness of band sign and crescent sign (P < .05). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the highest area under the curve for each parameter for identifying patients in the mild and nonmild (including moderate and severe) groups was in the following order: diameter of the subcutaneous fat > area of the subcutaneous fat > thickness of the skin (P < .05). The receiver operating characteristic curve showed that the highest under the curve for each parameter used to identify patients in the severe and nonsevere (including mild and moderate) groups was in the following order: diameter of the subcutaneous fat > area of the subcutaneous fat > thickness of the crescent sign. The parallel lines sign is a characteristic indicator for diagnosing patients with a mild disease, the grid sign is a characteristic indicator for diagnosing patients with a moderate disease, the lymphatic lake sign and crescent sign are characteristic indicators for diagnosing patients with a severe disease, and the honeycomb sign and band sign are characteristic indicators for diagnosing patients with moderate to severe disease. The thickness of the skin, band sign and crescent sign gradually increased with increasing disease severity. The efficacy of the diameter and area of subcutaneous fat for PLEL grading is optimal. Nonenhanced MRI can be a better and standardized tool for grading PLEL.","2025","Journal of vascular surgery. Venous and lymphatic disorders"

Despite the fact that an increasing number of recently approved drugs no longer adhere to this rule, it continues to serve as a valuable guiding principle in the field of drug discovery. The present study aims to establish a set of rules specifically for the serum-accessible components of natural medicines. A comprehensive literature review was conducted to collect data on serum-accessible components of natural medicines, and machine learning methods were then applied to analyse and screen molecular features distinguishing serum-accessible components from non-serum-accessible ones. The most critical rules for serum-accessible components of natural medicines were identified, and these were named the ""Natural Medicine's Rule of 5 (NMRO5)."" We then compared the molecular property distributions and predictive performance of NMRO5 with RO5. Then, we developed a predictive model capable of directly assessing the possibility of a molecule being serum-accessible. This model was validated using in vivo experiments on multiple natural medicines. Furthermore, we performed molecular modifications on serum-accessible components to ""violate"" NMRO5, conducting both forward and reverse validations to confirm the reliability of NMRO5. The results obtained revealed that NMRO5 is characterised by the following: higher TPSA, MaxEState, and PEOE VSA1 values, and lower LogP and MinEState values. This indicates that natural medicine components with these properties are more likely to be serum-accessible or remain in plasma rather than being rapidly eliminated. The investigation revealed significant disparities among the five molecular properties of NMRO5, and the predictive performance of eight models based on NMRO5 consistently outperformed those based on RO5. This finding suggests that NMRO5 provides a more reliable framework for determining whether a molecule is serum-accessible compared to RO5. Finally, we developed a direct predictive model for serum-accessible components, achieving an accuracy of 0.7257, an F1 score of 0.7223, and an AUC of 0.7553.","2025","International journal of pharmaceutics"

We retrospectively included a total of 25 patients (mean age, 60 ± 12 years; 13 [52%] male) who underwent high-density mapping during both sinus/paced rhythm and AT. Omnipolar voltage and isochronal late activation maps of the left atrium were created on the basis of PF annotation. The CI of the AT was defined on the basis of both activation mapping and successful termination site/change in AT during ablation. A total of 30 ATs were mapped in the left atrium (22 [73.3%], localized reentry; 8 [26.7%], macroreentry). Median PF of the termination site was significantly higher compared with low-voltage zones alone (345 [209-530] Hz vs 235 (47-417] Hz; P < .001). PF had a significant predictive value for the termination site (area under the curve, 0.83; 95% confidence interval, 0.719-0.950; P < .001). When the cutoff value for PF was taken as 280 Hz, the sensitivity of the test was determined to be 80.0% and the specificity was determined to be 78.3%.

645,"39826138","Colorimetric analysis of intraoral scans: A novel approach for detecting gingival inflammation.","Gingivitis, a widely prevalent oral health condition, affects up to 80% of the population. Traditional assessment methods for gingivitis rely heavily on subjective clinical evaluation. This study seeks to explore the efficacy of interpreting the color metrics from intraoral scans to objectively differentiate between healthy and inflamed gingiva. This study used the percentage of bleeding on probing (BOP%) as the clinical reference standard. Intraoral scans, obtained before and after gingivitis treatment using a scanner, were analyzed through a custom MATLAB script to quantify HSV (hue, saturation, value) and CIELAB (Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage L*a*b*) color coordinates. The region of interest was a 2-mm-wide gingival strip along the buccal margin of the maxillary anterior teeth. Linear regression analysis was performed to evaluate the relationship between photometric outcomes and continuous, dichotomous, and categorical BOP data. Diagnostic accuracy was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC), as well as sensitivity and specificity measures. The analysis included clinical and digital color data from 110 scans, adhering to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology) guidelines. The multilevel linear regression analysis underscored a significant correlation between the BOP% and digital color metrics, specifically the CIELAB a* (red-green chroma), CIELAB b* (yellow-blue chroma), and color saturation, with AUC performances of 70%, 79.5%, and 80.8%, respectively. Digital color analysis of intraoral scans has demonstrated a range of performance from acceptable to excellent in distinguishing sites with BOP. This innovative approach presents a promising tool for dentists and researchers in the accurate diagnosis, screening, and management of gingivitis. Our study focuses on finding a better way to detect gingivitis, a common gum disease affecting many people. Traditional methods rely on the dentist's visual inspection, which can be subjective. We explored the use of color measurements from digital intraoral scans to objectively identify healthy versus inflamed gums. We analyzed 110 scans from 55 participants, examining the color differences in the gums before and after treatment. By measuring specific color values, we achieved up to 80.8% accuracy in distinguishing between healthy and inflamed gums. This method could offer a more reliable tool for dentists and researchers to diagnose and manage gingivitis, leading to better oral health outcomes.","2025","Journal of periodontology"

Transient receptor potential vanilloid 4 (TRPV4), a calcium-permeable non-selective cation channel, has been implicated in various cancers, including COAD. This study investigates the role of TRPV4 in colon adenocarcinoma and elucidates its potential mechanism via the ferroptosis pathway. Gene expression profiles and clinical data were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), encompassing 647 colon adenocarcinoma tissue samples and 51 normal colorectal tissue samples. Ferroptosis-related genes were retrieved from the FerrDb database. Differential expression analysis, survival analysis, and Cox proportional hazards regression were performed to assess the prognostic significance of TRPV4. Protein-protein interaction networks and gene enrichment analyses (GO and KEGG) were conducted to explore functional associations. In vitro experiments were carried out using HT-29 and SW480 colon cancer cell lines. TRPV4 was knocked down using siRNA, and cell viability was assessed via hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining. Immunofluorescence assays evaluated the expression of ferroptosis-related proteins (SLC3A2, GPX4) and proliferation markers (KI67, SRC, CTNNB1, COL1). TRPV4 expression was significantly elevated in colon adenocarcinoma tissues compared to normal tissues (p < 0.05), demonstrating high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.848). High TRPV4 expression correlated with poorer overall survival (OS) and disease-specific survival (DSS), particularly in patients over 65 years old and those in clinical stage II. Cox regression analysis confirmed TRPV4 as an independent prognostic factor (HR = 1.395, p = 0.074). Bioinformatics analyses revealed that TRPV4 is closely associated with ferroptosis-related genes, participating in key biological processes such as responses to external stimuli, oxidative stress, and cell adhesion. In vitro, TRPV4 knockdown significantly reduced cell viability (p < 0.05) and decreased expression levels of SLC3A2, GPX4, KI67, SRC, and COL1 (p < 0.05). The addition of the ferroptosis inhibitor FER-1 did not restore cell viability in TRPV4 knockdown cells, suggesting that TRPV4 modulates cell survival through the ferroptosis pathway. The bioinformation and in vitro experiments inTRPV4 and ferroptosis-related genes support the hypothesis that TRPV4 influences tumor cell survival via the ferroptosis pathway. The inability of FER-1 to rescue viability in TRPV4-deficient cells further confirms this mechanism. These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms of COAD and highlight TRPV4 as a potential therapeutic target. TRPV4 is significantly upregulated in COAD and is associated with unfavorable patient outcomes. It appears to promote tumor progression by regulating the ferroptosis pathway, affecting the expression of key ferroptosis-related genes and proliferation markers. Targeting TRPV4 may offer a new therapeutic approach for COAD, and further research is warranted to explore its role in other cancers and to develop TRPV4-based therapies.","2025","Digestive diseases and sciences"

The study consists of the developmental phase and reported the content validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, construct, criterion, and discriminant validity. The study included two groups; 'Group I (N = 90)' who had a neurological disorder and their parents, and 'Group II (N = 60)' who were typically developing children without any feeding and swallowing problems and their parents. Limited literature review, clinical experience, and parental interviews have been used in creating the item pool. A panel of 7 experts assessed the content validity in two Delphi rounds. Cronbach's α measured the internal consistency of each item. The test-retest reliability was determined using the FF-PR scores given by the parents in Group I one week apart. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to measure the construct validity. The Nordic Orofacial Screening Test (NOT-S), Dysphagia Disorder Survey (DDS), and the Turkish version of the Feeding-Swallowing Impact Survey (T-FS-IS) were used for the criterion validity of the FF-PR. The discriminant validity of the FF-PR was determined by comparing the FF-PR scores of the groups and using the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The content validity index was 0.92. The Cronbach's α was found to be high (test: 0.966, retest: 0.969). The FF-PR had an excellent chi-square fit (χ2/df = 123.075/127 p = 0.582) and according to the fit indices; the FF-PR was found to have a good fit. There was a low-moderate correlation between FF-PR and NOT-S (r = 0.335 - 0.462, p < 0.001) and DDS (r = 0.461 - 0.535, p < 0.001) and a moderate-high correlation between FF-PR and T-FS-IS (r = 0.501 - 0.807, p < 0.001). The FF-PR total and subscale scores were higher in Group I than in Group II. In conclusion, the FF-PR scale is a valid and reliable tool for measuring parental fear about feeding their child.","2025","Dysphagia"

This study aims to explore the relationship between IL-1R1 gene expression, serum IL-1R1 levels, and hsa-miR-19b-3p in relation to AA severity. Using a case-control design, we assessed 100 AA patients and 100 healthy controls, measuring serum IL-1R1 through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and analyzing IL-1R1 gene and hsa-miR-19b-3p expression levels via quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Bioinformatic analysis predicted a binding site for hsa-miR-19b-3p on the IL-1R1 gene, suggesting a regulatory role for this miRNA in AA pathology. Demonstrated significantly higher serum IL-1R1, IL-1R1 gene expression, and hsa-miR-19b-3p levels in AA patients compared to controls. Within the AA cohort, severe cases showed the highest levels, with notable correlations between serum IL-1R1, IL-1R1 gene expression, and hsa-miR-19b-3p. Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed robust diagnostic potential, with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.71, 0.73, and 0.76 for serum IL-1R1, hsa-miR-19b-3p, and IL-1R1 gene expression, respectively. Elevated IL-1R1 and hsa-miR-19b-3p levels are associated with AA and its severity, suggesting these markers have potential as diagnostic and prognostic indicators. These findings enhance the understanding of IL-1R1's role in AA and highlight potential molecular targets for future therapeutic approaches.","2025","Archives of dermatological research"

Early detection of CALs is challenging due to limitations in echocardiographic equipment (UCG). This study aimed to develop and validate an artificial intelligence algorithm to distinguish CALs in KD patients and support diagnostic decision-making at admission. A deep learning algorithm named KCPREDICT was developed using 24 features, including basic patient information, five classic KD clinical signs, and 14 laboratory measurements. Data were collected from patients diagnosed with KD between February 2017 and May 2023 at Shanghai Children's Medical Center. Patients were split into training and internal validation cohorts at an 80:20 ratio, and fivefold cross-validation was employed to assess model performance. Among the 1474 KD cases, the decision tree model performed best during the full feature experiment, achieving an accuracy of 95.42%, a precision of 98.83%, a recall of 93.58%, an F1 score of 96.14%, and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 96.00%.

This was a prospective case-control study involving Chinese women with a singleton pregnancy who underwent preterm PE screening at 11 + 0 to 13 + 6 weeks' gestation using the FMF triple test, between February 2020 and February 2023. Women identified as being at high risk (≥ 1:100) for preterm PE by the FMF triple test were matched 1:1 with women identified as low risk (< 1:100) for maternal age ± 3 years, maternal weight ± 5 kg and date of screening ± 14 days. Two-dimensional transthoracic echocardiography was performed at 12 + 0 to 15 + 6 weeks to evaluate maternal hemodynamic parameters (heart rate (HR), stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and systemic vascular resistance (SVR)). Maternal hemodynamic parameters were expressed as multiples of the median (MoM) values, determined by linear regression models to adjust for gestational age (GA) and MF. The distribution of log10 MoM values of maternal hemodynamic parameters in cases of PE and unaffected pregnancies, and the association between these hemodynamic parameters and GA at delivery, were assessed. The risks of preterm PE (delivery before 37 weeks) and any-onset PE (delivery at any time) were reassessed using Bayes' theorem after maternal hemodynamic parameters were added to the FMF triple test. The screening performance for preterm PE and any-onset PE was determined by the area under the receiver-operating-characteristics curve (AUC) and detection rate at a 10% fixed false-positive rate (FPR). Differences in AUC (ΔAUC) were assessed using DeLong's test. A total of 743 cases were analyzed, of whom 39 (5.2%) subsequently developed PE, including 29 (3.9%) cases of preterm PE and 10 (1.3%) cases of term PE. Mean log10 SVR MoM was significantly higher in cases of preterm PE and any-onset PE compared with unaffected pregnancies. Mean log10 SV MoM and log10 CO MoM were significantly lower in cases of preterm PE and any-onset PE compared with unaffected pregnancies. Mean log10 HR MoM was not significantly different between the study groups. Mean log10 CO MoM and log10 SVR MoM were not significantly correlated with GA at delivery in preterm PE and any-onset PE. For the prediction of preterm PE and any-onset PE, adding CO or SVR or replacing MAP with CO and SVR in the FMF triple test achieved an identical or greater AUC compared with the FMF triple test, but ΔAUC was not significantly different. In addition, adding CO or SVR or replacing MAP by CO and SVR in the FMF triple test did not improve the detection rate for preterm PE and any-onset PE at a fixed FPR of 10%. Women with preterm PE or any-onset PE exhibited increased SVR and decreased CO before the clinical manifestations of PE became apparent. These changes may serve as early indicators of cardiovascular maladaptation. However, assessment of maternal hemodynamics at 12 + 0 to 15 + 6 weeks does not enhance the screening performance for preterm PE and any-onset PE of these parameters. The FMF triple test remains superior to other biomarker combinations for predicting PE. © 2025 The Author(s).

Data were obtained from a prospective observational cohort of AMA pregnant women from the Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital in Shanghai, China. Singleton pregnancies with complete OGTT results at 24-28 weeks were selected and divided into training (70%) and validation (30%) sets. First-trimester predictors, including demographic, metabolic parameters, and clinical history, were evaluated for statistical significance. A multivariate logistic regression model was developed, with performance evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves and calibration plots. Predictors were primarily incorporated as categorical variables in a nomogram to enhance model convenience. A model using continuous predictors was also tested for comparison. A total of 1904 AMA women were included, with GDM incidence rates of 18.3% (243/1333) in the training set and 19.3% (110/571) in the validation set. Significant predictors for GDM diagnosis at 24-28 weeks included maternal age, GDM history, first-trimester fasting plasma glucose, mean arterial pressure, and triglyceride levels. The categorical model achieved an area under the ROC curve of 0.717 (95% CI: 0.682-0.753) in the training set and 0.702 (95% CI: 0.645-0.758) in the validation set. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test indicated good calibration (p = .97 in the training set; p = .66 in the validation set). The model with category and continuous predictors exhibited similar performance. This study developed and validated a practical early risk prediction nomogram for GDM in AMA women, using commonly available clinical data.

Sixty-five participants (median age at assessment of 56 years, 45% female) were recruited during their index presentation to the Royal Melbourne Hospital Neuropsychiatry Centre, a tertiary specialist service in Melbourne, Australia, and categorized as either early-onset Alzheimer's disease (n = 18), non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration (n = 23) or primary psychiatric disorders (n = 24). Levels of neurofilament light chain, glial fibrillary acidic protein and phosphorylated-tau 181, apolipoprotein E genotype and late-onset Alzheimer's disease polygenic risk scores were determined. Information-theoretic model selection identified discriminatory factors. Neurofilament light chain, glial fibrillary acidic protein and phosphorylated-tau 181 levels were elevated in early-onset Alzheimer's disease compared with other diagnostic categories. A multi-omic model selection identified that a combination of cognitive and blood biomarkers, but not the polygenic risk score, discriminated between early-onset Alzheimer's disease and primary psychiatric disorders (area under the curve ⩾ 0.975, 95% confidence interval: 0.825-1.000). Phosphorylated-tau 181 alone significantly discriminated between early-onset Alzheimer's disease and non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration causes (area under the curve = 0.950, 95% confidence interval: 0.877-1.00). Discriminating between early-onset Alzheimer's disease, non-Alzheimer's disease neurodegeneration and primary psychiatric disorders causes of young-onset neurocognitive symptoms is possible by combining cognitive profiles with blood biomarkers. These results support utilizing blood biomarkers for the work-up of young-onset neurocognitive symptoms and highlight the need for the development of a young-onset Alzheimer's disease-specific polygenic risk score.","2025","The Australian and New Zealand journal of psychiatry"

However, the function of METTL17 across pan-cancers, especially in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is still poorly understood. All original data were downloaded from TCGA, GTEx, HPA, UCSC databases and various data portals. First, we comprehensively analyzed RNA-seq data from the HPA database of 25 human tissues. An array of bioinformatics methods was employed to explore the potential oncogenic roles of METTL17, including analyzing its related prognosis, mutation, landscapes, tumor stemness index, immune cell infiltration, and other factors among different tumors. Additionally, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) was used to analyze pathways associated with METTL17 in HCC. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was performed on clinical samples to validate the differential expression of METTL17 in HCC and normal tissues. Ultimately, we constructed a METTL17-related risk-score model of HCC and validated its prognostic classification efficiency. Survival rates were calculated using the Kaplan-Meier method. Statistical significance was defined as P < 0.05. METTL17 was differentially expressed in various cancers. METTL17 maintained strong correlations with the cancer patient's prognosis, genetic alterations, tumor stemness index, and immune-infiltrated cells, etc. In addition, IHC experiments verified that METTL expression was significantly decreased in liver tissues of HCC patients compared to normal liver tissue. GESA analysis indicated METTL17 mainly involves oncogenic and immune-related pathways among HCC. MRPS5, CHCHD2, NCBP1, LRPPRC, DAP3, and BMS1 were included in a prognostic model based on METTL17's interaction networks. Kaplan-Meier survival analysis of the prognostic model showed that the overall survival (OS) of the low-risk group was significantly better than that of the high-risk group (P < 0.001). The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) of the 1-year, 3-year, and 5-year OS were 0.747, 0.671, and 0.631, respectively. METTL17 may serve as a novel prognostic marker and therapeutic target for human tumors, offering a theoretical foundation for formulating more effective and tailored clinical treatment options for cancers, particularly HCC.","2025","Cancer cell international"

Inflammation plays a pivotal role throughout the progression of DCM to heart failure, while age acts as a natural predisposing factor for all cardiovascular diseases. These two factors often interact, contributing to cardiac fibrosis, which is both a common manifestation and a pathogenic driver of adverse remodeling in DCM-induced heart failure. Bulk RNA-seq, single-cell RNA-seq, Mendelian randomization analysis, animal model construction, and BMP6 knockdown were utilized to identify and validate potential specific markers and targets for intervention in DCM heart failure. We found that DCM hearts exhibit pronounced inflammatory cell infiltration and fibrosis. Both bulk RNA-seq and single-cell RNA-seq analyses revealed aberrant BMP6 expression specifically in fibroblasts. The ROC curve underscores the high specificity of BMP6 in relation to DCM, while Mendelian randomization analysis further confirms BMP6 as a protective factor against DCM. Notably, BMP6 knockdown led to a decrease in SMAD6 expression and a marked elevation in COL1A1 expression levels, indicating its antifibrotic role.

The diagnosis of CVD was based on standardized medical condition questionnaires that incorporated participants' self-reported physician diagnoses. WWI (cm/√kg) is a continuous variable and calculated as waist circumference (WC, cm) divided by square root of body weight (kg). For analysis purposes, the participants were divided into four groups based on the quartiles (Q1 - Q4) of the WWI. The study's primary outcome was all-cause mortality in patients with CVD, with cardiovascular mortality as the secondary outcome, and sample weights and complex survey designs were used to ensure reliable, accurate results. The final analysis included 4,445 study participants. In the fully adjusted model, the highest quartile (WWI > 12.05 cm/√ kg) showed a higher all-cause mortality rate compared with the lowest quartile (WWI < 11.03 cm/√ kg) (HR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.82, P < 0.05). The risk of all-cause mortality increased with WWI and showed a linear association in patients with congestive heart failure, heart attack (P-overall < 0.05, P - nonlinear > 0.05); WWI was nonlinearly associated with the risk of all-cause mortality in patients with coronary heart disease and angina (P-overall < 0.05, P - nonlinear < 0.05). Survival curve analysis further showed that all cause and cardiovascular mortality were higher in the high WWI group (Q4) (P < 0.001). The time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve showed that WWI's area under the curves (AUC) for 5- and 10-year survival rates were 0.76 and 0.792 for all-cause mortality and 0.734 and 0.757 for CVD mortality. WWI's AUC were higher than those of body mass index (BMI) and WC (all P < 0.01). Our findings indicate that a high WWI is positively associated with an increased risk of all-cause mortality. Additionally, the high AUC values for WWI strengthen its potential as a meaningful prognostic marker, underscoring its utility in clinical practice for assessing long-term survival risk in patients with CVD.","2025","Diabetology & metabolic syndrome"

The primary outcome was the accuracy of lung ultrasound in predicting 3-day weaning failure, with the ROC curve used to determine the best LUS cutoff (sensitivity and specificity). Among 55 neonates, the pre-extubation LUS did not show statistical significance in predicting weaning failure (AUC 0.61; 95% CI: 0.46-0.76, p = 0,169). In the subgroup analysis, a score ≥ 4 suggests the need for ventilatory support after extubation (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.91, 95% CI: 0.80-1.0, p < 0.001) in neonates with GA ≥ 28 weeks. In extremely preterm infants, the pre-extubation LUS was not statistically significant in predicting weaning failure (AUC = 0.38, 95% CI: 0-0.77, p = 0.535). In contrast, CGA ≥ 28.7 weeks at extubation was predictor of successful weaning within 3 days (AUC = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.85-1.0, p < 0.001). LUS show promise in predicting weaning failure, though its accuracy may be limited in extremely preterm infants, highlighting the need for further well-powered studies. CGA at extubation also emerges as a key consideration in this population, warranting confirmation through robust future research. • Identifying the optimal timing for extubation is crucial, as both prolonged mechanical ventilation and failed extubation are linked to increased morbidity. • Lung ultrasound plays a well-established role in diagnosing various neonatal lung pathologies, allowing clinicians to make rapid, bedside decisions for the treatment of newborns. • LUS appears to be accurate in predicting weaning failure, though its accuracy may be lower in extremely preterm infants. • In extremely preterm infants, CGA may play an important role in extubation decision-making. • These findings are hypothesis-generating and warrant further investigation in future studies.","2025","European journal of pediatrics"

This study aimed to investigate the relationship between postoperative serum C-reactive protein (CRP) levels and the occurrence of PPAP after pancreaticoduodenectomy (PD). Consecutive patients who underwent PD between January 1, 2020, and May 31, 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. PPAP was defined according to the International Study Group for Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS) definitions. A Sankey diagram incorporating Fistula Risk Score (FRS), serum amylase levels, and serum CRP levels was further performed for the early iterative risk stratification of PPAP. A total of 601 patients were included in the analysis. Postoperative serum hyperamylasemia (POH) was observed in 268 patients (44.6 %), of whom 136 (16.7 %) developed PPAP after PD. Patients with serum CRP >100 mg/L on postoperative day (POD) 2 had a significantly higher incidence of PPAP (27.2 % vs. 2.3 %, p < 0.001). The highest Youden index was achieved with the cut-off value of 100 mg/L, with the area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.754 for predicting PPAP (sensitivity 91.8 %, specificity 59.0 %). Multivariate analysis revealed that body mass index (BMI) ≥24 (OR 2.09), estimated blood loss >200 mL (OR 1.70), and elevated serum CRP levels (OR 13.01) were independent risk factors for PPAP. Notably, patients with both POH and elevated serum CRP levels on POD 2 were classified as the high-risk group, exhibiting a remarkably high PPAP rate of 41.8 %. Serum CRP levels on POD 2 are strongly associated with the development of PPAP after PD. This finding has the potential to enable tailored postoperative management and pave the way for the anti-inflammation strategies targeting the early postoperative period.","2025","Pancreatology : official journal of the International Association of Pancreatology (IAP) ...

Matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP-9) has been proven to be a reliable indicator of dry eye inflammation. The aim of this study is to establish an Eu-time resolved fluorescence immunochromatography (Eu-TRFICO) method for quantitative detection of MMP-9 in human tear based upon widely used Schirmer strips. The Eu-TRFICO method for Schirmer strip-based tear MMP-9 measurements were optimized and assembled. The sensitivity, repeatability and homogeneity were evaluated using MMP-9 standard dilutions. The diagnostic and treatment monitoring performance were evaluated in both dry eye patients and normal subjects. The standard curve equation was y = 0.0037 + 8.0692/[1+ (x/188.322)-0.8972] (R2 = 0.99998), and the sensitivity was 0.25 ng/mL. The Schirmer strip-based MMP-9 measurements showed acceptable repeatability and homogeneity with different saturation length in both low and high standard solutions. A total of 162 participants (162 eyes) were enrolled in this study, including 41 normal and 121 dry eye subjects. This method exhibited a sensitivity of 74.17 % and specificity of 77.5 % for dry eye diagnosis, with an AUC value of 0.8275, and cutoff value of 150.67 ng/mL, using normal subjects as negative control. The tear MMP-9 concentrations monitored with this method correlated well with the therapeutic response in dry eye patients. This study developed Eu-TRFICO Schirmer strips with high sensitivity, specificity, precision, and satisfactory clinical testing performance, which provides a convenient and quantitative option for clinical testing of tear MMP-9 in dry eye patients.","2025","The ocular surface"

Traditional diagnostic approaches, such as blood cultures, are time-consuming. This limitation has encouraged the exploration of rapid prediction methodologies. Cellular Population Data (CPD), which provides detailed insights into white blood cell morphology and functionality, is a promising technique for the early detection of bacteremia. This study applied machine learning models to analyze laboratory data from hospitalized patients at risk of bacteremia from three hospitals. Using complete blood count (CBC), differential count (DC), and CPD, collected at various time intervals, we trained two sets of artificial intelligence models: one trained using data from patients in the Emergency Department (ED) and another specifically designed for and trained using data from a hospitalized cohort. We evaluated the performance of both models by applying them to the same hospitalized population and comparing their outcomes. The study encompassed analysis of over 66,000 CBC samples. The model tailored for hospitalized patients exhibited superior performance in bacteremia prediction across all cohorts compared with the ED-model, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.772 in the validation cohort from China Medical University Hospital and 0.808 and 0.843 in two other hospital cohorts. Notably, nearly half of the top fifteen important features identified by shapely additive explanations values were CPD parameters, underscoring the pivotal role of CPD in predictive models for bacteremia. Artificial intelligence models incorporating CPD data can accurately predict bacteremia in hospitalized patients. Models specifically trained on hospitalized patient data demonstrate enhanced performance over those based on ED data in predicting bacteremia occurrences. Future research must explore the clinical effects of these models, focusing on their potential to assist physicians in managing antibiotic use and patient health.","2025","International journal of medical informatics"

Indicated prevention programs targeting adolescents with mild symptoms have shown efficacy, yet the methods for identifying at-risk individuals need improvement. This study aims to evaluate the utility of Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR) in predicting the onset of MDD among non-depressed adolescents, compared to traditional screening methods. The study recruited 1462 Portuguese adolescents aged 13-16, who were assessed using various self-report measures and followed for two years. Participants were randomly divided into training (70%, N = 1023) and testing (30%, N = 439) samples. PLSR models were developed to predict the occurrence of a major depressive episode (MDE) within two years, using 331 variables. The model's performance was compared to the Children's Depression Inventory (CDI) in predicting MDE onset. The best-fitting PLSR model with two components explained 19.1% and 16.9% of the variance in the training and testing samples, respectively, significantly outperforming the CDI, which explained 7.7% of the variance. The area under the ROC curve was 0.78 for PLSR, compared to 0.71 for CDI. An empirically derived cut-off point was used to create dichotomous risk categories, and it showed a significant difference in MDE rates between predicted high-risk and low-risk groups. The balanced accuracy of the PLSR model was 0.77, compared to 0.65 for the CDI method. The PLSR model effectively identified adolescents at risk for developing MDD, demonstrating superior predictive power over the CDI. This study supports the potential utility of ML techniques (e.g., PLSR) in enhancing early identification and prevention efforts for adolescent depression.","2025","Journal of psychiatric research"

This study examines groundwater quality in the Nansi Lake Basin (NSLB), emphasizing nitrate (NO3--N) contamination. Utilizing 422 groundwater samples, it investigates hydrochemical dynamics and the impact of land use on groundwater composition. Key methods include hydrogeochemical analysis, PCA, and the Duncan comparison method. The innovative aspect lies in using Multilayer Perceptron Artificial Neural Networks (MLP-ANNs) to predict NO3--N contamination. The results showed that NO3--N levels ranged from 0.004 to 177.72 mg/L, with approximately 43.6 % of the samples exceeding the safe drinking water limit of 10 mg/L (WHO 2022). Substantial spatial variability in the concentrations of major ions within aquifers, with NO3--N exhibiting the most significant fluctuations. The factors responsible for the hydrochemical composition of groundwater include recharge sources, water-rock interaction, prevailing groundwater environment, land use patterns, and related anthropogenic activities. Notably, land use types, primarily farmland and rural areas, exhibited a strong association with NO3--N. The MLP-ANNs achieved high prediction accuracy for NO3--N, with an AUC of 0.85. The MLP-ANN model identified heightened susceptibility to nitrate contamination in the central and southeastern regions, characterized by dense shallow wells (<60 m). Key factors include nitrogen-based fertilizer overuse, agricultural runoff, domestic wastewater discharge, and septic system leakage. The vulnerability is exacerbated by highly permeable loose rock pore water systems underlying intensively cultivated agricultural lands. This study elucidates the complex interrelation between natural processes and anthropogenic activities that influence groundwater quality, providing valuable perspectives that could guide the formulation of policies and practices aimed at promoting sustainable groundwater utilization and environmental conservation.","2025","Journal of hazardous materials"

This retrospective single centre study investigated the relationship between age at loss of ambulation (LOA) and late stage left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) in 84 individuals (> 16 years old) with DMD taking glucocorticoid and ACE inhibitors treatment. Regression analyses showed a positive correlation between later age at LOA and higher LVEF in adulthood (linear regression estimate 1.49, 95 % CI: 0.13-2.84, p = 0.03). Each additional year of ambulation increased the odds of displaying a higher LVEF category (LVEF 40 %, 40 - 50 % or 50 %) by 35 % (p = 0.003). Sensitivity models excluding cardioprotective genotypes (absence of Dp116 isoform) and mild motor phenotypes (out of frame deletions amenable to skip exon 44 and 45) confirmed this association while models including age at respiratory impairment did not improve the model. Individuals who lost ambulation before age 11.92 (ROC AUC 0.73, 95 % CI: 0.60-0.85) reached a LVEF <40 % 5.21 years earlier than those who lost ambulation after that age (adjusted restricted mean survival time 19.08 vs 24.29 years, p < 0.001).

666,"39823592","The utility of routine intraoperative CSF during ventricular shunt insertion: a 10-year retrospective cohort study.","Ventricular shunt insertion is a common procedure in pediatric neurosurgical practice. In many areas of medicine there is a push toward rationalization of healthcare resources and a reduction in low-value tests or procedures. The intraoperative sampling of CSF at the time of shunt insertion is one traditional aspect of care that has not been rigorously evaluated. Additionally, the role of CSF cell counts and chemistry in predicting shunt dysfunction is often discussed but poorly studied. A recent meta-analysis found a correlation between elevated CSF protein levels and shunt failure in patients with tuberculous meningitis, but not other pathologies, which limits the generalizability of those findings to Western populations. The aims of this study were to assess the clinical utility of intraoperative CSF sampling during insertion of ventricular shunts and to describe any association of routine intraoperative CSF sample parameters with shunt failure or infection. A retrospective review of a prospectively maintained surgical database covering 10 years of consecutive cases from a quaternary Australian pediatric neurosurgical center serving a population of 5.3 million was conducted. Statewide electronic medical records were reviewed to collate data on demographics, postoperative imaging, CSF biochemistry, instances of shunt failure, shunt revisions, and mortality. Patients undergoing insertion of a new ventricular shunt were included, while all cases of shunt revision were excluded. During the study period, 1485 shunt procedures were performed, of which 427 involved the placement of a new ventriculoperitoneal shunt system. The mean patient age was 5.2 years (range premature-18 years). Of the 427 cases, 377 (88%) underwent routine CSF sampling. The most common indications for shunt revision were proximal catheter obstruction (51/173, 29%), followed by infection (29/173, 17%) and valve blockage (23/173, 13%). During the study period, 3 patients with existing intracranial hardware had overt ventriculitis identified at the time of intraoperative sampling, resulting in shunt removal. One patient with an existing ventricular reservoir had a delayed clinically significant infection identified on intraoperative cultures. Elevated CSF protein levels were associated with shunt failure during follow-up (area under the curve 0.625). The identified cutoff of 300 mg/L was significantly associated with a reduced time to shunt failure in both univariate and multivariate analyses. It may be reasonable to consider omission of routine intraoperative CSF sampling at the time of shunt insertion in patients without existing intracranial hardware. Elevated CSF protein levels are associated with a reduced time to shunt failure in a dose-dependent manner.","2025","Journal of neurosurgery. Pediatrics"

We used retrospective EHR data (derivation sample) and a prospective diabetes screening study (validation sample) to develop D-RISK. Logistic regression with backward selection was used to predict dysglycemia (HbA1c ≥5.7%) using diabetes risk factors consistently captured in structured EHR data. Model coefficients were converted to a points-based risk score. We report discrimination, sensitivity, and specificity and compare D-RISK to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) risk test and the ADA and United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) screening guidelines. The derivation cohort included 11,387 patients (mean age 48 years; 65% female; 42% Hispanic; 32% non-Hispanic Black; mean BMI 32; 29% with hypertension). D-RISK included age, race, BMI, hypertension, and random glucose. The area under curve (AUC) for the risk score was 0.75 (95% CI 0.74-0.76). In the validation screening study (n = 519), the AUC was 0.71 (95% CI 0.66-0.75) which was better than the ADA and USPSTF diabetes screening guidelines (AUC = 0.52 and AUC = 0.58, respectively; P < 0.001 for both). Discrimination was similar to the ADA risk test (AUC = 0.67) using patient-reported data to supplement EHR data, although D-RISK was more sensitive (75% vs. 61%) at the recommended screening thresholds. Designed for use in EHR, D-RISK performs better than commonly used screening guidelines and risk scores and may help detect undiagnosed cases of dysglycemia in clinical practice.","2025","Diabetes care"

However, no biomarker reflecting RVD is available for routine clinical use. Proteomic analysis of myocardium from the left ventricle and right ventricle (RV) of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction with (n=10) and without RVD (n=10) who underwent heart transplantation was performed. Concentrations of 2 ECM (extracellular matrix) proteins with the highest myocardial upregulation in RVD, FMOD (fibromodulin) and FBLN5 (fibulin-5), were assayed in the blood and tested in a separate cohort of patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (n=232) to test for the association of the 2 proteins with RV function and long-term outcomes. Multivariable linear regression revealed that plasma concentrations of both FMOD and FBLN5 were significantly associated with RV function regardless of the RV function assessment method. No association of FMOD or FBLN5 with left ventricular dysfunction, cardiac index, body mass index, diabetes status, or kidney function was found. Plasma levels of FMOD and FBLN5 were significantly associated with patient outcomes (P=0.005; P=0.004). Area under the curve analysis showed that the addition of FBLN5 or FMOD to RV function assessment had a significantly higher area under the curve after 4 years of follow-up (0.653 and 0.631, respectively) compared with RV function alone (0.570; P<0.05 for both). Similarly, the combination of MAGGIC (Meta-Analysis Global Group in Chronic Heart Failure) score, FBLN5, and FMOD had a significantly larger area under the curve (0.669) than the combination of MAGGIC score+RVD grade (0.572; P=0.02). The Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated that patients with the elevation of both FMOD and FBLN5 (ie, FMOD >64 ng/mL and FMOD >27 ng/mL) had a worse prognosis than those with the elevation of either FBLN5 or FMOD (P=0.03) demonstrating the additive prognostic value of both proteins. Our study proposes that circulating levels of FMOD and FBLN5 may serve as new biomarkers of RVD in patients with heart failure with reduced ejection fraction.","2025","Circulation. Heart failure"

The utility of combination use of LRG and C-reactive protein (CRP) has not been reported. This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of LRG in combination with CRP to predict endoscopic activity. A single-centre, retrospective, cross-sectional study was conducted. Patients with CD who had serum LRG concentrations measured at least once between June 2020 and May 2021 were enrolled. Clinical activity was evaluated with the Harvey-Bradshaw Index (HBI). Spearman's rank correlation coefficient (rs) was used to analyse the correlations between the HBI, LRG concentrations and CRP concentrations. In patients undergoing ileocolonoscopy or balloon-assisted enteroscopy within 60 days before or after LRG measurement, endoscopic activity was evaluated with the simple endoscopic score for Crohn's disease (SES-CD). The diagnostic performance of LRG and CRP for endoscopic activity was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. Four hundred and eighty-nine measurements in 343 patients were analysed. Although a strong correlation was found between LRG and CRP concentrations (rs = 0.75), the HBI did not well correlate with LRG or CRP concentrations. Endoscopic activity was analysed in 56 patients. In diagnosing endoscopically moderate to severe activity (SES-CD > 6), the area under the ROC curve of LRG was greater than that of CRP (0.74 vs. 0.63; p = .037). The optimal cut-off value estimated by Youden's index was 15.5 µg/mL for LRG, and 0.13 mg/dL for CRP. LRG and CRP concentrations were considered positive when they were above these cut-off values, and the sensitivity and specificity for an SES-CD > 6 were 58.3% and 93.8%, respectively. Dual positivity of LRG and CRP showed the highest specificity. Combination use of dual positive LRG and CRP is useful for diagnosing endoscopically moderate to severe disease.","2025","Annals of medicine"

We selected patients from the post COVID care study (PCC-study) with data on their ability to work. To identify factors associated with ITW, we compared PCC patients with and without ITW. For constructing a predictive model, we selected nine clinical parameters: hospitalization during the acute SARS-CoV-2 infection, WHO severity of acute infection, presence of somatic comorbidities, presence of psychiatric comorbidities, age, height, weight, Karnofsky index, and symptoms. The model was trained to predict ITW twelve months after baseline using TensorFlow Decision Forests. Its performance was investigated using cross-validation and an independent testing dataset. In total, 259 PCC patients were included in this analysis. We observed that ITW was associated with dyslipidemia, worse patient reported outcomes (FSS, WHOQOL-BREF, PHQ-9), a higher rate of preexisting psychiatric conditions, and a more extensive medical work-up.

A prospective cohort pilot study.","Differentiating infectious from non-infectious respiratory syndromes is critical in emergency settings. This study aimed to assess whether nCD64 and mCD169 exhibit specific distributions in patients with respiratory infections (viral, bacterial, or co-infections) and to evaluate their diagnostic accuracy compared to non-infectious conditions. A prospective cohort study enrolled 443 consecutive emergency department patients with respiratory syndromes, categorized into four groups: no infection group (NOIG), bacterial infection group (BIG), viral infection group (VIG), and co-infection group (COING). Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate nCD64 and mCD169's association with diagnostic groups and estimate their predictive accuracy. 290 patients were included in VIG, 53 in BIG, 46 in COING, and 54 in NOIG. nCD64 was associated with bacterial infections and co-infections (p = 2.73 × 10- 16 and p = 8.83 × 10- 11, respectively), but not viral infections. mCD169 was associated with viral infections and co-infections (p = < 2 × 10- 16 and p = 2.45 × 10- 13, respectively), but not bacterial infections. The sensitivity and specificity of nCD64 for detecting bacterial infections were 0.75 and 0.84 (AUC = 0.83), respectively, while for mCD169 they were 0.87 and 0.91 (AUC = 0.92), respectively, for diagnosing viral infections. A diagnostic algorithm incorporating fever, nasopharyngeal swabs for the main respiratory virus, C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and mCD169 reached an accuracy of 0.79 (95% CI 0.72-0.85) in distinguishing among the different groups. nCD64 and MCD169 seem valuable for distinguishing between bacterial and viral respiratory infections. Integrating these biomarkers into diagnostic algorithms could enhance diagnostic accuracy aiding patient management in emergency settings.","2025","Infection"

Preoperative screening via endoscopy and imaging examinations could help identify patients who may potentially achieve a complete response after neoadjuvant combination immunotherapy. This study aims to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of endoscopic and imaging examinations in predicting pathological complete response after neoadjuvant combination immunotherapy. This single-center, retrospective, observational study included patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer by biopsy between 2015 and 2023 at a tertiary referral center. The main outcome measures included endoscopic examination, imaging findings, and pathological results after neoadjuvant combination immunotherapy. This study included 36 patients with locally advanced proficient mismatch repair colorectal cancer. Postoperative pathology revealed that 17 patients (47.2%) achieved a complete response (ypT0N0). The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of the endoscopic ypT0N0 diagnosis were 62.5%, 80.0%, and 80.6%, respectively; those of imaging-based ypT0N0 diagnosis were 43.8%, 100%, and 75.0%, respectively; and those of the combined diagnosis were 37.5%, 100%, and 72.2%, respectively. The areas under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for the endoscopic and imaging ypT0N0 diagnoses were 0.768 and 0.706, respectively. The specificities of endoscopy and imaging for diagnosing complete response after neoadjuvant combination immunotherapy for colorectal cancer were high; however, sensitivities were low. Therefore, radical surgery should still be recommended for patients with an incomplete response based on either examination. Larger scale studies are required to determine if a watch-and-wait strategy is suitable for patients with a complete response based on these two examinations.","2025","Techniques in coloproctology"

Currently, the evaluation of its efficacy is primarily restricted to clinical indicators, with a notable deficiency in imaging evaluation methodologies. In recent years, several studies have investigated the application of 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT for the classification of PA. However, there is a scarcity of specific research investigating the role of PET/CT in the evaluation of efficacy of this condition. Consequently, this study aims to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of SAAE in patients with PA using 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT, with the objective of establishing imaging evaluation methodologies for assessing PA patients post-SAAE treatment. Of the 27 patients, 2 achieved complete clinical remission, while 25 experienced partial remission. Biochemically, 13 patients attained complete remission, 13 had partial remission, and 1 did not. For patients with aldosterone-producing adenoma, both visual and semi-quantitative analyses of PET/CT effectively assessed changes in radioactive uptake of the lesion. For idiopathic hyperaldosteronism patients, PET/CT parameters were more effective than visual analysis in evaluating SAAE efficacy. A significant difference in the ΔTLR-40 min parameter was observed across biochemical outcomes (P = 0.041), with patients having ΔTLR-40 min ≥ 0.07 showing better outcomes (AUC = 0.789, P = 0.041). 68Ga-Pentixafor PET/CT enables timely assessment of therapeutic outcomes in patients with PA following SAAE, thereby improving clinical decision-making and patient management.","2025","EJNMMI research"

Twenty-five mandibular incisors were prepared to 45/.04 (size/taper) at working length. Teeth were placed in a partially dentate mandible and single gutta-percha cones of seven sizes were placed at length, one at a time, for image acquisition with a photon-counting sensor, two CBCT protocols (90µm3, 120µm3) and two CMOS sensors. Three calibrated observers assessed images for gap presence. Sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, AUC, and agreement with gold standard were determined using ANOVA and Tukey test (p ≤ 0.05). Photon-counting sensor showed superior sensitivity and accuracy (88.47%, 81.57%), significantly higher than the CBCT protocols (50.70-56.33%, 45.87-53.17%). Contrarily, the photon-counting sensor showed the lowest specificity (40.27%), significantly lower than the CBCT protocols (90.27%, 97.23%). CMOS sensors showed sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy between 72.23-74.53%, not differing from other modalities. All intraoral sensors showed AUC around 82.87-84.03%, significantly higher than CBCT protocol 120µm3 (74.07%). The file size was inversely related to gap size and percentual agreement with gold standard. CMOS sensors showed consistent results, while the photon-counting sensor had the highest sensitivity but lacked specificity. CBCT protocols excelled in specificity but had lower sensitivity. Novel photon-counting sensors and CBCT imaging provided no significant advantage over conventional sensors in assessing gaps as an indicator of quality of root canal filling. Furthermore, smaller gaps were more difficult to detect, regardless of the imaging technique used.","2025","Dento maxillo facial radiology"

In this study, we analysed the clinical data of the included patients. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify independent risk factors for cognitive impairment after HSCT in patients with malignant haematological diseases, and a risk prediction model was constructed. Multiple cohorts of patients with haematological malignancies after HSCT (282 cases) from the Affiliated Hospital of Xuzhou Medical University and the First People's Hospital of Yancheng City between April 2019 and February 2022, and patients from the Affiliated Huaian No.1 People's Hospital of Nanjing Medical University between March 2022 and July 2023 were used for external validation. Logistic regression analysis was performed to develop the predictive model. The predictive value and consistency of the model were evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) and calibration method, respectively. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was performed to access the utility of the model. Approximately half (52.26%) of the patients in the study developed mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Older age, allogeneic HSCT, anxiety, graft-versus-host disease, and longer hospital stay were associated with a higher risk of developing MCI. ROC curve analysis confirmed the sound performance of the predictive model and external validation, with AUC of 0.897 and 0.789 respectively. The direction of the calibration curves of the training and validation sets is closer to the diagonal (ideal curve), indicating good model consistency; the DCA curves also show that the model has good predictive ability and stability. We conclude that it is possible to predict mild cognitive impairment with readily available, mostly pretransplant predictors. The accuracy of the risk prediction models can be improved for use in clinical practice, possibly by adding pretransplant patient-reported functioning and comorbidities.","2025","Supportive care in cancer : official journal of the Multinational Association of Supportive Care in Cancer"

Given the implications of these infections and the current paucity of risk calculators utilizing machine learning (ML), this study aimed to develop an ML algorithm that could accurately identify risk factors for developing a PJI following primary THA using a national database. A total of 51,053 patients who underwent primary THA between 2013 and 2020 were identified using the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) database. Demographic, preoperative, intraoperative, and immediate postoperative outcomes were collected. Five ML models were created. The receiver operating characteristic curves, the area under the curve (AUC), calibration plots, slopes, intercepts, and Brier scores were evaluated. The histogram-based gradient boosting (HGB) model demonstrated good PJI discriminatory ability with an AUC of 0.88. The test-specific metrics supported the model's performance and validation in predicting PJI (calibration curve slope: 0.79; intercept: 0.32; Brier score: 0.007). The top five predictors of PJI were the length of stay (> 3 days), patient weight at the time of surgery (> 94.3 kg), an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) class of 4 or higher, preoperative platelet count (< 249,890/mm3), and preoperative sodium (< 139.5 mEq/L). This study developed a highly specific ML model that could predict patient-specific PJI development following primary THA.

The model showed strong prognostic performance in 2088 newly diagnosed MM samples and predicted response to combination therapy (daratumumab, carfilzomib, lenalidomide, and dexamethasone) in patients who failed or relapsed from bortezomib-containing regimens, with an AUC of 0.9. It distinguished between smoldering MM and MM (cutoff: - 0.45) and between MM and plasma cell leukemia (cutoff: 0.0857). Single-cell analysis revealed higher risk scores at relapse. Combining MM cell lines and sample data, we identified potential drugs and targets (ADAT2 and NUP153) effective against high-risk MM. Integrating the m6A risk model with the International Staging System (ISS) enhanced stratification accuracy.

In this study, we used bootstrapped survival trees to identify a combination of biomarkers to predict CKD progression in children. The CKiD Cohort Study prospectively enrolled children 6 months to 16 years old with an eGFR of 30-90 ml/min/1.73m2. We measured biomarkers in stored plasma and urine collected 5 months after study enrollment. The primary outcome of CKD progression was a composite of 50% eGFR decline or kidney failure. We constructed a regression tree-based model for predicting the time to the composite event, using a panel of clinically relevant biomarkers with empirically derived thresholds, in addition to conventional risk factors. Of the 599 children included, the median age was 12 years [IQR, 8 - 15], 371 (62%) were male, baseline urine protein to creatinine ratio was 0.33 [IQR: 0.12 - 0.95] mg/mg, and baseline eGFR was 53 [IQR, 40 - 66] ml/min/1.73m2. Overall, 205 (34%) children reached the primary outcome of CKD. A single regression tree-based model using the most informative predictors with data driven biomarker thresholds suggested a final set of 4 prognosis groups. In the final model, urine albumin/creatinine was the variable with the highest importance, and along with urine EGF/creatinine identified the highest risk group of 24 children, 100% of whom developed CKD progression at a median time of 1.3 years [95% CI: 1.0, 1.7]. When the regression tree-derived risk group classifications were added to prediction models including the clinical risk factors, the C-statistic increased from 0.76 [95%CI: 0.71 - 0.80] to 0.85 [95%CI: 0.81 - 0.88]. Using regression tree-based methods, we identified a biomarker panel of urine albumin/creatinine, urine EGF/creatinine, plasma KIM-1, and eGFR which significantly improved discrimination for CKD progression.","2025","Journal of the American Society of Nephrology : JASN"

We analyzed data from 302 stroke patients undergoing urgent CEA or CAS between 2015 and 2023 at a tertiary Comprehensive Stroke Center. Predictors included: (1) stroke severity (NIH Stroke Scale, NIHSS), (2) time to intervention (≤48 hours), (3) thrombolysis use, and (4) frailty risk score. Two-way interactions were included to enhance generalizability without overfitting. Multiple models were constructed and selected based on the area under the ROC curve (AUC). The primary endpoint was discharge neurological functional independence (mRS ≤2). Presenting clinical factors and neurological outcomes data from 302 patients undergoing urgent CEA and CAS during the index hospitalization from 2015 to 2023 at a tertiary Comprehensive Stroke Center formed the model's foundation. Most patients (72.8%, 220/302) were discharged functionally independent (mRS ≤ 2). The combined 30-day rate of stroke, death, and MI was 8.3% (25/302); 6.5% (14/214) for CEA alone, and 12.5% (11/88) for CAS. The model, incorporating thrombolysis, time to intervention, stroke severity (NIHSS), and frailty risk, correctly predicted 93% of functional independence outcomes (AUC 0.808). We present a novel model using four clinical factors-stroke severity, time to intervention, thrombolysis use, and frailty risk-to predict functional neurologic independence with 93% accuracy in patients undergoing urgent carotid interventions for acute stroke. This high predictive capability can enhance clinical decision-making and improve patient outcomes by identifying those most likely to benefit from timely carotid revascularization.","2025","Journal of the American College of Surgeons"

We identified 12 candidate methylation markers to distinguish normal vs. abnormal esophagus. These 12 markers were first assayed in 21-paired matched NDBE-normal esophageal tissues, then assessed in a case-control study of 234 esophageal samples collected using a sponge-capsule device. A classification algorithm was developed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) in a 199-patient training set and tested in an independent 35-patient test set. Twelve markers (A1BG, C9orf50, cg00720137, FLI1, GRAMD1B, HOXB13, IRF4, KCNQ3, NTNG1, SPX, TBC1D30, and USP44) were significantly hypermethylated (i.e., all P<0.05) in BE vs. matched normal esophageal biopsies. A discriminatory three-gene LASSO panel (USP44, TBCD1D30, NELL1), adjusted for age and sex, accurately distinguished HGD or EAC from normal control patients in both training (AUC=0.911, 95%CI=0.863-0.959) and test (AUC=0.969, 95%CI=0.911-1.00) sets. In normal vs. NDBE/LGD/HGD/EAC patients, this algorithm exhibited AUCs of 0.862 (95%CI=0.812-0.912) and 0.864 (95%CI=0.745-0.982) in training and test sets, respectively.

Atlases were considered generalisable for a risk factor if the area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) were not significantly different (p>0.05) between internal (within-cohort) and external (cross-cohort) cases. LV mass and volume indices were differed significantly between cohorts, even in age-matched and sex-matched cases without risk factors, partly reflecting different core lab analysis protocols. For the UKB atlas, internal and external discriminative performance were not significantly different for hypertension (AUC: 0.77 vs 0.76, p=0.37), diabetes (AUC: 0.79 vs 0.77, p=0.48), hypercholesterolaemia (AUC: 0.76 vs 0.79, p=0.38) and smoking (AUC: 0.69 vs 0.67, p=0.18).

Both AKI and RRT are linked to an increased risk of mortality. This study aims to evaluate the risk factors associated with the need for RRT in patients undergoing VV-ECMO. Methods: This is a retrospective case-control study involving patients on VV-ECMO therapy admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) between 2019 and 2023. Patients on VV ECMO support, with or without RRT, were included and their severity scores and associated mortality were calculated. A multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed to assess the variable RRT using odds ratios (OR) with their corresponding confidence intervals (CI) for the outcome variables. Results: A total of 192 subjects were included, with a mortality rate of 39.6%. Of these, 68.7% were male, with an average ICU stay of 25.1 days and a need for RRT in 19.7% of cases. The multivariate analysis independently associated the use of vasopressors with RRT norepinephrine OR 5.61 (95% CI, 1.64-19.1) and vasopressin OR 4.64 (95% CI, 2.15-10.0)). An increase in creatinine levels before ECMO support is associated with an increased risk OR 2.21 (95% CI 1.54-3.18), and 24 h after ECMO support, the risk rises further adjusted odds ratio (AOR) 3.32 (95% IC 1.55-7.09). The accuracy of severity scores presented weak discrimination and similar behavior, except for DEOx for the primary outcome, with an AUC of 0.79 (95% CI, 0.72-0.87), and APACHE II with an AUC of 0.68 (95% CI, 0.59-0.78). Conclusions: The prediction of RRT in patients on VV-ECMO support was superior for DEOx, which is influenced by the use of vasopressors, creatinine levels, and platelet transfusion prior to cannulation. This could be useful for predicting early interventions in this patient population.","2025","Journal of intensive care medicine"

692,"39818771","MOCapsNet: Multiomics Data Integration for Cancer Subtype Analysis Based on Dynamic Self-Attention Learning and Capsule Networks.","Background and Objective: With the rapid development of the accumulation of large-scale multiomics data sets, integrating various omics data to provide a thorough study from multiple perspectives can significantly provide stronger support for precise treatment of diseases. However, due to the complexity of multiomics data, issues of feature redundancy and noise often do not receive sufficient attention when processing high-dimensional data. Moreover, simple concatenation strategies may overlook the correlations between different omics data, failing to effectively capture the unique information inherent in multiomics data. Meanwhile, deep neural networks often rely on complex structures and numerous parameters for training and inference, making their internal feature representations and decision-making processes difficult to interpret. Methods: We propose an interpretable multiomics data integration method for cancer subtype classification, named MOCapsNet, based on self-attention and capsule networks. Specifically, the self-attention confidence learning module is implemented to assess the feature information within each omic and to assign weights to the embedded representations of various groups, resulting in more targeted integrated information. Furthermore, the capsule network structure is employed for the final cancer classification task. Results: The model achieved strong performance on both tasks: 87.8% accuracy on the BRCA multiclassification data set and 83.6% accuracy with an AUC of 88.8% on the LGG data set. Conclusions: The proposed framework has undergone extensive testing on omics data sets, consistently proving its effectiveness in integrating multiomics data. It improves classification accuracy while enhancing the interpretability of results by fully utilizing the feature information.","2025","Journal of chemical information and modeling"

The systematic review aimed to summarize the evidence for voice analysis applications in BD, examining (1) the predictive validity of voice quality outcomes for mood state detection, and (2) the correlation between voice parameters and clinical symptom scales. A PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Library search was carried out by two investigators for publications investigating voice quality in BD according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) statements. Studies were assessed using the modified methodological index for non-randomized studies (MINORS). Of the 400 identified publications, 16 studies met the inclusion accounting for 575 BD patients. Machine learning approaches were implemented in 87.5% of studies, with classification accuracies ranging from 70.9% to 96.9%. Manic state detection showed the strongest predictive validity [area under the curve (AUC) up to 0.89], while depression detection demonstrated moderate performance (AUC: 0.66-0.78). Individual-specific models outperformed population-level approaches (correlation coefficients: 0.78 versus 0.44). Voice quality showed significant correlations with standardized clinical scales, particularly Young Mania Rating Scale and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (normalized root mean square errors: 1.985 and 3.945, respectively). Prosodic features were examined in 81.25% of studies, with pitch consistently elevated during manic episodes. MINORS varied from 10 to 14, with notable limitations in sample size calculations and blinding procedures. Voice quality is a promising biomarker in BD, particularly for manic state detection and individualized monitoring. While controlled settings showed strong performance, naturalistic applications yielded more modest results. Future research should focus on standardizing protocols across different environments and conducting large-scale longitudinal studies with robust methodological controls.","2025","Journal of voice : official journal of the Voice Foundation"

This study identified key genes linked to this resistance using multi-omics approaches to benefit more patients. We selected a prospective cohort of 54 AD treated with Dupilumab from the GEO database. After identifying resistant genes via WGCNA and differential expression analysis, we used machine learning techniques to screen key genes and develop a predictive model. It was found that four key genes (AP2M1, BMP4, DNM1, and RHEB) were identified, showing excellent diagnostic performance for Dupilumab resistance (AUC = 0.832-0.861, P < 0.05) and validated in AD patients via RT-qPCR (P < 0.05). Among them, AP2M1 was significantly correlated with the clinical severity of AD (R = 0.5,P = 0.04) and identified as a potential risk factor (HR = 13.45, 95%CI(1.71-105.65), P = 0.02). The results of immunohistochemistry also revealed overexpression of AP2M1 in AD tissue (P = 0.002). Additionally, immune infiltration analysis suggested that AP2M1-mediated Dupilumab resistance may involve mast cells (R = -0.51, P = 0.02), which also supported by single-cell analysis. And we constructed a regulatory network of AP2M1. Finally, we explored the drug Fostamatinib, targeting AP2M1.

We retrospectively analyzed 62 patients diagnosed with acute lower extremity DVT who underwent CDT between March 2019 and December 2022. Plasma D-dimer levels were measured before CDT, at regular intervals after CDT, and at the end of CDT. Lower limb venography was performed every 2 days during CDT to assess the thrombus clearance rate and level of thrombus dissolution. Statistical analyses were conducted to observe the D-dimer concentration changes and analyze the correlation between D-dimer concentration and thrombus clearance rate. Additionally, a receiver operating characteristic curve was constructed to determine the diagnostic performance of D-dimer in assessing the efficacy of thrombolysis, including the calculation of the area under the curve, sensitivity, specificity, and optimal cut-off value. During CDT for acute lower extremity DVT, plasma D-dimer levels rapidly increased, peaking on CDT day 1, and then gradually decreased, followed by a rapid decline, but remained slightly elevated compared with normal levels. There was a positive correlation between D-dimer levels and thrombolysis efficacy (r = 0.809; P = .00). The linear regression equation for this correlation was Y = 0.161 + 0.028X. The area under the curve of D-dimer was 0.95, with a cut-off value of 9.935 mg/L (sensitivity, 93.2%; specificity, 95.4%).

This study aimed to explore the pathological changes of whole-brain functional networks in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) through microstate analysis and further to explore its potential value as an auxiliary diagnostic index. Forty-eight OCD patients (33 with more than moderate anxiety symptoms, 15 with mild anxiety symptoms) and 52 healthy controls (HCs) were recruited. Brain activities during eyes-closed period were collected using 64-channel electroencephalography. The differences in microstate features between OCD patients and HCs were compared, and the relationship between the microstate features and clinical symptoms were explored. Key microstate features were selected for machine learning modeling to achieve targeted classifications. The probability of transition from microstate B to C was significantly lower in OCD patients compared to HCs, and the obsessive thoughts factor scores were significantly correlated with the duration of microstate A, the occurrence of microstate B, and the transition probability from microstate C to B. The occurrence rate of microstate C was significantly negatively correlated with the Hamilton rating scale for anxiety (HAMA) scores. The AUC (Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve) of the machine learning model in the test set classification between the above two groups and between OCD patients with more than moderate/mild anxiety symptoms could achieve 70.43% and 77.13%, respectively. EEG microstate characteristics were altered in OCD patients, and these changes were closely associated with obsessive thoughts and anxiety symptoms. Besides, the machine learning classification model based on microstate features has limited ability to identify OCD, and further optimization on this classification approach is still needed in the future.","2025","Journal of psychiatric research"

Emerging imaging markers, such as the analysis along the perivascular space (ALPS) index and choroid plexus volume (CPV), may provide insights into glymphatic function, but their relevance to ALS remains unclear. To assess glymphatic dysfunction in ALS patients using the ALPS index and CPV. In this prospective single-center study, we analyzed 51 ALS patients and 51 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC). The ALPS index was calculated using diffusion tensor imaging, and 3D T1-weighted MRI was used for automated estimation of CPV and its fraction (CPV/total intracranial volume). Diagnostic performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Correlations between imaging markers and clinical parameters were also examined. ALS patients had a significantly lower ALPS index (ALS: 1.45 ± 0.15; HC: 1.55 ± 0.16; p = 0.002) and higher CPV fraction (ALS: 0.12 ± 0.04 %; HC: 0.10 ± 0.02 %; p < 0.001).

However, no prior studies have examined the relationship between Lp-PLA2 and diabetic peripheral neuropathy (DPN) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). This research aims to explore the potential association between Lp-PLA2 and DPN. This retrospective study included 880 hospitalized patients with T2DM treated between March 2024 and August 2024 at Nanjing First Hospital. To assess the relationship between Lp-PLA2 and DPN, multiple logistic regression models were applied. The study also utilized restricted cubic spline (RCS) modeling, segmented regression, stratified analysis, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve assessments. Patients diagnosed with DPN exhibited elevated Lp-PLA2 levels compared to those without DPN. Even after adjusting for multiple variables, Lp-PLA2 was independently associated with a higher likelihood of DPN (odds ratio [OR] 1.011, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1.008-1.014, P < 0.001). The RCS analysis revealed a nonlinear association, with an inflection point at 215.8 ng/mL. In ROC curve analysis, the area under the curve (AUC) for Lp-PLA2 was 0.664, while the combined indicator AUC was 0.739. Serum Lp-PLA2 levels show a significant correlation with the presence of DPN in patients with T2DM. These findings suggest that Lp-PLA2 could serve as a valuable biomarker for identifying patients at risk for DPN, emphasizing the need for close monitoring of T2DM individuals with elevated Lp-PLA2 to mitigate the risk of developing DPN and associated adverse health outcomes.","2025","Journal of diabetes and its complications"

Predictive performance using conjunctive (AND)/disjunctive (OR) rule-based algorithms was assessed. Seven machine learning models were trained on Malaysia data and evaluated on both Malaysia and Singapore cohorts. 5519 samples were collected from the University Malaya Medical Centre. Small-for-gestational-age infants exhibit significantly lower nuchal thickness (small-for-gestational-age: 4.57 [1.04] mm, appropriate-for-gestational-age: 4.86 [1.06] mm, p < 0.001). Implementing disjunctive rule (nuchal thickness < 10th centile or estimated fetal weight < 10th centile) significantly improved small-for-gestational-age prediction across all growth charts, with balanced accuracy gains of 5.83% in Malaysia (p < 0.05) and 7.75% in Singapore. The best model for predicting small-for-gestational-age was: logistic regression with five variables (abdominal circumference, femur length, nuchal thickness, maternal age, and ultrasound-confirmed gestational age), which achieved an area under the curve of 0.75 for Malaysia cohorts; support vector machine with all variables, achieved area under the curve of 0.81 for Singapore cohorts.

Therefore, the aim of this study was to examine the possibility and risk factors of developing severe AP in HTG-AP. Data from patients with an established diagnosis of AP were collected from January 2013 to December 2023 using a predesigned data collection form and were gathered from 5 tertiary cross-regional centers of China. HTG-AP was defined as serum triglyceride levels >500 mg/dL and excluded other etiologies. The possibility and risk factors of severe AP were assessed by multivariable logistic regressions after adjusting potential confounders. A prediction model was established and validated. Between 2013 and 2023, we identified a total of 6,996 patients with AP, of whom 4,378 were included in the final analysis. Compared with other etiologies, patients with HTG-AP had a higher risk of developing severe AP (odds ratio: 1.897; 95% confidence interval: 1.380-2.608; P < 0.001) and organ failure. HTG-AP patients showed higher possibility for developing respiratory and circulation failure but renal failure compared with other etiologies. In HTG-AP patients, risk factors of severe AP included age, fasting blood glucose, white blood cell counts, and presence of pleural effusion. TG level was found not significantly associated with severity in HTG-AP patients. A prediction model incorporating these risk factors demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.837 in the training and 0.883 in the testing set, with adequate calibration.

This study aimed to assess the prevalence of co-infections among hospitalized patients with SFTS, characterize isolated pathogens, and evaluate demographics, clinical features, and laboratory variations to identify potential risk factors for co-infections. In a cohort of 78 SFTS patients categorized into co-infection and non-co-infection groups, 44.9% (35/78) experienced co-infections, with a 25.7% mortality rate in that subgroup. Pulmonary and bloodstream infections, particularly fungal infections, were most common, and earlier onset of co-infections correlated with higher fatality. Univariable logistic regression identified significant risk factors, followed by multivariable analysis to determine independent predictors. Changes in mental status, hemorrhage, deep venous or arterial catheterization, mechanical ventilation, activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) > 55 s, albumin < 37.5 g/L, interleukin-6 > 18.700 pg/mL, and interleukin-10 > 21.300 pg/mL emerged as significant risk factors, with hemorrhagic symptoms and low albumin remaining independent predictors.

As mortality rates continue to rise, predicting cancer survival using multimodal data-including histopathological images, genomic data, and clinical information-has become increasingly crucial. However, extracting effective predictive features from this complex data has posed challenges for survival analysis due to the high dimensionality and heterogeneity of histopathology images and genomic data. Furthermore, existing methods often lack sufficient interaction between intra- and inter-modal features, significantly impacting model performance. To address these challenges, we developed a deep learning-based multimodal feature fusion model, MultiDeepsurv, designed to predict the survival of gastric cancer patients by integrating histopathological images, clinical data, and gene expression data. Our approach includes a two-branch hybrid network, GLFUnet, which leverages the attention mechanism for enhanced pathology image representation learning. Additionally, we employ a graph convolutional neural network (GCN) to extract features from gene expression data and clinical information. To capture the correlations between different modalities, we utilize the SFusion fusion strategy that employs a self-attention mechanism to learn potential correlations across modalities. Finally, these deeply processed features are fed into Cox regression models for an end-to-end survival analysis.

Liquid biopsy that discriminates tumor-related biomarkers in body fluids has emerged as an attractive technique for early-stage and accurate diagnosis. Exosomes, carrying membrane and cytosolic information from original tumor cells, impart themselves endogeneity and heterogeneity, which offer extensive and unique advantages in the field of liquid biopsy for cancer differential diagnosis. Herein, we demonstrate a Gramian angular summation field and MobileNet V2 (GASF-MobileNet)-assisted surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) technique for analyzing exosomes, aimed at precise diagnosis of lung cancer. Specifically, a composite substrate was synthesized for SERS detection of exosomes based on Ti3C2Tx Mxene and the array of gold-silver core-shell nanocubes (MGS), that combines sensitivity and signal stability. The employment of MXene facilitates the non-selective capture and enrichment of exosomes. To overcome the issue of potentially overlooking spatial features in spectral data analysis, 1-D spectra were first transformed into 2-D images through GASF. By using transformed images as the input data, a deep learning model based on the MobileNet V2 framework extracted spectral features from higher dimensions, which identified different non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines with an overall accuracy of 95.23%. Moreover, the area under the curve (AUC) for each category exceeded 0.95, demonstrating the great potential of integrating label-free SERS with deep learning for precise lung cancer differential diagnosis.

Differences were also found between low and moderate, and moderate and high myopia samples, although fewer than between low and high myopia samples. The three-classification model, particularly with PLS-KNN training, exhibited superior discriminative performance with accuracy rates of 95%. Similarly, the two-classification model for low and high myopia achieved high accuracy with PLS-KNN (94.4%) compared to PCA-KNN (93.3%). PLS dimensionality reduction slightly outperformed PCA, enhancing classification accuracy. In addition, in both reduction methods, the KNN algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy and performance. The optimal PLS-KNN classification model showed AUC values of 0.99, 0.98, and 1.00 for ROC curves corresponding to low, moderate, and high myopia, respectively.

Integrating factors of local spread that impact disease-specific survival (DSS) in a modified classification to improve prognostication compared with the current staging. This was a retrospective analysis of 399 previously untreated oral tongue squamous carcinomas operated between 2016 and 2018. Factors related to the local extent of a primary tumor that impacted the DSS were studied. Multivariable analyses adjusted for pT, pN stage, and adjuvant therapy. Candidate staging systems were developed based on factors that significantly impacted DSS, and validated. Base tongue involvement (p = 0.021), DOI > 20 mm (p value = 0.040), and tumor crossing the midline (p value = 0.047) significantly impacted the DSS. The preferred model included base tongue involvement in T3 stage, and DOI > 20 mm and tumor crossing the midline into T4 stage (Model 2), which was superior to the current classification system in AIC (830.55 vs. 845.43), C-index (0.65 vs. 0.61), and visual inspection of Kaplan-Meier curves. Identifying and possibly including these clinical factors in addition to the current T-stage criteria could result in better prognostication of tongue cancers. Integration of proposed classification could improve the discrimination between stages.","2025","Head & neck"

However, limited evidence exists regarding its association with the severity of coronary artery disease (CAD), particularly in hypertensive patients with different glucose metabolic states, including those with H-type hypertension. This study aimed to investigate the relationship between TyG-BMI and CAD severity across different glucose metabolism conditions. This retrospective cohort study included 1537 hypertensive patients who underwent coronary angiography. The TyG-BMI was categorized into tertiles and analyzed using logistic regression models and restricted cubic spline (RCS) models to assess its association with multi-vessel CAD. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predictive value of TyG-BMI in detecting the severity of CAD in different glucose metabolism states, including normal glucose regulation (NGR), pre-diabetes mellitus (Pre-DM), and diabetes mellitus (DM). The above method has also been applied to populations of H-type hypertension patients. The TyG-BMI was significantly associated with the severity of multi-vessel CAD in hypertensive patients (Odds ratio [OR] 1.043, 95% CI 1.032-1.053). In the diabetic subgroup, after adjusting for risk factors, the risk of multi-vessel CAD in the T3 groups was 3.836-fold (95% CI 1.763-8.347; P = 0.001) higher than in the T1 group, with a non-linear dose-response relationship (P for non-linearity = 0.017). In H-type hypertension patients, the TyG-BMI was also significantly correlated with multi-vessel CAD (OR 5.248, 95% CI 1.821-15.126, P = 0.002) in the DM group. The ROC analysis revealed that TyG-BMI had the highest predictive value for multi-vessel CAD in diabetic patients, with an AUC of 0.720 (95% CI 0.661-0.780, P < 0.001). The TyG-BMI serves as a robust predictor of CAD severity in hypertensive patients, particularly those with diabetes and H-type hypertension. And the non-linear dose-response relationship between TyG-BMI and multi-vessel CAD in diabetic patients underscores its potential clinical utility. This index could serve as a valuable tool for the early identification of individuals at high risk.","2025","Diabetology & metabolic syndrome"

However, the factors contributing to clinical deterioration remain poorly understood. Patients with CVT from three centers between January 2017 and October 2023 were included and grouped as the development cohort and validation cohort. The danger triangle was defined as the posterior two-thirds of the superior sagittal sinus, confluence of sinuses, straight sinus, and deep venous system. The primary endpoint was clinical deterioration, characterized by new or progressive bleeding or infarctions or worsened neurological conditions post-admission. Using the results of multivariable logistic analysis, the Cerebral venOus thrombosis DEterioration (CODE) score was developed within the development cohort and validated within the validation cohort. The score' performance in predicting clinical deterioration was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The development cohort included 194 CVT patients (101 males, and the median age was 38 years). clinical deterioration occurred in 45 (23.2%) patients. Multivariate logistic analysis defined D-dimer > 1.5 mg/L, Glasgow coma scale ≤ 8, intracerebral hemorrhage, danger triangle as risk factors of clinical deterioration.

This retrospective multicenter study enrolled 279 patients from three centers, divided into a training set (n = 207) and an external test set (n = 72). The intra- and peritumoral radiomics analysis was employed to develop a combined radiomics model. A deep learning model was constructed based on the largest orthogonal slices of the tumor volume, and a clinical model was constructed using independent clinical predictors. The DLRN was then constructed by integrating deep learning, intra- and peritumoral radiomics, and clinical predictors. For comparison, an original radiomics model based solely on tumor volume (excluding the peritumoral area) was also constructed. All models were validated through 10-fold cross-validation and external testing, and their predictive performance was evaluated by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The DLRN demonstrated superior performance across the 10-fold cross-validation, with the highest AUC of 0.825±0.082. On the external test set, the DLRN significantly outperformed the clinical model and the original radiomics model (AUC = 0.819 vs. 0.708 and 0.670, P = 0.047 and 0.015, respectively). Furthermore, the combined radiomics model performed signiﬁcantly better than the original radiomics model (AUC = 0.778 vs. 0.670, P = 0.043).

Despite progress in identifying potential DDIs, a deep understanding of the underlying mechanisms of DDIs remains limited, constraining the rapid development and clinical application of new drugs. This study introduces a novel multimodal drug-drug interaction (MMDDI) model based on multi-source drug data and comprehensive feature fusion techniques, aiming to improve the accuracy and depth of DDI prediction. We utilized the real-world DrugBank dataset, which contains rich drug information. Our task was to predict multiple interaction events between drug pairs and analyze the underlying mechanisms of these interactions. The MMDDI model achieves precise predictions through four key stages: feature extraction, drug pairing strategy, fusion network, and multi-source feature integration. We employed advanced data fusion techniques and machine learning algorithms for multidimensional analysis of drug features and interaction events. The MMDDI model was comprehensively evaluated on three representative prediction tasks. Experimental results demonstrated that the MMDDI model outperforms existing technologies in terms of predictive accuracy, generalization ability, and interpretability. Specifically, the MMDDI model achieved an accuracy of 93% on the test set, and the area under the AUC-ROC curve reached 0.9505, showing excellent predictive performance. Furthermore, the model's interpretability analysis revealed the complex relationships between drug features and interaction mechanisms, providing new insights for clinical medication decisions. The MMDDI model not only improves the accuracy of DDI prediction but also provides significant scientific support for clinical medication safety and drug development by deeply analyzing the mechanisms of drug interactions. These findings have the potential to improve patient medication outcomes and contribute to the development of personalized medicine.","2025","Journal of biomedical informatics"

With emphasis on quality and value, it is essential that treatment recommendations are optimized. The purpose of the North American Spine Society (NASS) Appropriate Use Criteria (AUC) is to determine the appropriate (ie, reasonable) multidisciplinary treatment recommendations for patients with metastatic neoplastic vertebral fractures across a spectrum of more common clinical scenarios. A Modified Delphi process. Systematic Review OUTCOME MEASURES: Final rating for cervical fusion recommendation as either ""Appropriate,"" ""Uncertain,"" or ""Rarely Appropriate"" based on the median final rating among the raters. The methodology was based on the AUC development process established by the Research AND Development (RAND) Corporation. The topic of neoplastic vertebral fracture was selected by NASS for its Clinical Practice Guideline development (CPG). In conjunction, the AUC work group determined key modifiers and adopted the standard definitions developed by CPG, with minimal modifications. A literature search and evidence analysis performed by the CPG were reviewed by the AUC work group. A separate multidisciplinary rating group was assembled. Based on the literature, provider experience, and group discussion, each scenario was scored on a 9-point scale on 2 separate occasions, once without discussion and then a second time following discussion based on the initial responses. The median rating for each scenario was then used to determine if indications were rarely appropriate (1-3), uncertain / maybe appropriate (4-6), or appropriate (7-9). Consensus was not mandatory. Medical management was essentially always appropriate. Radiation therapy was appropriate 50% of the time and uncertain otherwise, and directly related to radiosensitivity of the tumor. Ablation was never rated appropriate with agreement, and about 50% of the time was rated as uncertain. For cement augmentation, the scenarios without stenosis or neurological changes, stable fractures with less than 80% height loss and intact posterior wall, and higher VAS pain scores accounted for 88% probability of an appropriate rating. Otherwise, cement augmentation was uncertain 68% of the time. Surgery was rated as appropriate with agreement in 35%, and uncertain or appropriate with disagreement in 59% of scenarios. The most important variables determining final rating for surgery (in order) were stability, spinal stenosis, and prognosis. Multidisciplinary appropriate treatment criteria were generated based on the RAND methodology. Recommendations were made for medical treatment, ablation, radiation, cement augmentation, and surgery based on 432 practical clinical scenarios.

This is important for the clinical applications of DL-based models to breast cancer screening, wherein a DL-based model is commonly developed in an institute and then tested in other institutes. One challenge of SSDG is to alleviate the domain shifts using only one domain dataset. The present study proposed a domain-invariant features learning framework (DIFLF) for single-source domain. Specifically, a style-augmentation module (SAM) and a content-style disentanglement module (CSDM) are proposed in DIFLF. SAM includes two different color jitter transforms, which transforms each mammogram in the source domain into two synthesized mammograms with new styles. Thus, it can greatly increase the feature diversity of the source domain, reducing the overfitting of the trained model. CSDM includes three feature disentanglement units, which extracts domain-invariant content (DIC) features by disentangling them from domain-specific style (DSS) features, reducing the influence of the domain shifts resulting from different feature distributions. Our code is available for open access on Github (https://github.com/85675/DIFLF). DIFLF is trained in a private dataset (PRI1), and tested first in another private dataset (PRI2) with similar feature distribution to PRI1 and then tested in two public datasets (INbreast and MIAS) with greatly different feature distributions from PRI1. As revealed by the experiment results, DIFLF presents excellent performance for classifying mammograms in the unseen target datasets of PRI2, INbreast, and MIAS. The accuracy and AUC of DIFLF are 0.917 and 0.928 in PRI2, 0.882 and 0.893 in INbreast, 0.767 and 0.710 in MIAS, respectively.

To address these challenges, we propose RetinaRegNet, a multi-stage image registration model with zero-shot generalizability across multiple retinal imaging modalities. RetinaRegNet begins by extracting image features using a pretrained latent diffusion model. Feature points are sampled from the fixed image using a combination of the SIFT algorithm and random sampling. For each sampled point, its corresponding point in the moving image is estimated by cosine similarities between diffusion feature vectors of that point and all pixels in the moving image. Outliers in point correspondences are detected by an inverse consistency constraint, ensuring consistency in both forward and backward directions. Outliers with large distances between true and estimated points are further removed by a transformation-based outlier detector. The resulting point correspondences are then used to estimate a geometric transformation between the two images. We use a two-stage registration framework for robust and accurate alignment: the first stage estimates a homography for global alignment, and the second stage estimates a third-order polynomial transformation to capture local deformations. We evaluated RetinaRegNet on three imaging modalities: color fundus, fluorescein angiography, and laser speckle flowgraphy. Across these datasets, it consistently outperformed state-of-the-art methods, achieving AUC scores of 0.901, 0.868, and 0.861, respectively.

Current models, primarily developed using regression analysis, can lead to inaccurate estimates when applied to external populations. This study evaluates the utility of cluster analysis as an alternative method for developing CVD risk stratification models, comparing its performance with established CVD risk prediction models. Using data from 3,416 individuals (mean age of 66 years and no prior CVD) followed for an average of 5.2 years for incidence of CVD, we developed a risk stratification model using cluster analysis based on established CVD risk factors. We compared our model to the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE2), the Pooled Cohort Equations (PCE) and the Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events (PREVENT) models. We used Poisson and Cox regression to compare CVD risk between risk categories in each model. Predictive accuracy of the models was evaluated using sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), and C-statistic. During the study, 161 CVD events were detected. The high-risk cluster had a sensitivity of 59.0%, a PPV of 7.5% a specificity of 64.2% and NPV of 96.9% to predict CVD. Compared to the high-risk groups of the SCORE2, PCE and PREVENT, the high-risk cluster had a high sensitivity and NPV, but a low specificity and PPV. No statistically significant differences were found in C-statistic between models. Cluster analysis performed comparably to existing models and identified a larger high-risk group that included more individuals who developed CVD, though with more false positives. Further studies in larger, diverse cohorts are needed to validate the clinical utility of cluster analysis in CVD risk stratification.","2025","European journal of preventive cardiology"

This study used machine learning (ML) algorithms with an aim to extract critical predictors and develop an ML model to predict PND among LT recipients. In this retrospective study, data from 958 patients who underwent LT between January 2015 and January 2020 were extracted from the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. Six ML algorithms were used to predict post-LT PND, and model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver operating curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1-scores. The best-performing model was additionally validated using a temporal external dataset including 309 LT cases from February 2020 to August 2022, and an independent external dataset extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care Ⅳ (MIMIC-Ⅳ) database including 325 patients. In the development cohort, 201 out of 751 (33.5%) patients were diagnosed with PND. The logistic regression model achieved the highest AUC (0.799) in the internal validation set, with comparable AUC in the temporal external (0.826) and MIMIC-Ⅳ validation sets (0.72). The top 3 features contributing to post-LT PND diagnosis were the preoperative overt hepatic encephalopathy, platelet level, and postoperative sequential organ failure assessment score, as revealed by the Shapley additive explanations method. A real-time logistic regression model-based online predictor of post-LT PND was developed, providing a highly interoperable tool for use across medical institutions to support early risk stratification and decision making for the LT recipients.","2025","Journal of medical Internet research"

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a novel pain assessment tool based on pulp symptoms. A preliminary list of items best-describing pulpitis was developed based on deductive and inductive approaches and the preliminary tool was piloted (n = 80). A final 11-item pain assessment tool was developed comprising 5 closed-ended items evaluating pain intensity to diverse stimuli (thermal and sweet) and 6 closed-ended items assessing various aspects of pulp pain (such as spontaneity, duration, referral, postural pain, pain upon biting and requirement for analgesics). The tool was tested on 300 adult patients (age range = 18-54 years) who presented with symptoms indicating some form of pulpitis. The 11 items were each scored from 1 to 4, yielding a total score between 11 and 44. These scores were subsequently compared to a set of diagnoses made utilizing established clinical reference standards, these include patient history, clinical examination, periapical radiographs, and pulp testing. All items in the tool reached an excellent content validity index score (≥0.83) for relevance. Following the pilot, six items were rephrased and five were removed. After final testing the constructed tool had a reliability coefficient of .8641, indicating a high level of internal consistency. Factor analysis extracted two factors that accounted for 59.61% of variance. The sensitivity and specificity was 95.36% and 86.58%, respectively. Likelihood ratio was 7.104 (LR+) and 0.05 (LR-) at cut-off point. The area under the ROC curve was 0.9714 with a SE of 0.0076. The cut off score by Youden index was 25 between reversible and irreversible pulpitis. The developed tool proved to be both valid and reliable. It is the first comprehensive multidimensional tool designed to standardize the pulp pain assessment protocol, covering various attributes of pulp pain and effectively distinguishing between reversible and irreversible pulpitis with a defined cut-off score. Furthermore, its use is anticipated to provide support in diagnosing ambiguous cases of inflamed pulp, which is especially helpful for less experienced dentists.","2025","International endodontic journal"

We aimed to establish a prognostic prediction model for patients with de novo metastatic breast invasive ductal carcinoma (dnMBIDC) based on machine learning algorithms and to investigate the value of primary site surgery. The data used in our study were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database (SEER, 2010-2021) and the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University (1st-NCUH, June 2013-June 2023). We used COX regression analysis to identify prognostic factors. We divided patients into training and validation groups and constructed Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) prognostic prediction model. In addition, we used propensity score matching (PSM), K-M survival analysis, and COX regression analysis to explore the survival benefit of patients undergoing primary lesion surgery. A total of 13,383 patients were enrolled, with 13,326 from SEER and 57 from 1st-NCUH. The results showed that XGboost had good predictive ability (training set C-index = 0.726, 1 year AUC = 0.788, 3 year AUC = 0.774, 5 year AUC = 0.774; validation set C-index = 0.723, 1 year AUC = 0.785.1, 3 year AUC = 0.770, 5 year AUC = 0.764), which has better predictive power than the Coxph model. We used Shiny-Web to make our model easily available. Furthermore, we found that surgery was associated with a better prognosis in dnMBIDC patients. Based on the XGboost, we can accurately predict the survival of dnMBIDC patients, which can provide a reference for clinicians to treat patients. In addition, surgery may bring survival benefits to dnMBIDC patients.","2025","Updates in surgery"

This is a cross-sectional study including 1025 healthy adults. Body composition was assessed by the BIA technique. The appendicular skeletal muscle mass index (ASMMI) and body fat percentage (BF%) were used for the screening of LMM and LMM-O. The raw BIA parameters were: resistance (R), reactance (Xc), phase angle (PhA), and impedance (Z). The vectors, R and Xc, were adjusted for height and projected on the RXc graph. Associations were checked by the correlation test, binary logistic regression, adjusted for age and body water, and ROC curve. LMM was found in 30.8% of the subjects, and 20.9 and 21.4% of the men and women were with LMM-O. PhA and R/H were the most powerful discriminators of LMM with a sensitivity of 62-100% and a specificity of 71-90%. Cutoff values of PhA ranged between 4.95° and 5.75° for women and men. The RXc graph was able to identify LMM subjects, with clustering on the right side: area of low cellularity, high R/H and low-phase angle. Traditional anthropometric indices were the least effective in identifying LMM-O. The BIVA approach, PhA, R and R/H are effective in the screening of LMM and LMM-O, irrespective of age, gender, intra- and extracellular hydration status.","2025","Internal and emergency medicine"

The traditional Kyoto gastritis scoring system, though effective, requires adaptation for non-invasive techniques like magnetic-controlled capsule endoscopy to enhance early diagnosis and improve patient comfort. This retrospective study involved 474 pediatric patients who underwent magnetic-controlled capsule endoscopy coupled with a 13C urea breath test at the Children's Hospital affiliated with Shanghai Jiao Tong University School of Medicine from January to December 2023. Utilizing the Kyoto gastritis scoring system, adapted for magnetic-controlled capsule endoscopy, we evaluated its effectiveness in diagnosing HP infection. To enhance diagnostic precision, a nomogram was developed that integrates these gastritis scores with demographic and clinical variables, providing a comprehensive tool for assessing the risk of HP infection. Our findings indicate that a Kyoto gastritis score of ≥ 2 has a high predictive accuracy for HP infection, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.755 (95% CI 0.697-0.813). The study highlighted Kyoto gastritis score and white mucous as significant predictors of infection, with odds ratios of 5.94 (95% CI 3.40-10.49) and 2.78 (95% CI 1.65-4.71), respectively. A predictive model incorporating these factors alongside demographic and clinical variables demonstrated robust diagnostic potential. The nomogram, incorporating these factors, showed robust diagnostic potential and improved the predictive accuracy. The adapted Kyoto gastritis scoring system for magnetic-controlled capsule endoscopy offers a promising approach for the early detection of HP infection in children. By integrating multiple diagnostic indicators from non-invasive magnetic-controlled capsule endoscopy, this model enhances early diagnostic accuracy and can significantly reduce discomfort and risks associated with traditional endoscopic procedures. • The 13C urea breath test is used to screen children for Helicobacter pylori infection.

This prospective study involved 115 patients with CHD, all aged 3 years or younger, who underwent CC, as well as 100 healthy age- and sex-matched controls. Baseline thyroid function tests (TFTs) were conducted for both the patients and controls. In the CHD cohort, TFTs were reassessed 4 weeks after the CC, and for those with abnormal TFT values at this time, the tests were repeated after 2 weeks. Levothyroxine was started for patients with persistent abnormal TFTs, at 4 weeks and 6 weeks assessments after CC. Four weeks after CC, 12% of the studied group exhibited hypothyroidism. Univariate analysis identified significant predictors of hypothyroidism following CC: aortic stenosis (RR = 10.0 (1.49-66.99), P = 0.018), duration of fluoroscopy during CC (RR = 2.12 (0.99-4.26), P = 0.05), and total iodinated contrast media (iCM) during CC (RR = 2.5 (1.35-3.55), P = 0.019). Multivariate analysis indicated that iCM dose was the sole significant predictor of developing hypothyroidism (RR = 2.10 (1.01-3.23), P = 0.04). ROC curve analysis showed that the cut-off point of iCM dose for prediction of hypothyroidism evolution is 8.7 gm/kg, (sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 65%), while the cut-off point of fluoroscopy duration which predicts the development of hypothyroidism is 24 min (sensitivity: 83%, specificity: 66%). Acquired hypothyroidism after CC persisted in 4% of this cohort for 6 months. Higher doses of iCM and longer duration of fluoroscope during CC are risk factors for the evolution of hypothyroidism post-CC. We recommend assessing thyroid profile 4 weeks after CC, particularly in patients who received an iCM dose greater than 8.7 gm/kg and/or exposed to fluoroscopy for more than 24 min. • The use of excess iodine leads to transient inhibition of thyroid hormones biosynthesis via the Wolff-Chaikoff effect. • Infants with congenital heart diseases (CHD) are more prone to hypothyroidism due to higher frequency of abnormal thyroid morphology and routine exposure to supraphysiological doses of iodine. • Exposure to a total dose of iodinated contrast media more than 8.7 gm/kg and a fluoroscopy duration more than 24 min during cardiac catheter are risk factors for the evolution of thyroid hypofunction following cardiac catheter.","2025","European journal of pediatrics"

Low prevalence predictors (LPPs) are frequently found in clinical data, yet few studies have explored their impact on model performance during variable selection. This study compared the Random Forest (RF) algorithm and stepwise regression (SWR) for variable selection using data from a paediatric sepsis screening tool, where 18 out of 32 predictors had a prevalence < 10%. Variable selection using RF was compared to forward and backward SWR. Model performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and the variables retained. Additionally, a simulation study assessed how increasing the prevalence of the predictors impacted the variable selection results. The best fitting RF and SWR models retained were 22, and 17 predictors, respectively, with 14 and 10 predictors having a prevalence < 10%. Both the RF and SWR models had similar predictive performance (RF: AUC [95% Confidence Interval] 0.79 [0.77, 0.81], LR: 0.80 [0.78, 0.82]). The simulation study revealed differences for both RF and SWR models in variable importance rankings and predictor selection with increasing prevalence thresholds, particularly for moderately and strongly associated predictors. The RF algorithm retained a number of very low prevalence predictors compared to SWR. However, the predictive performance of both models were comparable, demonstrating that when applied correctly and the number of candidate predictors is small, both methods are suitable for variable selection when using low prevalence predictors.","2025","Maternal and child health journal"

However, spatial variations among WSS have rarely been utilized to correlate with IAs' natural history. This study aims to establish the feasibility of using spatial patterns of WSS data to predict IAs' rupture status (i.e., ruptured versus unruptured). ""Patient-specific"" computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed for 112 IAs; each IA's rupture status was known from medical records. Recall that CFD-simulated hemodynamics data (wall shear stress and its derivatives) are located on unstructured meshes. Hence, we mapped WSS data from an unstructured grid onto a unit disk (i.e., a uniformly sampled polar coordinate system); data in a uniformly sampled polar system is equivalent to image data. Mapped WSS data (onto the unit disk) were readily available for Radiomics analysis to extract spatial patterns of WSS data. We named this innovative technology ""WSS-informatics"" (i.e., using informatics techniques to analyze WSS data); the usefulness of WSS-informatics was demonstrated during the predictive modeling of IAs' rupture status. None of the conventional WSS parameters correlated to IAs' rupture status. However, WSS-informatics metrics were discriminative (p-value < 0.05) to IAs' rupture status. Furthermore, predictive models with WSS-informatics features could significantly improve the prediction performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUROC]: 0.78 vs. 0.85; p-value < 0.01). The proposed innovations enabled the first study to use spatial patterns of WSS data to improve the predictive modeling of IAs' rupture status.","2025","Acta neurochirurgica"

We performed a therapeutic drug monitoring study of 100 PD patients using ropinirole or pramipexole extended release. Three blood samples were collected on the same day. Serum concentrations were measured, and 24 h area under the curve (AUC) calculated. The validated Questionnaire for Impulsive-Compulsive Disorders in Parkinson's Disease-Rating Scale (QUIP-RS) was used for assessing impulse control. Total ropinirole drug exposure showed weak, but significant correlation to the QUIP-RS score. No correlation between pramipexole serum concentrations and QUIP-RS was found. In ropinirole patients, both agonist dose and total dopaminergic treatment were correlated with QUIP-RS. Duration of ropinirole treatment correlated with impaired impulse control, and duration of dopaminergic treatment of any type correlated with QUIP-RS scores in both ropinirole and pramipexole patients. Our main finding is that impaired impulse control is correlated to both total drug exposure (AUC) and dopamine agonist dose for ropinirole, but not for pramipexole. These observations indicate that different strategies may be useful for treating PD patients with impaired impulse control: ropinirole dose reduction could be beneficial, whereas pramipexole treatment may have to be stopped.","2025","Journal of neurology"

We explore the diagnostic potential of automated linguistic analysis of natural spontaneous speech to differentiate MSA and PD. Spontaneous speech of 39 participants with MSA compared to 39 drug-naive PD and 39 healthy controls matched for age and sex was transcribed and linguistically annotated using automatic speech recognition and natural language processing. A quantitative analysis was performed using 6 lexical and syntactic and 2 acoustic features. Results were compared with human-controlled analysis to assess the robustness of the approach. Diagnostic accuracy was evaluated using sensitivity analysis. Despite similar disease duration, linguistic abnormalities were generally more severe in MSA than in PD, leading to high diagnostic accuracy with an area under the curve of 0.81. Compared to controls, MSA showed decreased grammatical component usage, more repetitive phrases, shorter sentences, reduced sentence development, slower articulation rate, and increased duration of pauses, whereas PD had only shorter sentences, reduced sentence development, and longer pauses. Only slower articulation rate was distinctive for MSA while unchanged for PD relative to controls. The highest correlation was found between bulbar/pseudobulbar clinical score and sentence length (r = -0.49, p = 0.002). Despite the relatively high severity of dysarthria in MSA, a strong agreement between manually and automatically computed results was achieved. Automated linguistic analysis may offer an objective, cost-effective, and widely applicable biomarker to differentiate synucleinopathies with similar clinical manifestations.","2025","Journal of neurology"

Cohort 1, comprising gold-standard consecutive CTA cases, was used in an MRMC study involving six board-certified general radiologists. Cohort 2, representing clinical CTA cases, was used to simulate a routine clinical setting. Following these evaluations, an algorithmic audit was conducted to identify any unusual or unexpected behaviors exhibited by the model. Cohort 1 consisted of 131 CTA cases, while Cohort 2 included 515 CTA cases. In the MRMC study, the AI-assisted strategy demonstrated a significant improvement in aneurysm diagnostic performance, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve increasing from 0.815 (95%CI: 0.754-0.875) to 0.875 (95%CI: 0.831-0.921; p = 0.008).

A pre-trained AI algorithm was used to select suspected PCa lesions and extract lesion features for model development. The study evaluated five prediction methods, including (1) A clinical-imaging model of clinical features and image features of suspected PCa lesions selected by AI algorithm, (2) the PIRADS category, (3) a conventional radiomics model, (4) a deep-learning bases radiomics model, and (5) biopsy pathology. In the externally validated dataset, the deep learning-based radiomics model showed the highest area under the curve (AUC 0.700 to 0.791). It exceeded the clinical-imaging model (AUC 0.597 to 0.718), conventional radiomic model (AUC 0.566 to 0.632), PIRADS score (AUC 0.554 to 0.613), and biopsy pathology (AUC 0.537 to 0.578). The AUC predicted by the model did not show a statistically significant difference among the three externally verified hospitals (p > 0.05). Deep-learning radiomics models utilizing AI-extracted image features from bpMRI images can potentially be used to predict PCa aggressiveness, demonstrating a generalized ability for external validation. Predicting the aggressiveness of prostate cancer (PCa) is important for formulating the best treatment plan for patients. The radiomic model based on deep learning is expected to provide an objective and non-invasive method for evaluating the aggressiveness of PCa.

Still, it remains unclear how BDNF relates to clinicoradiological characteristics particularly at the early stage of the disease where precise prognosis for the further MS course is crucial. BDNF, NfL and GFAP concentrations in serum and CSF were assessed in 106 treatment na﻿ïve patients with MS (pwMS) as well as 73 patients with other inflammatory/non-inflammatory neurological or somatoform disorders using a single molecule array HD-1 analyser. PwMS were evaluated for highly active profiles by applying the aggressive disease course criteria proposed by ECTRIMS. Serum/CSF values were logarithmically transformed and compared across groups using one-way ANOVA, while correlations were calculated using Pearson's correlations. ROC analysis and AUC comparisons for diagnostic performance of the three biomarkers were computed in an explorative analysis. Serum BDNF (sBDNF) concentrations were higher in treatment naïve pwMS with disease onset after the age of 40 years (p = 0.029), in pwMS with ≥2 gadolinium-enhancing lesions (p = 0.009) and with motor, cerebellar, cognitive or sphincter symptoms at onset (p = 0.036). BDNF correlated positively with NfL (r = 0.198, p = 0.014) and GFAP (r = 0.253, p = 0.002) in serum, but not in CSF. Neurological patients with an acute inflammatory relapse showed significantly higher sBDNF levels (p = 0.03) compared to somatoform controls, while patients without acute relapse did not differ from somatoform controls (p = 0.4). Better diagnostic performance was found for sBDNF than sNfL and sGFAP in differentiating between patients with vs. without 2 or more gadolinium-enhancing lesions (p < 0.05) and for sBDNF as compared to sNfL for separating patients with disease onset after vs. before age of 40 years. In pwMS, BDNF serum levels differ depending on disease-related characteristics, suggesting that not only inflammatory activity but also remyelination capacities may vary with disease severity. BDNF is increased when other biomarkers of neuroaxonal damage and neurodegeneration, such as NfL and GFAP, are elevated, possibly as a compensatory mechanism, and reflect possibly further pathophysiological aspects in MS beyond NfL and GFAP, probably including an apoptotic role for BDNF in neuroinflammation.","2025","Journal of neurology"

This pilot study aims to investigate the levels of these biomarkers in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of MS patients and explore their associations with clinical, cognitive, and optical coherence tomography (OCT) parameters. This cross-sectional pilot study included 26 patients with relapsing MS (RMS) and 13 symptomatic controls (SCs). Clinical, cognitive, and OCT assessments were performed, and CSF samples were analyzed for ferritin, neurogranin, TREM2, and neurofilaments. Neurogranin levels were significantly higher in RMS patients compared to SCs (p = 0.04), and the receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis indicated that neurogranin could be considered a disease biomarker (AUC = 0.733, p = 0.01). Ferritin and neurogranin showed a strong positive correlation (r = 0.690, p < 0.01), and both were inversely correlated with retinal ganglion cell layer (GCL) thickness. TREM2 was positively associated with baseline Expanded Disability Status Scale score. This pilot study suggests that neurogranin may be a potential biomarker at the time of MS diagnosis, and the interplay between ferritin, neurogranin, and TREM2 highlights the complex relationship between inflammation, oxidative stress, and neuronal damage in MS.

The L1-L3 vertebral bodies were manually annotated by experienced radiologists, and the HDLF was established to predict BMD and diagnose abnormality based on BPX images and clinical information. The performance metrics of the models were calculated and evaluated. The R2 values of the BMD prediction regression model in the independent test set based on BPX images and multimodal data (BPX images and clinical information) were 0.77 and 0.79, respectively. The Pearson correlation coefficients were 0.88 and 0.89, respectively, with P-values < 0.001. Bland-Altman analysis revealed no significant difference between the predictions of the models and QCT results. The classification model achieved the highest AUC of 0.97 based on multimodal data in the independent test set, with an accuracy of 0.93, sensitivity of 0.84, specificity of 0.96, and F1 score of 0.93. This study demonstrates that deep learning neural networks applied to BPX images can accurately predict BMD and perform classification diagnoses, which can reduce the radiation risk, economic consumption, and time consumption associated with specialized BMD measurement.","2025","Osteoporosis international : a journal established as result of cooperation between the European Foundation for Osteoporosis and the National Osteoporosis Foundation of the USA"

Stereotactic radiofrequency thermocoagulation (SRT) shows promise as a disconnecting intervention. Although magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is typically used to determine the attachment and intervention side, it presents challenges in cases of bilaterally attached HH, where the epileptogenic side is unclear. The lateralizing potential of electroclinical parameters in such cases remains uncertain. This retrospective study evaluates the lateralization value of specific parameters, particularly in patients with unilateral HH, to improve future diagnostics and treatment approaches for bilateral HH. Four lateralizing parameters-semiology, ictal electroencephalography (EEG), and interictal epileptiform discharges during awake (IEDsw) and sleep states (IEDss)-were assessed for correlation with HH attachment side using Spearman's ρ. We calculated areas under the curves (AUCs) and cutoffs for left and right IEDs prognostic lateralizing value, plotting differences between IEDsright and IEDsleft in a receiver-operating characteristic(ROC) curve to establish the required preponderance of unilateral IEDss to differentiate between left and right HHs. Binomial logistic regression was employed to predict the HH attachment side. We included 25 patients (2-55 years of age) with mainly unilateral (n = 22) HHs who underwent SRT and presurgical evaluation. All parameters correlated with HH attachment side (semiology R = -.62, p = .005; ictal EEG R = .51, p = .047; IEDs R = .55, p = .018; IEDw, R = .61, p = .018). AUC values for right and left IEDs were .76 (p = .047) and .85 (p = .019), respectively, with cutoffs of .34 and .15. The AUC for ""IEDsright-IEDsleft"" was .98 (p = .0018) with a cutoff of .16. IEDss and semiology were significant predictors, achieving 88% correct lateralization. IEDss are promising biomarkers for HH lateralization in unilateral HH. The predominance of unilateral IEDss suggests ipsilateral HH. Even in cases with predominantly bilateral IEDss, a slight preponderance of unilateral IEDss can indicate the attachment side. In addition, combining IEDss and semiology provides a predictive model for HH lateralization.","2025","Epilepsia"

Hypertension, in turn, can increase the risk of certain cancers. The coexistence of these diseases makes the use of combination drugs more common in clinical practice, but the potential interactions and regulatory mechanisms in these drug combinations are poorly understood. We used the humanized CYP2D6 mouse model to predict the effect of apatinib on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of metoprolol and investigated the interactional mechanism. The inhibitory effects and mechanisms of apatinib on metoprolol were investigated in vitro by using wild-type mouse liver microsomes (WT MLMs), humanized CYP2D6 mouse liver microsomes (hCYP2D6 MLMs), and human liver microsomes (HLMs). Molecular docking was utilized to explore the structural basis of the observed inhibitory mode. And in vivo interaction between apatinib and metoprolol was assessed by pharmacokinetics study using the humanized CYP2D6 mice. In vitro studies and molecular docking experiments indicated that apatinib competitively inhibited the metabolism of metoprolol. In vivo findings revealed that the administration of apatinib combined with metoprolol resulted in a significant increase in the AUC(0-t), AUC(0-∞) and Cmax of metoprolol; additionally, there was a reduction in the CLz/F and heart rate, indicating that apatinib strongly inhibited metoprolol metabolism. And the homologous CYP2D6 protein in WT mice was more sensitive to apatinib compared to the hCYP2D6 mice. Gender analysis revealed that metoprolol accumulation was more pronounced in male mice when combined with apatinib, indicating a higher susceptibility to cardiotoxicity in males.","2025","Chemical research in toxicology"

A case-control study was conducted to evaluate the risk factors associated with resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam. Patients with P. aeruginosa were defined as cases if they had ceftolozane/tazobactam-resistant strains, whereas those with ceftolozane/tazobactam-susceptible strains were defined as test-negative controls. A predictive scoring system based on binary logistic regression coefficients was formulated to predict resistance to ceftolozane/tazobactam. The score's performance was assessed using ROC curves and AUC. The sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of the score were determined on the basis of a cut-off point, using the Youden index. Ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance was detected in 18.4% of P. aeruginosa isolates from 473 patients. In multivariate analysis, a history of bronchoscopy [OR (95% CI) = 2.1 (1.1-4.3), P = 0.035], invasive mechanical ventilation [OR (95% CI) = 2.4 (1.2-4.5), P = 0.009], colistin/polymyxin B use [OR (95% CI) = 3.2 (1.8-5.7), P < 0.001] and fluoroquinolone use [OR (95% CI) = 2.3 (1.1-4.8), P = 0.024] in the preceding month prior to P. aeruginosa isolation were significantly associated with ceftolozane/tazobactam resistance. The AUC (95% CI) of the score was 0.734 (0.675-0.794), with a sensitivity of 69%, specificity of 71.8%, positive predictive value of 35.5% and negative predictive value of 91.1% at the cut-off point of 2, out of a range of 0-5.

The Exercise Adherence Rating Scale (EARS) has been adapted into several languages, but there is lack of a standardized tool for various Indian languages and cultural contexts, particularly for use with cancer survivors. With the anticipated 57.7% rise in cancer cases by 2040, this study aims to address this gap. To cross-culturally adapt EARS to Kannada (EARS-Kn) and evaluate its validity and reliability amongst HNC survivors enrolled in the Multimodal Oncology Rehabilitation Exercise-MORE© Program. Following Beaton guidelines, the EARS tool was adapted to Kannada. 34 HNC survivors engaged in the MORE© program. Internal consistency (Cronbach's ⍺) and construct validity (Exploratory Factor Analysis, EFA) were assessed. The Receiver Operating Curve (ROC) determined cut-off scores, sensitivity and specificity of the EARS-Kn. The EARS-Kn demonstrated a Cronbach's-⍺ value of .93. The EFA revealed a one-factor solution with eigenvalues exceeding one and 70.1% loading. The area under the curve (AUC) was 0.908. A cut-off score of 17 was established, with 95.83% sensitivity and 80% specificity. The EARS-Kn version showed strong validity and reliability among Kannada-speaking HNC survivors, indicating its potential to enhance the understanding of exercise adherence among them.

This prospective observational study enrolled patients from a single ED. We enrolled adult patients presenting to the ED with symptoms suggestive of infection and an initial quick sequential organ failure assessment score ≥2. Initial urine samples were collected, and urinary biomarkers (dickkopf-3, soluble triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells-1, kidney injury molecule-1, neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin (NGAL), and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-2 (TIMP-2), and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-7 (IGFBP-7), and TIMP-2 × IGFBP-7) were analyzed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay kit. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to evaluate biomarker performance. Of 84 patients, 63 (75.0 %) were diagnosed with AKI and 16 (19.0 %) died within 30 days. None of the urinary biomarkers demonstrated significant differences between the survivors and non-survivors. NGAL (p = 0.014) and TIMP-2 × IGFBP-7 (p = 0.027) levels were different between the AKI and non-AKI groups.

The training set data collected by Tianjin Chest Hospital on heart failure patients from December 2016 to December 2021, included 2056 samples and 97 medical characteristics. The minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance(mRMR) feature selection method was utilized to filter features that were strongly related to the patient's fluid volume status. Four machine learning classification models were used to predict patients' fluid volume status, and their effectiveness was measured using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC), calibration curve, accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, specificity, and sensitivity. Data from 186 heart failure patients collected between January 2022 and July 2022 were employed as an external validation set to investigate the effects of model training. SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) were used to interpret the ML models. Thirty features were selected for model development, and the area under the ROC curve AUC (95 % CI) for the four machine learning models in the testing set was 0.75 (0.73-0.77), 0.77 (0.74-0.79), 0.70 (0.67-0.73), and 0.76 (0.73-0.78), and the AUC (95 % CI) in the external validation set was 0.74 (0.71-0.76), 0.70 (0.67-0.73), 0.64 (0.59-0.68), and 0.67 (0.63-0.71).

However, they are not practically used for the differential diagnosis of the hyperbilirubinemia severity. Therefore, the current study aimed to assess the differential diagnostic value of peripheral blood biomarkers with disease severity as an alternative. A cross-sectional study was done on conveniently selected neonates admitted with hyperbilirubinemia during study period. A 4 ml of venous blood was collected for laboratory analysis. The Sysmex KX-21 cellular analysis and Mindray BS-240 automated chemistry analyzer was used for complete blood count and biochemical analysis, respectively. The data were entered into Epi-data (4.6.0) and analyzed by STATA (14) software. The summary statistics were used. The Kruskal Wallis H tests were utilized to compare median differences between groups. To ascertain the diagnostic value, receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed. Blood biomarkers score area under curve >.7 was selected as the best discriminative marker. The accepted threshold for statistical significance was set at P < 0.05. Current study found that red blood cell (RBC) and absolute lymphocyte count (ALC) can differentiate high-risk from low and intermediate-risk groups. Similarly, they can also stratify low-risk group from the intermediate and high-risk groups. Besides, mean cell volume (MCV), absolute neutrophil count (ANC), neutrophil to lymphocyte (NLR) and platelet to lymphocyte ratio (PLR), can exhibit significant discriminative ability to differentiate high-risk groups from intermediate and low-risk groups as well as low-risk groups from intermediate and high-risk groups. Furthermore, for hemolytic type of hyperbilirubinemia, RBC, Hb (hemoglobin), ALC, NLR, and PLR were found as good diagnostic markers to differentiate high risk group for others. Whereas, for non-hemolytic type of hyperbilirubinemia, MCV, ALC, MPV (mean platelet volume) and NLR were found as good discriminative marker of high-risk group form others. Peripheral blood biomarkers were found as acceptable to good early differential diagnostic marker with significant association to disease severity.

The purpose of this study was to compare the Ankle Ligament Reconstruction-Return to Sport After Injury (ALR-RSI), American Orthopaedic Foot and Ankle Society (AOFAS), and Karlsson scores in predicting 2-year RTS outcomes after arthroscopic treatment of CAI. It was hypothesized that ALR-RSI would be superior in predicting 2-year RTS outcomes after CAI surgery and that a quantifiable increase in this score would significantly improve RTS outcomes. Cohort study; Level of evidence, 2. This prospective cohort study analyzed patients who underwent surgery for CAI at a sports surgery center between 2016 and 2018. The inclusion criteria focused on adult patients undergoing their first surgery for CAI with a minimum 2-year follow-up. The primary outcome was RTS at 2 years. The study evaluated 3 scores at 1 year postoperatively to predict RTS at the same level as the preinjury level at 2 years-ALR-RSI, AOFAS Ankle-Hindfoot Scale, and Karlsson score. The most predictive score, with its corresponding optimal threshold, was determined using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. This threshold signifies the score value above which the likelihood of RTS at the preinjury level is significantly increased. Once identified, the secondary outcome evaluated the impact of a 10-point increase in this score on RTS, after adjusting for confounding factors. A total of 159 patients (age, 35.7 ± 11.4 years) were included. Two years after surgery, 40.25% of patients returned to their preinjury level of sports. ROC curve analysis of the tested scores at 1-year postoperatively showed the ALR-RSI score had the best predictive ability for RTS (area under the curve [AUC], 0.70 [95% CI, 0.6-0.77]), whereas Karlsson and AOFAS scores were less predictive (AUC, 0.53 [95% CI, 0.43-0.63] and 0.61 [95% CI, 0.52-0.70], respectively). The optimal threshold for the ALR-RSI score was identified at 83 (Youden index = 0.35, sensitivity = 63%, and specificity = 71%). Confounder identification revealed earlier surgery and arthroscopic techniques were associated with higher RTS rates. A 10-point increase in the ALR-RSI score correlated with increased odds of RTS (1.27 [95% CI, 1.12-1.46]; P = .0004) in univariate analysis and (1.29 [95% CI, 1.06- 1.61]; P = .01) in multivariate analysis. This study showed that none of the scores were great predictors of RTS after surgery for CAI. The ALR-RSI score was a stronger predictor of RTS to the same preinjury level after CAI surgery than AOFAS and Karlsson scores. The ALR-RSI optimal threshold identified was 83. A 10-point increase in the ALR-RSI score boosted the odds of RTS by 1.29 times.","2025","Orthopaedic journal of sports medicine"

Fecal, blood, and urine metabolomic analyses using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy were conducted. An integrative analysis of their associations with allergen-specific IgE levels in the context of allergic rhinitis and asthma were also assessed. The analysis of 228 various biofluid samples revealed strong positive correlations between stool and blood metabolites, while blood metabolites exhibited negative correlations with most urine metabolites. Five and 19 metabolites were significantly different in children with rhinitis and asthma, respectively (P < 0.05). Among them, blood isovaleric acid correlated positively with stool IgE levels in rhinitis, while stool butyric acid and acetic acid in asthma exhibited strong negative correlations with total serum and mite allergen-specific IgE levels (P < 0.01). Blood metabolic profiles appeared to have the highest area under the curve (AUC) of 0.732 for rhinitis, whereas stool metabolic profiles had the highest AUC of 0.799 for asthma.

The data were split into training and validation sets using the caret package in R. Decision Trees (DT), Extra Trees (ET), Ada Boost, Gradient Boosting (GB), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM), K Neighbours Classifier (KNN) and Random Forest (RF) algorithms were used for model construction. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, area under curve (AUC), accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, sensitivity and specificity were used to evaluate the performance of the model. Decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical utility of each model. Among the 400 subjects, 184 had thrombosis, with an incidence of 46%. Basic characteristics analysis and univariate analysis showed that there were significant differences in the history of radiotherapy or chemotherapy, age, mobility score, retention time, D-dimer, fibrinogen and urea (p < .05). Among the models constructed by the seven algorithms, the performance of DT model was relatively balanced. The AUC of the validation set was 0.782, the sensitivity was 0.618, and the specificity was 0.781. The predictive model for CRT developed using machine learning algorithms demonstrates good discrimination and clinical applicability among abdominal surgery patients, offering valuable guidance for CRT prevention strategies. By integrating risk prediction models into the Hospital Information System (HIS), nurses can assess catheter status in a timely and accurate manner, understand the risks of thrombosis for patients, and implement targeted preventive measures.

Here, we screened for DC-related genes to construct a prognostic signature to predict prognosis and response to immunotherapy in LUAD patients. DC-related biological functions and genes were identified using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) and bulk RNA sequencing. DCs-related gene signature (DCRGS) was constructed using integrated machine learning algorithms. Expression of key genes in clinical samples was examined by real-time q-PCR. Performance of the prognostic model, DCRGS, for the prognostic evaluation, was assessed using a multiple time-dependent receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, the R package, ""timeROC"", and validated using GEO datasets. Analysis of scRNA-seq data showed that there is a significant upregulation of LGALS9 expression in DCs isolated from malignant pleural effusion samples. Leveraging the Coxboost and random survival forest combination algorithm, we filtered out six DC-related genes on which a prognostic prediction model, DCRGS, was established. A high predictive capability nomogram was constructed by combining DCRGS with clinical features. We found that patients with a high-DCRGS score had immunosuppression, activated tumor-associated pathways, and elevated somatic mutational load and copy number variant load. In contrast, patients in the low-DCRGS subgroup were resistant to chemotherapy but sensitive to the CTLA-4 immune checkpoint inhibitor and targeted therapy. We have innovatively established a deep learning-based prediction model, DCRGS, for the prediction of the prognosis of patients with LUAD. The model possesses a strong prognostic prediction performance with high accuracy and sensitivity and could be clinically useful to guide the management of LUAD.

Forty severe TBI patients (Glasgow Coma Scale Score ≤ 8) were included. Ultrasonographic measurement of ONSD was performed and compared with intraparenchymal ICP monitoring to assess their association and determine the ONSD threshold value. Exclusion criteria included individuals under eighteen years old, penetrating TBI, or direct ocular trauma. Fifty-three ONSD measurements were conducted in all patients. The mean ONSD value in the group with intracranial pressure < 20 mmHg was 5.4 mm ± 1.0, while in the group with intracranial pressure ≥ 20 mmHg, it was 6.4 mm ± 0.7 (p = 0.0026).

A birth cohort study was conducted on pregnant women, who are biologically female, delivering at a tertiary hospital in Wuhan City between May 2023 and April 2024, encompassing 1620 participants. We collected maternal socio-demographic data through questionnaires and obtained information on fasting blood glucose (FPG), lipid levels during the third trimester, and neonatal physical development from medical records. This study aims to explore the correlation between pre-pregnancy BMI and offspring physical development by conducting statistical analyses and the mediating pathway of FPG levels and lipid levels during the third trimester. The final analysis included 1378 participants with complete records. After adjusting for potential confounders, the odds of giving birth to fetal macrosomia were significantly elevated in the overweight or obese pre-pregnancy BMI group (OR = 2.997, 95% CI 1.238-7.258). Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis showed that BMI, FPG, triglyceride (TG), and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) had the best-combined prediction effect on macrosomia, and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.833 (P < 0.05). Chain mediation analysis revealed that FPG and TG jointly mediated the associations between pre-pregnancy BMI and birth weight (BW), BMI, and head circumference, with mediated proportions of 1.96%, 1.84%, and 1.43%, respectively. Additionally, FPG and HDL-C jointly mediated the influence of maternal pre-pregnancy BMI on BW and BMI, with mediated proportions of 1.48% and 3.8%, respectively. The findings of the study indicate that pre-pregnancy BMI is associated with offspring's physical development at birth, with the overweight or obese pre-pregnancy BMI group having an increased risk of macrosomia. The most effective prediction for macrosomia comes from a combination of BMI, FPG, TG, and HDL-C levels. Moreover, the influence of pre-pregnancy BMI on offspring's physical development is partially mediated by FPG, TG, and HDL-C. • Previous research has established correlations between pre-pregnancy BMI and offspring's physical development. • Previous studies have demonstrated that late pregnancy blood lipid and glucose levels significantly predict fetal physical development. • The combination of pre-pregnancy BMI, FPG, TG, and HDL-C is the most effective predictor of macrosomia. • FPG, TG, and HDL-C jointly mediate the effect of pre-pregnancy BMI on physical growth.","2025","European journal of pediatrics"

Increased susceptibility to infection is a common manifestation of multiple myeloma (MM). Thus, we aimed to explore the clinical significance and possible mechanism of STING in MM. Immunohistochemistry and qPCR were used to detect STING expression in the bone marrow of MM patients, and flow cytometry was used to detect the amount of intracellular STING. All data were analyzed with clinical characteristics. STING expression was remarkably reduced in MM tissues compared to normal tissues and was not associated with stage. Multivariate analysis identified STING as an independent prognostic factor in MM patients (P = 0.001). In the bortezomib-containing regimens, patients with low STING expression were more difficult to achieve remission. A model incorporating STING and m-SMART significantly improved the predictive accuracy of overall survival in bortezomib regimens (AUC, 0.511 to 0.630, P = 0.044). Bortezomib efficacy has been reported to correlate with activated immunity, but the low expression group manifested as immune apathy. Although baseline characteristics showed intergroup differences in infection, the low expression group had an increased proportion of bacterial infections (1.7-fold) and a prolonged duration of antibiotic/antifungal medication (3.55 additional days); these patients were accompanied by a decreased neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) and rarely activated neutrophils and leukocytes. The intracellular STING ratio was also defective in neutrophil-dominated leukocytes. Our study revealed that STING had a strong association with bortezomib and could serve as a potential target for immunotherapy in multiple myeloma.","2025","Clinical and experimental medicine"

Whole-exome sequencing (WES) data from 80 lung cancer samples were utilized to simulate MPLC and IPM, with various sequenced panels constructed through gene subsampling. Two clonal interpretation approaches primarily applied in clinical practice, MoleA (based on shared mutation comparison) and MoleB (based on probability calculation), were subsequently evaluated. ROC analysis highlighted MoleB's superior performance, especially with the NCCNplus panel (AUC = 0.950 ± 0.002) and pancancer MoleA (AUC = 0.792 ± 0.004). In two independent cohorts (WES cohort, N = 42 and non-WES cohort, N = 94), NGS-based methodologies effectively stratified disease-free survival, with NCCNplus MoleB further predicting prognosis. Phylogenetic analysis further revealed evolutionary distinctions between MPLC and IPM, establishing an optimized NGS-based framework for differentiating multiple lung cancers.","2025","NPJ precision oncology"

Accurate preoperative prediction of PTLF is crucial for improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to develop and validate a prediction model based on the functional liver imaging score (FLIS) to assess the risk of PTLF. A total of 156 patients underwent Gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI within four weeks before TACE. Two radiologists, unaware of the clinical data, independently assessed FLIS on hepatobiliary phase images to quantitatively assess liver function. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses identified independent predictors of PTLF. A nomogram was developed and subjected to internal validation through bootstrap resampling of 1000 samples. The model's performance was conducted through the area under the curve (AUC), Hosmer-Lemeshow test, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA). P< 0.05 was considered statistically significant. PTLF occurred in 37.2% of patients (58/156). Significant differences were observed in factors such as portal vein thrombosis, albumin, aspartate transaminase, international normalized ratio (INR), model for end-stage liver disease scoring, albumin-bilirubin score, and FLIS. Multivariate analysis showed FLIS, portal vein thrombosis, and INR as independent predictors. The model achieved an AUC of 0.759, with 87.8% specificity and 56.9% sensitivity, and demonstrated good calibration (χ² = 7.101, P=0.526). Calibration curves and DCA confirmed its clinical utility.

The degree of pathological grade reflects the tumor heterogeneity of ESCC. The purpose is to develop and validate a nomogram based on enhanced CT multidimensional radiomics combined with inflammatory immune score (IIS) for predicting poorly differentiated ESCC. A total of 266 ESCC patients from the retrospective study were included and randomly divided into a training set (N=186) and a validation set (N=80), and a complete data set (N=266), and overall survival was determined to follow up after surgery. The tumor imaging was segmented to form intratumoral and peritumoral 3 mm areas of 3D volume of interest (VOI) on CT arterial and venous phases, and 3404 radiomics features were extracted. Finally, the radiomics scores were calculated for arterial phase intratumoral (aInRads), peritumoral 3 mm (aPeriRads3), and venous phase intratumoral (vInRads), peritumoral 3 mm (vPeriRads3). Logistic regression was used to fuse the four cohorts of scores to form a Stacking. Additionally, sixteen inflammatory-immune biomarkers were analyzed, including aspartate aminotransferase to lymphocyte ratio (ALRI), aspartate aminotransferase to alanine aminotransferase ratio (AAR), neutrophil times gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase to lymphocyte ratio (NγLR), and albumin plus 5 times lymphocyte sum (PNI), etc. Finally, IIS was constructed using ALRI, AAR, NγLR and PNI. Model performance was evaluated by area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analyse (DCA). Stacking and IIS were independent risk factors for predicting poorly differentiated ESCC (P<0.05). Ultimately, three models of the IIS, Stacking, and nomogram were developed. Compared with the Stacking and IIS models, nomogram achieved better diagnostic performance for predicting poorly differentiated ESCC in the training set (0.881vs 0.835 vs 0.750), validation set (0.808 vs 0.796 vs 0.595), and complete data set (0.857 vs 0.823 vs 0.703). The nomogram achieved an AUC of 0.881(95%CI 0.826-0.924) in the training set, and was well verified in the validation set (AUC: 0.808[95%CI 0.705-0.888]) and the complete data set (AUC: 0.857[95%CI 0.809-0.897]). Moreover, calibration curve and DCA showed that nomogram achieved good calibration and owned more clinical net benefits in the three cohorts. KaplanMeier survival curves indicated that nomogram achieved excellent stratification for ESCC grade status (P<0.0001). The nomogram that integrates preoperative inflammatory-immune biomarkers, intratumoral and peritumoral CT radiomics achieves a high and stable diagnostic performance for predicting poorly differentiated ESCC, and may be promising for individualized surgical selection and management.

This retrospective study aims to develop and validate a model that integrates deep learning and sub-regional radiomics from MRI imaging to predict pathological complete response (pCR) in patients with LARC. We retrospectively enrolled 768 eligible participants from three independent hospitals who had received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery. Pretreatment pelvic MRI scans (T2-weighted), were collected for annotation and feature extraction. The K-means approach was used to segment the tumor into sub-regions. Radiomics and deep learning features were extracted by the Pyradiomics and 3D ResNet50, respectively. The predictive models were developed using the radiomics, sub-regional radiomics, and deep learning features with the machine learning algorithm in training cohort, and then validated in the external tests. The models' performance was assessed using various metrics, including the area under the curve (AUC), decision curve analysis, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. We constructed a combined model, named SRADL, which includes deep learning with sub-regional radiomics signatures, enabling precise prediction of pCR in LARC patients. SRADL had satisfactory performance for the prediction of pCR in the training cohort (AUC 0.925 [95% CI 0.894 to 0.948]), and in test 1 (AUC 0.915 [95% CI 0.869 to 0.949]) and in test 2 (AUC 0.902 [95% CI 0.846 to 0.945]). By employing optimal threshold of 0.486, the predicted pCR group had longer survival compared to predicted non-pCR group across three cohorts. SRADL also outperformed other single-modality prediction models. The novel SRADL, which integrates deep learning with sub-regional signatures, showed high accuracy and robustness in predicting pCR to neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy using pretreatment MRI images, making it a promising tool for the personalized management of LARC.","2025","Academic radiology"

We comprehensively compare the diagnostic performance of amide proton transfer-weighted (APTw) MRI and its related metrics in glioma diagnosis, in the context of the latest classification. Totally 110 patients with adult-type diffuse gliomas underwent APTw imaging. The magnetization transfer ratio asymmetry (MTRasym), magnetization transfer ratio normalized by reference signal (MTRnormref), and spillover-corrected magnetization transfer ratio yielding Rex (MTRRex), and metrics based on Lorentzian fitting (Fit-amide, Fit-MTRnormref, and Fit-MTRRex) were calculated. Group differences were compared between IDH genotypes, and among three glioma subtypes. The diagnostic performances were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and compared. The correlations with Ki-67 expression were also analyzed. All APTw-related metrics exhibited significantly higher values in IDH-wildtype gliomas than in IDH-mutant gliomas (all p < 0.001). Fit-MTRnormref had the best area under the curve (AUC) of 0.858. All APTw-related metrics in glioblastomas were significantly higher than oligodendrogliomas (all p < 0.01) and astrocytomas (all p < 0.001). No metrics had significant difference between oligodendrogliomas and astrocytomas. The highest AUCs was 0.870 for Fit-MTRnormref in distinguishing astrocytomas from glioblastomas, and 0.867 for Fit-MTRRex in distinguishing oligodendrogliomas from glioblastomas. Besides, Fit-MTRnormref had the highest correlation coefficient with Ki-67 expression of 0.578. APTw-related metrics can effectively evaluate glioma IDH status, tumor subtypes and proliferation. The combination of Lorentzian fitting and the reference signal normalization could further improve the diagnostic performance, and perform better than MTRasym.","2025","Academic radiology"

The study analysed 22 indicators, including sociodemographic characteristics, behavioural factors, information related to T2DM, nutritional status, instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and depression. Independent risk factors related to cognitive frailty were identified using LASSO and multivariate logistic regression analysis. A prediction model was created using a nomogram. The calibration curve, decision curve analysis (DCA) and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to evaluate model performance. This study was reported using the STARD checklist (Data S1). The study found that cognitive frailty was prevalent in 30.7% of elderly patients with T2DM. Age, physical activity, glycosylated haemoglobin (HBA1c), duration of diabetes, nutritional status, IADL and depression were predictors of cognitive frailty. The ROC curve shows that the nomogram has good discriminative power. The calibration plots demonstrated a good fit between the observed and ideal curves. Additionally, DCA highlighted the clinical application of the nomogram. This study provided an effective and convenient approach to evaluating the risk of cognitive frailty among elderly T2DM patients, which can help in the clinical screening of high-risk individuals. Nurses should emphasise the care of comorbid cognitive frailty in elderly patients with T2DM.

NGAL levels were measured in supernatant from IC-stimulated neutrophils in the presence or absence of a toll-like receptor 8 inhibitor (TLR8i). In the exploratory cohort, serum levels of NGAL were increased in patients with SLE as compared with healthy controls (p=0.021), and associated with histological-proven membranoproliferative lupus nephritis (LN) (p=0.018). In the validation cohort, plasma levels of NGAL were elevated in patients with a history of LN (p=0.0048), as well as in patients with SLE with secondary antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) compared with those without (p=0.0022).

Existing weakly-supervised learning frameworks based on multi-instance learning have potential in WSIs analysis, but the large number of patches from WSIs challenges the effective extraction of key local patch and neighboring patch microenvironment info. Therefore, this paper aims to develop an automatic neural network that effectively extracts tumor microenvironment information from WSIs to predict molecular typing and prognosis of glioma. In this paper, we proposed a dual-path pathology analysis (DPPA) framework to enhance the analysis ability of WSIs for glioma diagnosis. Firstly, to mitigate the impact of redundant patches and enhance the integration of salient patch information within a multi-instance learning context, we propose a two-stage attention-based dynamic multi-instance learning network. In the network, two-stage attention and dynamic random sampling are designed to integrate diverse image patch information in pivotal regions adaptively. Secondly, to unearth the wealth of spatial context inherent in WSIs, we build a spatial relationship information quantification module. This module captures the spatial distribution of patches that encompass a variety of tissue structures, shedding light on the tumor microenvironment. A large number of experiments on three datasets, two in-house and one public, totaling 1,795 WSIs demonstrate the encouraging performance of the DPPA, with mean area under curves of 0.94, 0.85, and 0.88 in predicting Isocitrate Dehydrogenase 1, Telomerase Reverse Tranase, and 1p/19q respectively, and a mean C-index of 0.82 in prognosis prediction. The proposed model can also group tumors in existing tumor subgroups into good and bad prognoses, with P < 0.05 on the Log-rank test. The results of multi-center experiments demonstrate that the proposed DPPA surpasses the state-of-the-art models across multiple metrics. Through ablation experiments and survival analysis, the outstanding analytical ability of this model is further validated. Meanwhile, based on the work related to the interpretability of the model, the reliability and validity of the model have also been strongly confirmed.

Preliminary models were built using logistic regression, and the optimal one was selected as the radiomics signature. A nomogram was constructed by combining independent clinical factors and the radiomics signature. Its performance was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC) values of receiver operating characteristic curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and calibration curves. The radiomics signature comprised 14 absolute delta radiomics features. The nomogram, incorporating tumor thickness and radiomics signature, outperformed the other models (AUC = 0.79 and 0.78, training and test cohorts, respectively). The Delong test demonstrated that the nomogram's predictive performance was significantly higher than that of the clinical model (p < 0.05) in both cohorts.

Data of aneurysmal SAH patients treated by surgical clipping or endovascular coiling between 2003 and 2019 were obtained from the Japanese Stroke Databank (derivation cohort, n = 9,657) and ""Predict for Outcome Study of Aneurysmal Subarachnoid Hemorrhage"" (validation cohort, n = 5,085). Generalized additive models (GAMs) for poor outcome (modified Rankin Scale score ≥ 3 at discharge) were fitted with age transformation using spline curves for each World Federation of Neurological Societies grade. The discrimination property and calibration plot of unadjusted and adjusted models were assessed using the validation cohort. The derivation and validation cohorts included 3,610 and 3,251 patients, respectively. Regarding discrimination, areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for the derivation and validation cohorts were 0.835 and 0.827, respectively, in the unadjusted model and 0.844 and 0.836, respectively, in the adjusted model. An unbiased correlation was confirmed between predicted and observed probabilities of poor outcomes. GAM could help visualize the correlation between age and clinical outcomes. Our prediction model can quantitatively aid in treatment decision-making and can be effective for most diseases and treatment settings.

This study aims to establish a nomogram prediction model for preoperative prediction of the risk of GA patients. We retrospectively collected clinical data of GCP or GA patients who underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy (LC) between January 2020 and April 2023. We compared and analyzed the differences between the GCP group and the GA group. The data were divided into a training set and a validation set in a 7:3 ratio. Independent risk factors were determined using LASSO and Logistic regression analysis, and a nomogram model was established. The model was comprehensively validated and evaluated using the area under the ROC curve (AUC), Hosmer-Lemeshow test and clinical decision curve analysis (DCA). This study ultimately included 497 patients. The independent predictors of the nomogram model include blood type (O-type blood, OR 2.00, 95% CI 1.02-3.94; P = 0.046), number of lesions (solitary, OR 2.11; 95% CI 1.08-4.12; P = 0.033), sessile polyp (OR 2.04; 95% CI 1.06-3.92; P = 0.033), age (OR 1.10; 95% CI 1.07-1.20; P < 0.001), diameter (OR 1.30; 95% CI 1.17-1.45; P < 0.001). For the training and validation set, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.843 and 0.837, respectively, and the P-value for the Hosmer-Lemeshow test was 0.056 and 0.300, respectively. In addition, the calibration curve and DCA curve indicate that the model has accurate predictive ability and reliable clinical practicality. The blood type, number of lesions, sessile polyp, age and diameter are significant risk factors for GA. This nomogram model can use simple and readily available clinical data to predict the risk of having GA and can assist in guiding surgical decisions.","2025","Surgical endoscopy"

We aimed to develop a screening tool to better allocate resources by identifying individuals at higher risk for OSA, overcoming limitations of current tools that may under-diagnose based on self-reported symptoms. A total of 884 patients (490 diagnosed with OSA) were included, which was divided into the training, validation, and test sets. Using multivariate logistic regression analyses, we developed a scoring system incorporating male sex, age, sawtooth pattern, area under the inspiratory flow-volume curve (AreaFI), and neck circumference to objectively identify patients at higher risk of OSA. Sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) metrics. The M-APNE Score was compared to other non-symptom-based tools, the No-Apnea Score and the Symptomless Multivariable Apnea Prediction (sMVAP) model, using the Delong test. The M-APNE Score showed sensitivity rates of 79.3% in the training set, 70.8% in the test, and 80% in the validation set. ROC analysis for M-APNE score yielded AUCs of 0.82 in the training, 0.76 in the test, 0.82 in the validation set. The discriminative accuracy of M-APNE Score were found to be better than the No-Apnea Score (AUC = 0.82 vs. 0.76, p < 0.001) and the sMVAP (AUC = 0.82 vs. 0.75, p = 0.001) in the training set. Hosmer Lemeshow test indicated good calibration for M-Apne Score (p = 0.46). The M-APNE Score is a robust and objective tool for OSA screening, potentially reducing classification errors and improving accuracy.","2025","Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung"

Aim of this large retrospectively-validated study is to evaluate the predictive role of two-lesions radiomics in comparison with other clinical and conventional PET/CT models. cHL patients with bPET/CT between 2010 and 2020 were retrospectively included and randomized into training-validation sets. Target lesions were: Lesion_A, with largest axial diameter (Dmax); Lesion_B, with highest SUVmax. Total-metabolic-tumor-volume (TMTV) was calculated and 212 radiomic features were extracted. PET/CT features were harmonized using ComBat across two scanners. Outcomes were progression-free-survival (PFS) and Deauville Score at interim PET/CT (DS). For each outcome, three predictive models and their combinations were trained and validated: - radiomic model ""R""; - conventional PET/CT model ""P""; - clinical model ""C"". 197 patients were included (training = 118; validation = 79): 38/197 (19%) patients had adverse events and 42/193 (22%) had DS ≥ 4. In the training phase, only one radiomic feature was selected for PFS prediction in model ""R"" (Lesion_B F_cm.corr, C-index 66.9%). Best ""C"" model combined stage and IPS (C-index 74.8%), while optimal ""P"" model combined TMTV and Dmax (C-index 63.3%). After internal validation, ""C"", ""C + R"", ""R + P"" and ""C + R + P"" significantly predicted PFS. The best validated model was ""C + R"" (C-index 66.3%). No model was validated for DS prediction. In this large retrospectively-validated study, a combination of baseline 18F-FDG PET/CT two-lesions radiomics and other conventional models showed an added prognostic power in patients with cHL. As single models, conventional clinical parameters maintain their prognostic power, while radiomics or conventional PET/CT alone seem to be sub-optimal to predict survival.","2025","Annals of hematology"

A secondary analysis was performed using cross-sectional data from 1,264 nurses undergoing the menopause transition. The data set was randomly split into training (75%) and validation sets (25%), with the Bortua algorithm employed for feature selection. Seven machine learning models were constructed and optimized. Model performance was assessed using area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and F1 score. Shapley Additive Explanations analysis was used to elucidate the weights and characteristics of various factors associated with severe SCD. The average SCD score among nurses in the menopause transition was (5.38 ± 2.43). The Bortua algorithm identified 13 significant feature factors. Among the seven models, the support vector machine exhibited the best overall performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.846, accuracy of 0.789, sensitivity of 0.753, specificity of 0.802, and an F1 score of 0.658. The two variables most strongly associated with SCD were menopausal symptoms and the stage of menopause. The machine learning models effectively identify individuals with severe SCD and the related factors associated with severe SCD in nurses during the menopause transition. These findings offer valuable insights for the management of cognitive health in women undergoing the menopause transition.","2025","Menopause (New York, N.Y.)"

However, few studies focus on radiologic features for predicting ALI in patients with early-stage NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller. Purpose To identify radiologic features for predicting ALI in NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller in maximum diameter. Materials and Methods This study was a secondary review of pathologic and CT findings from an integrated health care system between January 2016 and November 2023 for participants in the prospective study Initiative for Early Lung Cancer Research on Treatment, or IELCART. Preoperative diagnostic radiologic features possibly related to ALI, volume doubling time (VDT), and PET maximum standardized uptake value were evaluated. Multivariable logistic regression analysis, adjusted for sex, age, nodule size, and smoking status, was used to determine predictors of ALI. Model performance was analyzed with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Of 778 resected NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller (median patient age, 69 years [IQR, 63-76 years]; 458 female patients), 715 (92%) were solid, 41 (5%) were part-solid, and 22 (3%) were nonsolid. ALI was documented in 271 (35%) resected NSCLCs, all in solid NSCLCs, representing 37.9% (95% CI: 34.4, 41.5) of solid NSCLCs. None of the 63 subsolid NSCLCs had ALI (0% [95% CI: 0, 5.75]). For the 715 solid NSCLCs (median patient age, 69 years [IQR, 63-76 years]; 420 female patients), multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that lollipop sign (odds ratio [OR] = 4.12 [95% CI: 2.82, 6.04]; P < .001) and spiculation (OR = 2.05 [95% CI: 1.42, 2.97]; P < .001) were independent predictors of ALI (AUC = 0.77 [95% CI: 0.73, 0.80]). Considering only the 474 patients in whom VDT could be calculated based on CT scans, VDT was also an independent predictor for ALI (OR = 0.96 [95% CI: 0.94, 0.98]; P < .001). Incorporating VDT into the model improved ALI prediction (AUC = 0.82 [95% CI: 0.77, 0.86]; P < .001). Conclusion For patients with NSCLCs 30 mm or smaller, ALI was present in 37.9% of solid NSCLCs and none of the 63 subsolid NSCLCs. Among solid NSCLCs, lollipop sign, spiculation, and VDT were independent radiologic predictors of ALI. © RSNA, 2025 Supplemental material is available for this article.

Machine learning (ML) methods can help address this complexity by incorporating a broader spectrum of variables. Purpose To investigate the performance of an ML model that uses both stress cardiac MRI and coronary CT angiography (CCTA) data to predict major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE) in patients with newly diagnosed CAD. Materials and Methods This retrospective study included consecutive symptomatic patients without known CAD referred for CCTA between December 2008 and January 2020. Patients with obstructive CAD (at least one ≥50% stenosis at CCTA) underwent stress cardiac MRI for functional assessment. Eighteen clinical, two electrocardiogram, nine CCTA, and 12 cardiac MRI parameters were evaluated as inputs for the ML model, which involved automated feature selection with the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm and model building with an XGBoost algorithm. The primary outcome was MACE, defined as a composite of cardiovascular death and nonfatal myocardial infarction. External testing was performed using two independent datasets. Performance was compared between the ML model and existing scores and other approaches using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Results Of 2210 patients who completed cardiac MRI, 2038 (mean age, 70 years ± 12 [SD]; 1091 [53.5%] female participants) completed follow-up (median duration, 7 years [IQR, 6-9 years]); 281 experienced MACE (13.8%). The ML model exhibited a higher AUC (0.86) for MACE prediction than the European Society of Cardiology score (0.55), QRISK3 score (0.60), Framingham Risk Score (0.50), segment involvement score (0.71), CCTA data alone (0.76), or stress cardiac MRI data alone (0.83) (P value range, <.001 to .004).

We analyzed data from patients with carbon monoxide poisoning, which were divided into training and test sets. We developed and evaluated sixteen machine learning models, using accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and other relevant metrics. Threshold adjustments were performed to determine the most accurate model for predicting patients with carbon monoxide poisoning at risk of delayed neurological sequelae. A total of 360 patients with carbon monoxide poisoning were investigated in the present study, of whom 103 (28.6%) were diagnosed with delayed neurological sequelae, and two (0.6%) died. After threshold adjustment, the synthetic minority oversampling technique-random forest model demonstrated superior performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.89 and an accuracy of 0.83. The sensitivity and specificity of the model were 0.9 and 0.8, respectively.

It is unknown if thickness and volumetric changes can identify AD stages and if they are similar to other genetic forms of AD. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were collected for 178 DS adults (106 nonclinical, 45 preclinical, and 27 symptomatic). Cortical thickness and subcortical volumes were compared between DS groups and evaluated as a staging metric using receiver operating characteristic analyses. Thickness patterns were compared to those previously reported in autosomal-dominant AD (ADAD). Decreased parietal and temporal lobe thickness differentiated amyloid positivity (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.83) and impairment (AUC = 0.81), and slightly outperformed subcortical volumes (AUC = 0.8/0.74). Thickness differences in DS were more widespread, severe, and had better discriminative ability than ADAD. Cortical thickness can stage AD pathology in DS. Identification of brain regions affected by AD may aid in tracking disease course and evaluating treatment effects. DSAD is associated with reduced temporal and parietal cortical thickness. DSAD is associated with smaller hippocampal and striatal volumes. Thickness differences can stage DSAD better than other forms of AD. DSAD thickness differences are more extensive and severe than ADAD.","2025","Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association"

Due to the lack of symptoms until advanced stages, early diagnosis of ccRCC is challenging. Therefore, the identification of novel secreted biomarkers for the early detection of ccRCC is urgently needed. This study aimed to identify novel secreted biomarkers for diagnosing ccRCC using bioinformatics and machine learning techniques based on transcriptomics data. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in ccRCC compared to normal kidney tissues were identified using 3 transcriptomics datasets (GSE53757, GSE40435 and GSE11151) from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). Potential secreted biomarkers were examined within these common DEGs using a list of human secretome proteins from The Human Protein Atlas. The recursive feature elimination (RFE) technique was used to determine the optimal number of features for building classification machine learning models. The expression levels and clinical associations of candidate biomarkers identified with RFE were validated using transcriptomics data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Classification models were then developed based on the expression levels of these candidate biomarkers. The performance of the models was evaluated based on accuracy, evaluation metrics, confusion matrices, and ROC-AUC (receiver operating characteristic-area under the ROC curve) curves. We identified 44 DEGs that encode potential secreted proteins from 274 common DEGs found across all datasets. Among these, insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP3) and lectin, galactoside-binding, soluble, 1 (LGALS1) were selected for further analysis using the RFE technique. Both IGFBP3 and LGALS1 showed significant upregulation in ccRCC tissues compared to normal tissues in the GEO and TCGA datasets. The results of the survival analysis indicated that patients with higher expression levels of these genes exhibited shorter overall and disease-free survival times (OS and DFS). Decision tree and random forest models based on IGFBP3 and LGALS1 levels achieved an accuracy of 98.04% and an AUC of 0.98.

RD leads to an increased risk of poor outcomes such as the need for dialysis. Albuminuria is a known kidney damage biomarker for DKD, yet RD cases do not always show changes in albuminuria, and the exact mechanism of RD remains unclear. Previous studies focused on a limited number of laboratory tests, no comprehensive study targeting a wide range of laboratory tests has been done. We target to develop a model that predicts RD among T2D and points to key laboratory tests of interest in understanding RD from various laboratory tests. Our machine learning model predicts whether RD, as represented via eGFR, will happen within 1 year. Additionally, the model uses Recursive feature elimination with cross-validation (RFECV) to eliminate the features that do not contribute to the prediction. We trained and assessed the model using 1202 types of laboratory tests from 3438 diabetes patients at the University of Tokyo Hospital. The means (95 % confidence interval) of the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (ROC-AUC), precision-recall area under the curve, accuracy rate, and F1-score of an 8-feature-model were 0.820 (0.811, 0.829), 0.430 (0.410, 0.451), 0.754 (0.747, 0.761), and 0.500 (0.485, 0.515), respectively. The RFECV revealed that 7 test types (MCH, γ-GTP, Cre, HbA1c, HDL-C, eGFR, and Hct) contributed to RD prediction. The model's ROC-AUC of 0.820 improves on the ROC-AUC of 0.775 seen in previous studies. The proposed model accurately predicts RD among diabetes patients and helps physicians focus on inhibiting progression of kidney damage.

Three-hundred and one participants who had glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) data at baseline and after intervention were included for this post hoc analysis. We used the multi-way analysis of variance to assess the differences between the diabetes remission and non-remission groups or between intervention groups in changes of the indexes of insulin sensitivity, insulin secretion, and beta cell function. Furthermore, logistic regression analysis was used to identify the association between the diabetes remission and baseline and change of each insulin index. Participants with a higher disposition index (DI) or higher adaptation index at baseline were more likely to achieve diabetes remission. The diabetes remission group had a significantly greater increase in AUCc-pep0-30/AUCgluc0-30, DI, and adaptation index compared with the non-remission group, while there were no between-group differences in indexes of insulin sensitivity. Participants with greater increases in insulin secretion and beta cell function were more likely to achieve diabetes remission. Indexes of beta cell function improved in all intervention groups, while the diet intervention induced significant improvement compared with lifestyle education. These findings supported the importance of aggressively implementing intensive lifestyle interventions for individuals with type 2 diabetes at an early stage of the disease, when beta cell function was not yet significantly impaired, to promote achieving diabetes remission.","2025","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism"

Although the prediction of individualized readmission risk may inform appropriate preoperative interventions, current predictive models, such as the American College of Surgeons National Surgical Quality Improvement Program (ACS-NSQIP) surgical risk calculator (SRC), have limited utility. This study aims to compare the predictive accuracy of the SRC with a novel artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm for 30-day readmission after primary TKA, using the same set of clinical variables from a large national database. Patients undergoing primary TKA between 2013 and 2020 were identified from the ACS-NSQIP database and randomly stratified into training and validation cohorts. The ANN was developed using data from the training cohort with fivefold cross-validation performed five times. ANN and SRC performance were subsequently evaluated in the distinct validation cohort, and predictive performance was compared on the basis of discrimination, calibration, accuracy, and clinical utility. The overall cohort consisted of 365,394 patients (trainingN = 362,559; validationN = 2835), with 11,392 (3.1%) readmitted within 30 days. While the ANN demonstrated good discrimination and calibration (area under the curve (AUC)ANN = 0.72, slope = 1.32, intercept = -0.09) in the validation cohort, the SRC demonstrated poor discrimination (AUCSRC = 0.55) and underestimated readmission risk (slope = -0.21, intercept = 0.04). Although both models possessed similar accuracy (Brier score: ANN = 0.03; SRC = 0.02), only the ANN demonstrated a higher net benefit than intervening in all or no patients on the decision curve analysis. The strongest predictors of readmission were body mass index (> 33.5 kg/m2), age (> 69 years), and male sex. This study demonstrates the superior predictive ability and potential clinical utility of the ANN over the conventional SRC when constrained to the same variables. By identifying the most important predictors of readmission following TKA, our findings may assist in the development of novel clinical decision support tools, potentially improving preoperative counseling and postoperative monitoring practices in at-risk patients.","2025","Knee surgery & related research"

While the role of Wnt/β-catenin signaling in this disorder has been verified, the impact of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) associated with this pathway has not been studied in schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to examine the expression levels of Wnt/β-catenin-related lncRNAs, namely CCAT2, SNHG5, PTCSC3, and DANCR, as well as the CTNNB1 gene encoding beta-catenin protein in two groups of schizophrenia patients (drug-naïve and medicated) compared with healthy individuals. This study included 50 medicated patients in the remission phase of the disease, 25 drug-naive patients in the acute phase, and 50 control subjects. There was no significant difference in CTNNB1 gene expression in the medicated patients compared to controls (P value = 0.9754). However, the expression of this gene was significantly decreased in drug-naïve first-episode patients compared with controls (P value < 0.001). In contrast, expression of DANCR, PTCSC3, SNHG5, and CCAT2 genes was significantly higher in medicated (P values < 0.001, < 0.001, = 0.01, < 0.001, respectively) and drug-naive first-episode patients (P value < 0.001) compared to control subjects. ROC curve analysis revealed that DANCR, PTCSC3, SNHG5, and CCAT2 genes had diagnostic power with specificity and sensitivity of 80% and above in separation between study subgroups.

We aimed to investigate the potential predicting factors among individualized basic parameters that affect poor or hyper ovarian responses in PCOS patients. We retrospectively screened 2058 women with PCOS who underwent their first cycle of in vitro fertilization/intracytoplasmic sperm injection. Spearman correlation analysis and multivariable linear regression model were applied to screen potential variables impacting the number of oocyte retrieved. Further, women with PCOS were divided into poor, sub-optimal, optimal, and hyper responders based on oocyte-retrieved numbers. Logistic regression model and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve were used to testify the predicting effect of screened parameters on ovarian response. Multivariable linear regression showed that body mass index (BMI) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) were significantly negatively correlated with oocyte numbers, while luteinizing hormone and anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) showed a positive correlation. Logistic regression model showed that high BMI (RR: 1.141, 95% CI: 1.090, 1.195) and FSH (RR: 1.161, 95% CI: 1.043, 1.293) were risk factors for poor and sub-optimal ovarian response, but not for hyper response. High AMH level was a risk factor (RR: 1.118, 95% CI: 1.075, 1.163) for hyper ovarian response. The optimal cutoff value was BMI = 23.25 kg/cm2, FSH = 6.375 IU/L, and AMH = 9.8 ng/mL, respectively. Individualized basic parameters including BMI, FSH, and AMH are crucial for predicting ovarian response of women with PCOS, providing valuable information for formulating personalized diagnosis and treatment plans.","2025","Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics"

We previously demonstrated that the response to oxytocin is more robust in the uteri of proven breeder rats. This study investigates the contribution of T-type calcium channels (TTCCs) and L-type calcium channels (LTCCs) to the distinct response of virgin (V) and proven breeder (PB) rat uteri to oxytocin. Dose-inhibition responses to mibefradil (TTCC inhibitor) and verapamil (LTCC inhibitor) were conducted on isolated V and PB uterine strips. These experiments were followed by dose-response curves to oxytocin (10-10 to 10-5 M) in the presence of 10 µM of each inhibitor. Area-under-the-curve (AUC), amplitude, frequency, and duration of contractions were measured. V uteri generally showed a greater dependence on VGCCs, especially TTCCs. However, PB uteri exhibited a stronger frequency response to oxytocin. Blocking TTCCs had a more pronounced impact on the differential oxytocin response, particularly affecting the frequency component of contractions. The stronger frequency response in PB uteri may be due to a higher concentration of TTCCs in their myometrial pacemaker cells. This study provides supporting evidence that pregnancy induces lasting changes in uterine calcium handling. Our findings suggest that TTCCs play a more important role than LTCC in the parity-dependent differential response to oxytocin. The impact of ORAI and TRP channels still needs to be evaluated, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the relative impact of voltage-gated calcium channels vs. storage-operated calcium entry channels on this phenomenon.","2025","Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)"

The following indicators were compared between the two groups of patients: gender, age, Glasgow Coma Scale(GCS)score, whether the amount of bleeding was greater than 30 ml, whether it broke into the ventricle or not, modified Graeb score(MGS), modified Rankin Scale (MRS) score, whether surgery was performed or not, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. After variable screening, the following six variables were selected: GCS score, MGS, MRS score, whether the bleeding volume was greater than 30 ml, whether it broke into the ventricle or not, and whether surgery was performed or not were modelled and analysed using logistic regression model and support vector machine model in machine learning. The results showed that under the same conditions, the accuracy of the support vector machine model was 0.89 and F1 was 0.838 ,the value of the AUC of the support vector machine model is 0.888; the accuracy of the logistic regression model was 0.902 and F1 was 0.89, the value of the AUC of the support vector machine model is 0.903. Compared with the group without hydrocephalus, patients in the group with hydrocephalus had bleeding volume greater than 30 ml, haemorrhage into the ventricles of the brain, and had undergone surgery in the brain, and the difference was statistically significant (P 0.001). Statistical analysis showed that GCS score ≤ 8.8, modified Graeb score (MGS) ≥ 10 and MRS score ≥ 3 were independent risk factors for the development of hydrocephalus after spontaneous ventricular haemorrhage. Therefore, patients with lower GCS score, higher modified Graeb score, higher MRS score, bleeding volume > 30 ml, haemorrhage into the ventricles of the brain, and experience of having undergone surgery in the brain should be operated on early to remove the intraventricular haematoma in order to reduce the incidence of hydrocephalus.","2025","Neuroinformatics"

The clinical data of the patients were collected, the occurrence of hydrocephalus within 3 months after discharge was followed up, and the patients were divided into the occurrence group and the non-occurrence group. Logistic regression analysis was applied to identify risk factors for hydrocephalus, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the predictive value of these factors. Among 500 patients, 45 (9%) developed hydrocephalus, with an average age of 59.93 ± 14.20 years in the occurrence group and 61.76 ± 12.28 years in the non-occurrence group. Logistics univariate analysis showed that the brain haemorrhage location, cerebral hernia, haematoma volume and the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score were the influencing factors for hydrocephalus after HICH (P < 0.05). The results of logistics multivariate analysis showed that cerebral hernia (odds ratio [OR] = 3.102, 95% CI: 1.315-7.204) and the GCS score (OR = 1.732. 95% CI: 1.102-2.401) were risk factors for the development of hydrocephalus after HICH (P < 0.05). The ROC curve analysis showed an area under the curve of 0.639 for cerebral hernia, 0.713 for the GCS score and 0.794 for their combination in predicting hydrocephalus. Cerebral hernia and the GCS score are independent influencing factors of hydrocephalus after HICH, and the combination of the two can better predict the formation of hydrocephalus.","2025","Neurosurgical review"

We aimed to investigate whether adding measures of anxiety and depression to the American Heart Association Predicting Risk of Cardiovascular Disease Events (PREVENT) predictors improves the prediction of CVD risk. We developed and internally validated risk prediction models using 60% and 40% of the cohort data from the UK Biobank, respectively. Mental health predictors included baseline depressive symptom score and self-reported and record-based history of anxiety and depression diagnoses before the baseline. We identified CVD events using hospital admission and death certificate data over a 10-year period from baseline. We determined incremental predictive values by adding the mental health predictors to the PREVENT predictors using Harrell's C-indices, sensitivity, specificity, and net reclassification improvement indices. We used a threshold of 10-year risk of incident CVD of greater than 5%. Of the 502 366 UK Biobank participants, we included 195 489 in the derivation set and 130 326 in the validation set. In the validation set, the inclusion of all mental health measures, except self-reported anxiety, produced a very modest increase in the C-index and specificity while sensitivity remained unchanged. Among these mental health predictors, depressive symptom score produced the greatest improvements in both C-index (difference of 0.005, 95% confidence interval 0.004-0.006) and specificity (difference of 0.89%). Depressive symptom score showed similar small improvements in female and male validation sets. Our findings suggest that the inclusion of measures of depression and anxiety in PREVENT would have little additional effect on the risk classification of CVD at the population level and may not be worthwhile.","2025","CMAJ : Canadian Medical Association journal = journal de l'Association medicale canadienne"

We used Cox regression analysis, adjusted for traditional risk factors, to examine the associations, with false discovery rate adjustment for multiple comparisons. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to assess their predictive values. During a median follow-up of 12.5 years, 749 incident strokes occurred among 45 161 participants. The analysis identified 29 significant parameters associated with stroke risk, with a notable dominance of density parameters (over half). Each SD change in these parameters increased stroke risk by 9.8% to 19.0%. For identified calibre parameters, each SD change was associated with an increased risk (ranging from 10.1% to 14.1%). For identified complexity parameters and arterial inflection count tortuosity, each SD decrease was linked to an increased risk (ranging from 10.4% to 19.5%). The introduction of retinal vascular parameters improved the area under the ROC curve to 0.752, significantly outperforming the model using only traditional risk factors (0.739, p<0.001).

We analyzed data from the 2011 China Health and Nutrition Survey cohort of individuals who were not hypertensive at baseline and had follow-up results available for prediction by 2015. We tested and evaluated the performance of four traditional machine learning algorithms commonly used in epidemiological studies: Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, XGBoost, LightGBM, and two deep learning algorithms: TabNet and AMFormer model. We modeled using 16 and 29 features, respectively. SHAP values were applied to select key features associated with new onset hypertension. A total of 4,982 participants were included in the analysis, of whom 1,017 developed hypertension during the 4-year follow-up. Among the 16-feature models, Logistic Regression had the highest AUC of 0.784(0.775∼0.806). In the 29-feature prediction models, AMFormer performed the best with an AUC of 0.802(0.795∼0.820), and also scored the highest in MCC (0.417, 95%CI: 0.400∼0.434) and F1 (0.503, 95%CI: 0.484∼0.505) metrics, demonstrating superior overall performance compared to the other models. Additionally, key features selected based on the AMFormer, such as age, province, waist circumference, urban or rural location, education level, employment status, weight, WHR, and BMI, played significant roles. We used the AMFormer model for the first time in predicting new onset hypertension and achieved the best results among the six algorithms tested.

This study investigated the association between the ratio of skeletal muscle mass to visceral fat area (SVR) and left ventricular diastolic dysfunction (LVDD) in patients with preserved ejection fraction using random forest machine learning. In total, 1,070 participants with preserved left ventricular ejection fraction who underwent comprehensive health examinations, including transthoracic echocardiography and bioimpedance body composition analysis, were enrolled. SVR was calculated as an index of sarcopenic obesity by dividing the appendicular skeletal muscle mass by the visceral fat area. In the random forest model, age and SVR were the most powerful predictors of LVDD. Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that older age (adjusted odds ratio [OR], 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.07 to 1.15) and lower SVR (adjusted OR, 0.08; 95% CI, 0.01 to 0.57) were independent risk factors for LVDD. SVR showed a significant improvement in predictive performance and fair predictability for LVDD, with the highest area under the curve noted in both men and women, with statistical significance. In non-obese and metabolically healthy individuals, the lowest SVR tertile was associated with a greater risk of LVDD compared to the highest SVR tertile.

We conducted a prospective study involving 100 patients undergoing isolated CABG from April 2023 to April 2024. Key parameters measured included LA strain measurements, Left Atrial Emptying Fraction (LA-EF), Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction, Left Atrial Volume index (LAVi). POAF occurred in 27 patients (27 %) with a mean latency of 3.2 ± 2.1 days. Higher preoperative serum creatinine levels were significantly associated with POAF. LA strain parameters (LA Reservoir Strain, LA Contraction Strain) and LA-EF were all significantly lower in the POAF group. Multivariate logistic regression identified LA Contraction Strain (OR: 0.73, p = 0.04), LA Reservoir Strain (OR: 0.27, p = 0.02) and preoperative serum creatinine (OR: 0.55, p = 0.01) as significant predictors of POAF.

We analysed 1352 participants aged 60-79 from the 2011-2014 NHANES dataset, who underwent cognitive function testing, depression assessments, and TyG index measurements. Multivariate linear regression and subgroup analyses were conducted to examine associations between the TyG index and depression/cognitive impairment. Machine learning models evaluated the importance of predictive factors for depression, while Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to explore the causal relationship between BMI and depression/cognitive function. The TyG index was negatively associated with cognitive function scores and positively associated with depression scores in adjusted models (p < 0.001). In fully adjusted subgroup analyses, among obese individuals (BMI ≥ 28), a 100-unit increase in the TyG index was linked to a 3.79-point decrease in depression scores. Machine learning models (Xgboost, AUC = 0.960) identified BMI, TyG-BMI, gender, and comorbidities (e.g., asthma, stroke, emphysema) as key determinants of depression. MR analyses revealed a negative association between BMI and depression risk [OR: 0.9934; 95 % CI (0.9901-0.9968), p = 0.0001] and cognitive dysfunction risk [OR: 0.8514; 95 % CI (0.7929-0.9143), p < 0.05]. No evidence of heterogeneity or pleiotropy was detected. Depression and cognitive impairments were self-reported, potentially introducing bias. The observed associations may be influenced by unmeasured confounders, necessitating further research into the underlying mechanisms. Our findings reveal associations between the TyG index and psychocognitive health in older adults. While these results highlight lipid metabolism as a potential factor in depression and cognitive dysfunction, further studies are needed to validate these findings and explore underlying mechanisms.","2025","Journal of affective disorders"

Machine learning is a useful approach to understanding complex gene expression data to find biomarkers for the diagnosis of OSA. Differentially expressed analysis for OSA and DM data sets obtained from GEO were carried out firstly. Then four machine algorithms were used to screen candidate biomarkers. The diagnostic model was constructed based on key genes, and the accuracy was verified by ROC curve, calibration curve and decision curve. Finally, the CIBERSORT algorithm was used to explore immune cell infiltration in OSA. There were 32 important genes that were considered to be related both in OSA and DM datasets by differentially expressed analysis. Through enrichment analysis, the majority of these genes are enriched in immunological regulation, oxidative stress response, and nervous system control. When consensus characteristics from all four approaches were used to predict OSA diagnosis, STK17A was thought to have a high degree of accuracy. In addition, the diagnostic model demonstrated strong performance and predictive value. Finally, we explored the immune cells signatures of OSA, and STK17A was strongly linked to invasive immune cells. STK17A has been discovered as a gene that can differentiate between individuals with OSA and DM based on four machine learning methods. In addition to offering possible treatment targets for DM-induced OSA, this diagnostic approach can identify high-risk DM patients who also have OSA.","2025","Sleep & breathing = Schlaf & Atmung"

We included 130 patients for development, 77 patients for validation cohort and 25 patients from UNBC and 229 patients from Delaware datasets for external validation. Model area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic for CPOT models were 0.71 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.70, 0.74) on the development cohort, 0.91 (95% CI 0.90, 0.92) on the SFVAMC validation cohort, 0.91 (0.89, 0.93) on UNBC and 0.80 (95% CI 0.75, 0.85) on Delaware. NRS model had lower performance (AUC 0.58 [95% CI 0.55, 0.61]). Brier scores improved following calibration across multiple different techniques. Perturbation models for CPOT models revealed eyebrows, nose, lips, and foreheads were most important for model prediction. Automated nociception detection using computer vision alone is feasible but requires additional testing and validation given small datasets used. Future multicenter observational studies are required to better understand the potential for automated continuous assessments for nociception detection in hospitalized patients.","2025","Anesthesiology"

In this study, artificial intelligence (AI) applied to electrocardiogram (ECG) images was examined as a strategy to predict HF risk. Across multinational cohorts in the Yale New Haven Health System (YNHHS), UK Biobank (UKB), and Brazilian Longitudinal Study of Adult Health (ELSA-Brasil), individuals without baseline HF were followed for the first HF hospitalization. An AI-ECG model that defines cross-sectional left ventricular systolic dysfunction from 12-lead ECG images was used, and its association with incident HF was evaluated. Discrimination was assessed using Harrell's C-statistic. Pooled cohort equations to prevent HF (PCP-HF) were used as a comparator. Among 231 285 YNHHS patients, 4472 had primary HF hospitalizations over 4.5 years (inter-quartile range 2.5-6.6). In UKB and ELSA-Brasil, among 42 141 and 13 454 people, 46 and 31 developed HF over 3.1 (2.1-4.5) and 4.2 (3.7-4.5) years. A positive AI-ECG screen portended a 4- to 24-fold higher risk of new-onset HF [age-, sex-adjusted hazard ratio: YNHHS, 3.88 (95% confidence interval 3.63-4.14); UKB, 12.85 (6.87-24.02); ELSA-Brasil, 23.50 (11.09-49.81)]. The association was consistent after accounting for comorbidities and the competing risk of death. Higher probabilities were associated with progressively higher HF risk. Model discrimination was 0.718 in YNHHS, 0.769 in UKB, and 0.810 in ELSA-Brasil. In YNHHS and ELSA-Brasil, incorporating AI-ECG with PCP-HF yielded a significant improvement in discrimination over PCP-HF alone. An AI model applied to a single ECG image defined the risk of future HF, representing a digital biomarker for stratifying HF risk.","2025","European heart journal"

Current 5hmC analysis methods still present challenges, especially for clinical applications, such as having a risk of false-positive results and a lack of sufficient sensitivity. Herein, a 5hmC quantification method for fragment-specific DNA sequences with extreme specificity, high sensitivity, and clinical applicability was established using a quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR)-based workflow through the combination of enzymatic digestion and biological deamination strategy (EDD-5hmC assay). The EDD-5hmC approach enriched glycosylated 5hmC via enzyme digestion and then APOBEC (apolipoprotein B mRNA editing catalytic polypeptide-like)-mediated deamination to efficiently differentiate between various cytosine(C) modification states, resulting in 5hmC quantification with extreme specificity such that nonspecific amplification is reduced over eight million-fold. Moreover, the nondestructive biological treatment process of the EDD-5hmC assay exhibits high sensitivity, yielding the limit of detection of 30 aM. For the first time, we measured 5hmC levels in colorectal cancer tissues and matched paracancerous tissues to evaluate the ability to differentiate colorectal cancer, with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of up to 82.8% for the single gene of Septin9 and 83.6% for the combinations of Septin9 and Syndecan-2 (SDC2), demonstrating the EDD-5hmC assay is a promising method with clinical applicability for accurately quantifying the 5hmC level.","2025","Analytical chemistry"

Seeking HDC enhancement with a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, we observed marked synergy between olaparib and vorinostat/gemcitabine/busulfan/melphalan (GemBuMel) against lymphoma cell lines, mediated by inhibition of DNA damage repair. Our preclinical work led us to clinically study olaparib/vorinostat/GemBuMel with ASCT. Patients ages 15-65 with refractory lymphoma and adequate end-organ function were eligible for this phase I trial. The olaparib dose was escalated from 25 mg PO BID on days (d)-11 to -3, plus vorinostat (1,000 mg PO/d, d-10 to -3), gemcitabine (2,475 mg/m2/d IV, d-8 and -3), busulfan (target AUC 4,000 μM.min-1/d IV, d-8 to -5), melphalan (60 mg/m2/d IV, d-3 and -2), and rituximab (CD20+ tumors) (375 mg/m2, d-10), with ASCT. Fifty patients were enrolled (23 Hodgkin, 18 DLBCL, 9 T-NHL); median age 35 (range, 20-61); median 3 prior lines of therapy (range, 2-7); 17 patients had previously relapsed after CAR-T or other cellular immunotherapies; 23 patients had PET-positive tumors at HDC (9 in progression). An olaparib dose of 150 mg PO BID was identified as the recommended phase 2 dose. The main extramedullary toxicity was mucositis. The ORR/CR rates were 100%/90%. At median follow-up of 30 months (range, 12-56) months, the EFS/OS rates were 72%/82%, and 71%/88% in patients with prior CAR-T cell failure.

This study is part of the Quantitative Susceptibility Biomarker and Brain Structural Property for Cerebral Cavernous Malformation Related Epilepsy (CRESS) cohort, a prospective multicenter study. QSM was used to quantify iron deposition in patients with sporadic cerebral cavernous malformation (CCMs). Lesions were segmented into intralesional, perilesional, and extralesional areas, with mean susceptibility values calculated for each subregion and analyzed in relation to epilepsy severity and duration. Among the 46 patients studied, those with a history of epilepsy had significantly higher iron deposition values in the perilesional (p =.012) and extralesional areas (p =.01), as well as a greater extent of iron deposition (p <.001) compared to those without epilepsy. The extent of iron deposition effectively distinguished patients with and without epilepsy, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.901 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.816-0.985). Among patients with epilepsy, iron deposition in the extralesional area was positively correlated with the severity of epilepsy (r2 = 0.181, p =.043), and the extent of iron deposition was positively correlated with the duration of epilepsy (r2 =.214, p =.026).

Group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM) was utilized to demonstrate the overall trend of laboratory indicators and their correlation with mortality. Six different machine learning algorithms were employed to develop prognostic models based on the clinical features during the acute phase, which were reduced using Lasso regression. Seven indicators (ALT, AST, BUN, LDH, a-HBDH, DD, and PLT) at 7-10 days post-onset and their change slopes were found to be crucial during disease progression. These, along with other clinical features, were reduced to 8 variables using Lasso regression for model construction. The random forest model demonstrated the best performance in both internal validation (AUC: 0.961) and external validation (AUC: 0.948). Decision Curve Analysis indicated a good balance between model benefits and risks. a-HBDH and its change slope along with central nervous symptom manifestations within 7-10 days after onset accurately predicted mortality in SFTS.

However, the results were controversial. A meta-analysis was conducted to reconfirm their associations and predictive performance. Databases of PubMed, EMBASE, and the Cochrane library were searched. The pooled standardized mean difference (SMD) or odds ratios (ORs) assessed the association, while the pooled area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) evaluated the predictive power. Ninety-four studies were included. Overall and subgroup meta-analyses demonstrated lower ALB and higher CAR were associated with IVIG resistance (ALB: SMD = -0.61; OR = 0.83; CAR: SMD = 1.47; OR = 1.69) and CALs (ALB: SMD = -0.56; OR = 0.92; CAR: SMD = 0.52). PNI was reduced in IVIG-resistant (SMD = -0.82) and coronary artery aneurysm (SMD = -0.18) patients in subgroup analysis and high PNI predicted the decreased risk of CALs in overall analysis (OR = 0.82). ALB, CAR, and PNI were a good or fair biomarker for differentiating IVIG-resistant (CALs) from IVIG-sensitive (non-CALs) patients (AUC > 0.6 or > 0.7). PA (SMD = -0.72) and BAR (SMD = 1.10) were differential in IVIG-resistant, but not in CAL patients compared with controls. AGR was not associated with CALs (p > 0.05).

A retrospective analysis was performed on 115 patients diagnosed with CIN and 37 patients with chronic cervicitis, all of whom underwent surgical intervention. The expression levels of Netrin-1 were evaluated through immunohistochemical staining and quantitative fluorescence PCR. Doppler ultrasound was employed to quantify flow index (FI), vascularization index (VI), and vascularization flow index (VFI) using VOCAL software. Statistical analyses, including correlation analysis, logistic regression, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, were conducted to assess the predictive value of Netrin-1 expression and ultrasound-derived blood flow parameters. FI, VI, and VFI increased with CIN grade, showing significant differences between CIN II, CIN III, and the control group (P < 0.05). Netrin-1 levels were negatively correlated with FI, VI, and VFI (correlation coefficients of -0.287, -0.309, and -0.298; P < 0.05). Logistic regression indicated that Netrin-1 positivity was a protective factor against CIN III, while FI, VI, and VFI were risk factors. The AUC for Netrin-1 was 0.712, with sensitivity and specificity of 76.4% and 79.5% (P < 0.05). Netrin-1 expression is significantly reduced in CIN patients, whereas Doppler ultrasound-derived blood flow parameters-FI, VI, and VFI-are markedly elevated. Both Netrin-1 levels and these ultrasound parameters exhibit a strong correlation with the severity of cervical lesions. Notably, Netrin-1 is negatively correlated with FI, VI, and VFI. Furthermore, Netrin-1 positivity serves as a protective factor against CIN III lesions, while elevated levels of FI, VI, and VFI are associated with increased risk for these lesions. The expression levels of both Netrin-1 and ultrasound parameters provide valuable predictive insights for the early screening, diagnosis, and prevention of cervical cancer.","2025","International journal of women's health"

Currently, there is an absence of an optimal strategy for distinguishing between active tuberculosis (aTB) and LTBI. While some researchers have explored cytokines other than interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) as biomarkers, results have shown significant variability in their ability to differentiate between these conditions. This meta-analysis aims to evaluate the performance of activation phenotype and chemokine markers in distinguishing between aTB and LTBI. To assess the diagnostic accuracy of specific biomarkers (HLA-DR+ IFNγ+, CD38+ IFNγ+, MCP-1, and RANTES) in differentiating aTB from LTBI. This study was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA guidelines for systematic reviews and meta-analyses of diagnostic studies. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, Scopus, Sciences Direct, and Web of Science for primary studies published in English up to 2023. Studies were included if they reported sensitivity, specificity, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR), and area under the curve (AUC) for the biomarkers in question. We calculated pooled diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, DOR, and AUC, and used the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (SROC) to summarize the diagnostic performance of each biomarker. Sixteen studies involving 1696 participants were included in the analysis. Among them, 925 individuals were diagnosed with aTB, while 771 were classified as having LTBI.

The peripheral blood (neutrophil + monocyte)/lymphocyte ratio (NMLR) can predict the clinical outcomes of several inflammatory diseases. However, its prognostic value in COPD remains unknown. This retrospective study included 870 patients with COPD due to acute exacerbation, and the 5-year all-cause mortality of these patients was recorded. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compare the mortality risk of these patients according to their NMLR value. Multivariable COX hazard regression and restricted cubic spline model were used to assess the relationship between the NMLR and 5-year all-cause mortality of patients with COPD. The NMLR values of non-surviving patients with COPD were significantly increased compared to the survivors [3.88 (2.53-7.17) vs 2.95 (2.08-4.89), P=0.000]. The area under the NMLR receiver operating characteristic curve for predicting the 5-year all-cause mortality of COPD patients was 0.63. Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that the 5-year all-cause mortality of COPD patients was significantly increased when the admission peripheral blood NMLR was ≥ 5.90 (27.3% vs 12.4%, P=0.000). The COX regression model showed that NMLR was an independent predictor of 5-year all-cause mortality in COPD patients (hazard ratio=1.84, 95% confidence interval: 1.28-2.64, P=0.001). Moreover, the restricted cubic spline model showed a non-linear relationship between NMLR and COPD death risk (Pnon-linear < 0.05). The admission peripheral blood NMLR is a significant predictor of 5-year all-cause mortality in patients with COPD, and high NMLR values may indicate a poor clinical prognosis.","2025","International journal of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease"

We used ensemble machine learning of different presence-only and presence-absence models, all subjected to hyperparameter tuning and variable decorrelation. The cross-validated ensemble model was found to have AUC=0.76-0.93 and TSS =0.45-0.81, which indicates that the models are performing better than random chance. We found that neighborhoods with (a) short distances to the main city, (b) short distances to roads, and (c) with densest road network all drive overweight-obese cases. The latter (c) contrasts the findings in Western developed countries because of delimiting factors in a tropical developing country related to active public transport, crime, weather, the walkability of roads, and even the COVID-19 restrictions during the time of the surveys. The probability distribution maps revealed that the older adults in the Philippine case cities were mostly overweight-obese, especially within and nearby city centers.

The NAR score successfully segregated NPC patients into two categories with significantly different OS (HR = 0.536; 95 % CI: 0.296-0.972, P = 0.040). Through multivariate analysis, factors such as age, T stage, N stage, and NAR score were identified as independent predictors of OS, leading to the creation of a prognostic nomogram. This nomogram demonstrated superior predictive capability for OS [C-index = 0.702 (95 % CI: 0.636-0.768)], surpassing that of the conventional staging system [C-index = 0.651 (95 % CI: 0.549-0.752)]. The findings underwent internal validation within an independent cohort.

We aimed to evaluate LV function using two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) speckle-tracking echocardiography in patients with HFpEF with and without T2D, and to investigate its prognostic significance. A total of 335 patients with HFpEF were prospectively enrolled for echocardiographic evaluation. LV GLS was obtained using 2D- and 3D-speckle-tracking echocardiography. Cox proportional hazards regression was used to determine predictors of adverse outcomes. The C-index, Akaike information criterion, integrated discrimination improvement, and net reclassification improvement were used to assess model performance and discriminative ability. LV 2D-GLS and 3D-GLS were impaired in patients with HFpEF and T2D compared with those without T2D. After a median follow-up of 17.6 months, 150 patients experienced adverse outcomes. Both 2D-GLS (hazard ratio, 1.323 [95% CI, 1.225-1.429]; P<0.001) and 3D-GLS (hazard ratio, 1.412 [95% CI, 1.316-1.515]; P<0.001) were independent predictors of adverse outcomes in patients with HFpEF after adjustment for confounders. The predictive accuracy of a model incorporating 3D-GLS (Akaike information criterion=-583.9, C-index=0.775 [95% CI, 0.742-0.808]) was superior to models using 2D-GLS (Akaike information criterion=-533.3, C-index=0.719 [95% CI, 0.678-0.760], ΔC-index=0.056; P=0.034) and LV ejection fraction (Akaike information criterion=-498.9, C-index=0.659 [95% CI, 0.610-0.708], ΔC-index=0.116; P<0.001). The addition of 2D-GLS and 3D-GLS to the base model significantly enhanced its discriminatory and predictive abilities (integrated discrimination improvement=0.225 and 0.280; net reclassification improvement=0.612 and 0.734, respectively, P<0.001 for all). LV 2D-GLS and 3D-GLS are impaired in patients with HFpEF and T2D, and are independent predictors of adverse outcomes. Moreover, 3D-GLS provides incremental prognostic value over 2D-GLS.

Given changes in patient characteristics and treatments over time, a contemporary risk model for patients with acute myocardial infarction (MI) is needed. Data from 313 825 acute MI hospitalizations between January 2019 and December 2020 for adults aged ≥18 years at 784 sites in the National Cardiovascular Data Registry Chest Pain-MI Registry were used to develop a risk-standardized model to predict in-hospital mortality. The sample was randomly divided into 70% development (n=220 014) and 30% validation (n=93 811) samples, and 23 separate registry-based patient characteristics at presentation were considered for model inclusion using stepwise logistic regression with 1000 bootstrapped samples. A simplified risk score was also developed for individual risk stratification. The mean age of the study cohort was 65.3 (SD 13.1) years, and 33.6% were women. The overall in-hospital mortality rate was 5.0% (n=15 822 deaths). The final model included 14 variables, with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest, cardiogenic shock, and ST-segment elevation MI as the strongest independent predictors of mortality. The model also included age, comorbidities (dyslipidemia, diabetes, prior percutaneous coronary intervention, cerebrovascular disease, and peripheral artery disease), heart failure on admission, heart rate, systolic blood pressure, glomerular filtration rate, and hemoglobin. The model demonstrated excellent discrimination (C-statistic, 0.868 [95% CI 0.865-0.871]) and good calibration, with similar performance across subgroups based on MI type, periods before and during the COVID-19 pandemic, and hospital volume. The simplified risk score included values from 0 to 25, with mortality risk ranging from 0.3% with a score of 0 to 1 up to 49.4% with a score >11. This contemporary risk model accurately predicts in-hospital mortality for patients with acute MI and can be used for risk standardization across hospitals and at the bedside for patient prognostication.","2025","Circulation.

Early identification of violence risk during institutional stay can help prevent violent incidents. As such, this study assessed the predictive accuracy of the Violence Risk Assessment Checklist for Youth (V-RISK-Y) aged 12-18 in two different juvenile settings providing 24-hour services for youth. Institutions were included from child and adolescent inpatient psychiatry and residential youth care under child protective services. A prospective, naturalistic observational study design was employed. V-RISK-Y was administered for youth admitted to four acute inpatient psychiatric units and four acute residential youth care institutions. Incidents of violence and threats during the youth's stay were registered by institutional staff. In total, 517 youth were included in analyses, 59 of whom were registered with at least one incident of violence or threats during their stay. Area under curve (AUC) and logistic regression analyses were used to assess predictive accuracy and validity of V-RISK-Y. For the overall sample, V-RISK-Y had good predictive accuracy, and the sum score of V-RISK-Y significantly predicted registered violent incidents. Stratified analyses indicated good predictive accuracy of V-RISK-Y for the inpatient units, but not for the residential youth care institutions. Findings imply that V-RISK-Y is accurate in identifying violence risk for youth admitted to inpatient psychiatric units but has limited predictive accuracy in residential youth care institutions.

The risk for perioperative bleeding in patients with amyloidosis remains controversial. In this study, we aimed to compare the bleeding risk of tissue biopsies for a definitive diagnosis between patients with and without amyloidosis, identify risk factors, and generate a prediction model for bleeding risk in these patients. We enrolled patients aged >15 years who had amyloidosis as part of their differential diagnosis before tissue biopsy. After obtaining histopathological reports, we randomly selected patients with and without amyloidosis at a ratio of 4:1. A total of 360 patients were enrolled before tissue biopsy. Bleeding complications were observed in 5.6% and 4.2% of patients with and without amyloidosis, respectively. Amyloidosis was not associated with an increased perioperative bleeding risk (adjusted odds ratio 1.19; 95% confidence interval 0.17-8.41, p = 0.859). Kidney biopsy was a significant risk factor for perioperative bleeding in tissue biopsies. A KiHPL model was generated to predict the bleeding risk. The area under the curve was 0.87, with a good calibration plot for this model. Amyloidosis is not associated with an increased risk of bleeding in tissue biopsies.

Complete blood count (CBC) results of 424 children with MP infection and 150 health children were collected. NLR, MLR, PLR, SII and SIRI, were respectively calculated. Shapiro-Wilk test, Student's t-test, Mann-Whitney U-test and Pearson chi-squared test were used to analyze the clinical data of the patients and participants. Multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted based on the results of single factor analysis. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was drawn to evaluate the potential of the above biomarkers for MP infection. Compared with the control group, white blood cell (WBC) count, neutrophil (NEU) count, monocyte (MON) count, NLR, MLR, PLR, SII and SIRI were significantly higher and lymphocyte count (LYM) and platelet (PLT) were significantly lower than those in MP group. The results of multivariate logistic regression analysis indicate that MLR and SIRI can serve as major risk factors for MP infection in children. The predictive accuracy of logistic regression model based on MLR and SIRI is 83.28%. The area under the curve (AUC) results showed that SIRI has better predicting value of MP infection (AUC = 0.892, Sensitivity = 75.7%, Specificity = 92.0%).

Nonetheless, identifying tumor tissues with a mesenchymal phenotype remains challenging in clinical practice. In this study, we validated the correlation between EMT status and resistance to endocrine therapy in ER+ breast cancer from a transcriptomic perspective. To confirm the presence of morphological discrepancies in tumor tissues of ER+ breast cancer classified as epithelial- and mesenchymal-phenotypes according to EMT-related transcriptional features, we trained deep learning algorithms based on EfficientNetV2 architecture to assign the phenotypic status for each patient utilizing hematoxylin & eosin (H&E)-stained slides from The Cancer Genome Atlas database. Our classifier model accurately identified the precise phenotypic status, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.886 at the tile-level and an AUC of 0.910 at the slide-level. Furthermore, we evaluated the efficacy of the classifier in predicting endocrine response using data from an independent ER+ breast cancer patient cohort. Our classifier achieved a predicting accuracy of 81.25%, and 88.7% slides labeled as endocrine resistant were predicted as the mesenchymal-phenotype, while 75.6% slides labeled as sensitive were predicted as the epithelial-phenotype.

All patients who underwent TAVI with accessible AVCS from the preprocedural CT scan report were included in this retrospective single-centre study. The primary endpoint was the occurrence of a conductive disturbance requiring PPM at 30 days. The association between PPM and AVCS, with its incremental prognostic value, was analysed using multivariable logistic regression, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and likelihood ratio (LR) test. We included 761 patients of which 125 (16%) required PPM at 30 days. AVCS score was significantly higher in patients requiring PPM (3788 (2487-5218) vs 3050 (2043-4367) AU, p<0.001). Using multivariable analysis, preprocedural right bundle branch block (RBBB) (OR 6.61, 95% CI 3.82 to 11.5, p<0.001), first atrioventricular block (OR 1.71, 95% CI 1.03 to 2.83, p=0.037), self-expanding valve (OR 3.25, 95% CI 1.17 to 9.09, p=0.025) and AVCS>4510 AU (OR 1.83, 95% CI 1.04 to 3.20, p=0.035) were independently associated with PPM. AVCS had an incremental discriminative value (C-index 0.79 vs 0.77, LR test p=0.036) over and above traditional PPM risk factors. An algorithm was proposed based on the initial presence of RBBB, AVCS and the type of implanted valve. Even if RBBB remained the strongest predictor of PPM post-TAVI, this study suggests that a high AVCS may help identifying patients at increased risk of PPM after TAVI, especially among those without pre-existing RBBB.","2025","Open heart"

From a database of 6293 CCTA scans, we used pre-existing curved multiplanar reformations (CMR) images of the LAD, RCA and LCX arteries to create end-to-end deep-learning models for the detection of moderate or severe stenoses. We preprocessed the images by exploiting domain knowledge and employed a transfer learning approach using EfficientNet, ResNet, DenseNet and Inception-ResNet, with a class-weighted strategy optimised through cross-validation. Heatmaps were generated to indicate critical areas identified by the models, aiding clinicians in understanding the model's decision-making process. Among the 900 CMR cases, 279 involved the LAD artery, 259 the RCA artery and 253 the LCX artery. EfficientNet models outperformed others, with EfficientNetB3 and EfficientNetB0 demonstrating the highest accuracy for LAD, EfficientNetB2 for RCA and EfficientNetB0 for LCX. The area under the curve for receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) reached 0.95 for moderate and 0.94 for severe stenosis in the LAD. For the RCA, the AUROC was 0.92 for both moderate and severe stenosis detection. The LCX achieved an AUROC of 0.88 for the detection of moderate stenoses, though the calibration curve exhibited significant overestimation. Calibration curves matched probabilities for the LAD but showed discrepancies for the RCA. Heatmap visualisations confirmed the models' precision in delineating stenotic lesions. Decision curve analysis and net reclassification index assessments reinforced the efficacy of EfficientNet models, confirming their superior diagnostic capabilities.

We aimed to develop and externally validate an end-to-end deep learning model for predicting recurrence risk in cervical cancer patients following surgery by using multiparametric MRI images. The clinicopathologic data and multiparametric MRI images of 406 cervical cancer patients from three institutions were collected. We designed a novel deep learning model called ""ConvXGB"" for predicting recurrence risk by combining the convolutional neural network (CNN) and eXtreme Gradient Boost (XGBoost). The predictive performance of the ConvXGB model was evaluated using time-dependent area under curve (AUC), compared with the deep learning radio-clinical model, clinical model, conventional radiomics nomogram and an existing histology-specific tool. The potential of the ConvXGB model in predicting the recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) was assessed. The ConvXGB model outperformed other models in predicting recurrence risk, with AUCs for 1 and 3 year-RFS of 0.872(95% CI, 0.857-0.906) and 0.882(95% CI, 0.860-0.904) respectively in the test cohort. This model showed better discrimination, calibration and clinical utility. Grad-CAM analysis was adopted to help clinicians better understand the predictive results. Moreover, Kaplan-Meier survival analysis revealed that patients who were stratified into high-risk group by the ConvXGB model were significantly susceptible to higher cumulative recurrence risk rates and worse outcome. The ConvXGB model allowed for predicting postoperative recurrence risk in cervical cancer patients and for stratifying the risk of RFS and OS.","2025","Translational oncology"

This study aims to develop and validate machine learning (ML) models for predicting 28-day mortality in intensive care units (ICUs). Data were extracted from the Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care IV(MIMIC-IV) database, focusing on elderly neurocritical ill patients with ICU stays ≥ 24 h. The cohort was split into 70 % for training and 30 % for internal validation. We analyzed 58 variables, including demographics, vital signs, medications, lab results, comorbidities, and medical scores, using Lasso regression to identify predictors of 28-day mortality. Seven ML algorithms were evaluated, and the best model was validated with data from Guizhou Medical University Affiliated Hospital. A log-rank test was used to assess survival differences in Kaplan-Meier curves. Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) were used to interpret the best model, while subgroup analysis identified variations in model performance across different populations. The study included 1,773 elderly neurocritically ill patients, with a 28-day mortality rate of 28.6 %. The Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM) outperformed other models, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.896 in internal validation and 0.812 in external validation. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that higher LightGBM prediction scores correlated with lower survival probabilities. Key predictors identified through SHAP analysis included partial pressure of arterial carbon dioxide (PaCO2), Acute physiology and chronic health evaluation II (APACHE II), white blood cell count, age, and lactate. The LightGBM model demonstrated consistent performance across various subgroups. The LightGBM model effectively predicts 28-day mortality risk in elderly neurocritically ill patients, aiding clinicians in management and resource allocation.

A bivariate random effects model was employed for data synthesis, and diagnostic performance was reported in terms of pooled sensitivity, specificity, and the area under the summary receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Additionally, meta-regression, subgroup analyses, and sensitivity analyses were performed. A total of 15 studies were included in this meta-analysis, involving 4,063 participants. The overall risk of bias in the included studies was high. The meta-analysis revealed that the pooled sensitivity and specificity across all studies were 0.74 [95 % confidence interval (CI): 0.71-0.78] and 0.75 (95 % CI: 0.70-0.79), respectively, with an AUC of 0.79 (95 % CI: 0.76-0.83).

Approximately 9.6% diagnostic exams were given Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System (BI-RADS) ≥4A, most of which are 4A/4B. Contrast-enhanced mammography (CEM) may improve biopsy outcome prediction for this subpopulation, but machine learning-based analysis of CEM is largely unexplored. We aim to develop a machine learning-based analysis of CEM using computer-extracted radiomics and radiologist-assessed descriptors to predict breast biopsy outcomes of BI-RADS 4A/4B/4C or 5 lesions. This HIPPA-compliant, IRB-approved study included women in a single institution who had BI-RADS 4A/4B/4C or 5 lesions and underwent CEM imaging prior to biopsy. Logistic regression models were built to predict biopsy outcomes using radiomics features and four radiologist-assessed qualitative descriptors. A cohort of 201 patients was used for model development/training, and an independent group of 86 patients were used as an internal test set. AUC was used to measure model's performance. Positive predictive value (PPV) was assessed on subgroups of BI-RADS 4A or 4B lesions. Model AUC was 0.90 for radiomics, 0.81 for clinical descriptors and 0.88 for their combination. On patients with an initial BI-RADS 4A or 4B scores, model combining radiomics and clinical descriptors of pre-biopsy CEM increased PPV3 to 18% from the radiologist's 6% for 4A patients, and to 25% from the radiologist's 17% for 4B patients.

We randomly selected 4000 adults who attended a tertiary hospital ED in England from 1 January 2022 to 31 December 2022 and had NEWS2 routinely recorded on electronic patient records. The first NEWS2 and vital signs were extracted from electronic records. Research nurses selected cases that received a potentially time-critical treatment. Two independent clinical experts then determined whether time-critical treatment was or should have been received using an expert consensus derived list of interventions. We used receiver operating characteristic analysis and calculated sensitivity and specificity at predefined thresholds to evaluate the accuracy of NEWS2 for predicting need for time-critical intervention and, as a secondary outcome, mortality at 7 days. After excluding 10 patients who received their intervention before NEWS2 recording, 164/3990 (4.1%) needed time-critical treatment and 71/3990 (1.8%) died within 7 days. NEWS2 predicted need for time-critical treatment with a c-statistic of 0.807 (95% CI 0.765 to 0.849) and death within 7 days with a c-statistic of 0.865 (95% CI 0.813, 0.917).

Minimal research has examined the accuracy of abortion patients' self-assessment of eligibility for medication abortion using their health history. This step is necessary for ensuring optimal access to history-based or no-test models, as well as potential over-the-counter access. This study aimed to examine the accuracy of pregnant people's eligibility for medication abortion as determined using their self-reported health history, compared with clinician assessments using ultrasound and other tests. In this diagnostic accuracy study, we recruited people seeking medication or procedural abortion from 9 abortion facilities, aged ≥15 years, English- or Spanish-speaking, and with no prior ultrasound conducted at the recruitment facility. Before ultrasound, we surveyed participants on medication abortion eligibility, including estimated gestational duration, medical history, contraindications, and ectopic pregnancy risk factors such as pain and bleeding symptoms. We compared patients' eligibility based on self-reported history with subsequent clinician assessment, focusing on overall diagnostic accuracy, or area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, sensitivity, specificity, and proportion with discordant patient and clinician eligibility assessment, using 77 days as the upper gestational duration limit. Overall, 22.1% of 1386 participants were ineligible for medication abortion according to clinician assessment. Overall diagnostic accuracy of self-assessment was acceptable (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve=0.65; 95% confidence interval, 0.63-0.67), with sensitivity of 92.2% (88.6-94.9) and specificity of 37.8% (34.9-40.7). Very few participants (n=24; 1.7%) self-assessed as eligible when the clinician deemed them ineligible; many more (n=672; 48.5%) self-assessed as ineligible when the clinician deemed them eligible. The most common patient-reported contraindications included unexplained pain (55.5%), gestational duration >77 days (36.5%), and anemia (29.0%). On its own, unexplained pain had poor sensitivity in identifying those with clinician concern for ectopic pregnancy (41.7%; 95% confidence interval, 15.2-72.3). Removing unexplained pain as a screening criterion resulted in higher accuracy (0.71; 95% confidence interval, 0.69-0.74) (P<.001). History-based screening protocols are highly effective at ensuring that few people receive medication abortion when ineligible. However, a sizable group screens as ineligible when they are in fact eligible, suggesting a need for more specific screening questions.","2025","American journal of obstetrics and gynecology"

The inhibitory effect of tunodafil on seven major CYP450 enzymes in human liver microsomes was investigated by probe substrate method. The effect of tunodafil on the pharmacokinetics of omeprazole (CYP2C19 substrate) in 40 healthy subjects, who received a single dose of 40 mg omeprazole in combination with tunodafil on the day 8 after taking 100 mg tunodafil daily for 7 days, was assessed based on CYP2C19 genotypes. The clinical DDI of ritonavir (potent CYP3A4 inhibitor) on tunodafil was studied in 28 healthy subjects who received a single dose of 50 mg tunodafil in combination with ritonavir on the day 6 after taking ritonavir twice a day for 5 days. Tunodafil showed moderate inhibition on CYP2C19 and CYP3A4/5 in vitro. When co-administration omeprazole with tunodafil, the AUC of omeprazole in the Extensive, Intermediate and Poor Metabolizers increased by 26 %, 37 % and 21 %, respectively. After co-administration tunodafil with ritonavir, ritonavir increased the AUC and Cmax of tunodafil in human by about 78- fold and 13-fold respectively. Tunodafil slightly increased omeprazole exposure in the Extensive and Intermediate Metabolizers of CYP2C19, but had no significant effect on omeprazole exposure in the Poor Metabolizers. Ritonavir could strongly inhibit the metabolism of tunodafil, and the combination of tunodafil with ritonavir should be prohibited.","2025","European journal of pharmaceutical sciences : official journal of the European Federation for Pharmaceutical Sciences"

This study aims to evaluate the performance of machine learning approaches in predicting grade 2 + xerostomia in adults with HNC receiving proton and carbon ion radiotherapy. A retrospective study involving 1,769 adults with HNC who completed proton or carbon ion radiotherapy was conducted. Xerostomia was graded using the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group criteria. Eight machine learning models with different combinations sampling methods and class weights were compared to identify the model with the highest balanced accuracy. The mean age of patients was 47.8 years (range 18-80), with 33.5 % female. The average total radiation dose was 71.0 GyE (SD = 5.7).

Feature selection involved univariable logistic regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, stepwise backward regression, and Spearman's correlation test, with the bootstrap method ensuring reliability. Multivariable models were built on the training set and evaluated using the test set. The optimal NTCP model incorporated a DVH parameter (V37Gy [relative biological effectiveness, RBE]), radiomics, and dosiomics features, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.932 in the training set and 0.959 in the test set.

We evaluated the predictive performance of machine learning models on imbalanced outcomes from the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (USNHANES) without using sampling weights. Four machine learning models (support vector machine, random forest, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and deep neural network) were compared with a logistic model that incorporates the survey's complex sampling design. Three resampling methods (oversampling, undersampling, and combined) were used to address class imbalance during the model training process. For all models, the balanced accuracy was similar (ranging from 0.72 to 0.76) and the specificity was smaller than sensitivity except for random forest. The support vector machine and neural networks performed best with sensitivity (ranging from 0.79 to 0.83), while the random forest had the largest specificity (ranging from 0.86 to 0.96), with one exception. PR-AUC scores and Brier scores were low ranging from 0.2529 to 0.3313 (lower scores worse) and 0.1005-0.3245 (lower scores better), respectively CONCLUSIONS: The machine learning models had overall similar predictive capacity to the recommended methods which integrate the complex sampling design for the prediction of osteoarthritis occurrence with USNHANES.","2025","Annals of epidemiology"

Dysregulated succinylation has been implicated in the onset and progression of various diseases, including liver, cardiac, pulmonary, and neurological disorders. However, identifying succinylation sites through experimental methods is often labor-intensive, costly, and technically challenging. To address this, we introduce an approach called CbiLSuccSite, that integrates Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) with Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) networks for the accurate prediction of protein succinylation sites. Our approach employs a word embedding layer to encode protein sequences, enabling the automatic learning of intricate patterns and dependencies without manual feature extraction. In 10-fold cross-validation, CBiLSuccSite achieved superior predictive performance, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.826 and a Matthews Correlation Coefficient (MCC) of 0.502. Independent testing further validated its robustness, yielding an AUC of 0.818 and an MCC of 0.53. The integration of CNN and Bi-LSTM leverages the strengths of both architectures, establishing CBiLSuccSite as an effective tool for protein language processing and succinylation site prediction.

We recruited 24 psychotic PBD (P-PBD) patients, 24 non-psychotic PBD (NP-PBD) patients, and 18 healthy controls (HCs). All participants underwent scanning with a 3.0 T Siemens Trio scanner. The FreeSurfer 7.4.0 software was employed to calculate the volume of each subcortical structure. An analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed to identify brain regions with significant volume differences among the three groups, and then the inter-group comparisons were calculated. Partial correlation analyses were conducted to identify relationships between subcortical structural volumes and clinical features. Finally, receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was employed to verify the capacity to distinguish between P-PBD and NP-PBD, P-PBD and HCs, and NP-PBD and HCs. ANCOVA revealed significant differences in the volumes of bilateral lateral ventricles, third ventricle, left thalamus, and right pallidum among three groups. Compared with HC, the third ventricle volume was increased in both groups of PBD patients, whereas the left thalamus and right pallidum volumes were decreased, and the bilateral lateral ventricles were enlarged in P-PBD patients. In contrast, only the third ventricle showed further enlargement in the group of P-PBD patients compared with NP-PBD patients. Partial correlation analyses revealed that episode times were associated with the third ventricle volume in P-PBD patients. Furthermore, ROC analyses indicated that volume in the left lateral ventricle exhibited the greatest capacity to distinguish between the P-PBD and NP-PBD, and the third ventricle performed best in distinguishing both the P-PBD group from HCs and the NP-PBD group from HCs. The combined metrics demonstrated greater diagnostic value in two-by-two comparisons. Current research suggests that PBD with psychotic symptoms may have more extensive lateral and third ventricular volume enlargement. Bilateral lateral ventricles may serve as potential neurobiomarkers to distinguish P- PBD patients from NP-PBD patients.","2025","Psychiatry research. Neuroimaging"

This study recorded sit-to-stand transition test data from three groups: community-dwelling elderly, elderly in day care centers (DCC), and college students, captured using mobile phone cameras. We employed pose estimation technology to extract key point kinematic features from the video data and used 10-fold cross-validation to train a random forest classifier, mitigating the impact of individual differences. We trained classifiers with the top 5, 10, and 15 features, calculating the average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each model to compare feature importance. Our results indicated that elbow key point features, such as (KP08) mean Y, (KP08)RMS Y, (KP09) mean Y, and (KP09) RMS Y, are crucial for distinguishing between subject groups. Statistical tests further validated the significance of these features. The application of human pose estimation and key point signals shows promise for clinical postural balance screening. The identified features can be utilized to develop non-invasive tools for assessing postural instability risk, contributing to fall prevention efforts. This study lays the groundwork for integrating additional measurement modalities into sit-to-stand transition analysis to enhance clinical strategies.","2025","Gait & posture"

The dataset includes 288 individuals with suspected α-thalassemia from Sri Lanka. It was classified using eleven discriminant formulae and nine ML models. Outliers were removed using Mahalanobis distance, and resampling was conducted with the synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) and SMOTE-nominal continuous (NC). The Mann-Whitney U test handled feature extraction and class grouping. ML performance was evaluated with eight criteria. The Ehsani formula achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) of 0.66 by grouping silent- and non-carriers. The convolutional neural network (CNN) without feature extraction demonstrated better performance, with an accuracy of 0.85, sensitivity of 0.8, specificity of 0.86, and ROC-AUC of 0.95/0.93 (micro/macro). Performance was maintained even without preprocessing. ML models outperformed classical discriminant formulae in classifying α-thalassemia using sex and CBC features. A larger dataset could enhance ML model generalization and the impact of feature extraction. Grouping silent- and non-carriers improved ML results, especially with resampling.

The negative predictive value (NPV) was 90.6 % for the 4-point DECAF score and 96.2 % for a 0.075 ng/mL procalcitonin cut-off. Notably, when used in combination, the NPV reached 100 % (95 % CI: 89.1-100). The DECAF score and serum procalcitonin levels both exhibit robust prognostic capabilities in excluding adverse outcomes in AECOPD patients, with their predictive accuracy enhanced when used in tandem.","2025","The American journal of emergency medicine"

While deep learning has advanced DTI prediction accuracy, challenges remain: (i) existing methods often lack generalizability, with performance dropping significantly on unseen proteins and cross-domain settings; (ii) current molecular relational learning often overlooks subpocket-level interactions, which are vital for a detailed understanding of binding sites. We introduce SP-DTI, a subpocket-informed transformer model designed to address these challenges through: (i) detailed subpocket analysis using the Cavity Identification and Analysis Routine (CAVIAR) for interaction modeling at both global and local levels, and (ii) integration of pre-trained language models into graph neural networks to encode drugs and proteins, enhancing generalizability to unlabeled data. Benchmark evaluations show that SP-DTI consistently outperforms state-of-the-art models, achieving a ROC-AUC of 0.873 in unseen protein settings, an 11% improvement over the best baseline.

Recently, the impact of small tumor size on prognosis has gained attention. This study aimed to investigate whether small tumor size can be an additional parameter for T3N1 colon cancer prognosis. We retrospectively analyzed 162 consecutive patients with pT3N1 colon cancer between 2010 and 2021. The optimal cutoff value of tumor size was calculated through receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We evaluated survival through the Kaplan-Meier method, and the risk of prognosis through multivariate Cox models. The optimal cutoff value of tumor size was 45 mm. The recurrence rate was significantly higher in tumor size < 45 mm than in ≥ 45 mm (25.7% vs. 12.0%, p = 0.037). Tumor size < 45 mm also had lower overall survival (OS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and cancer-specific survival (CSS) than its counterpart (p = 0.03 for all). In multivariate analyses, age ≥ 70 years, undifferentiated histological type, and tumor size < 45 mm were independent prognostic factors for OS (p = 0.025, p = 0.001, p < 0.04, respectively), whereas tumor size < 45 mm was the only independent prognostic factor for RFS (p = 0.043). Meanwhile, the independent prognostic factors for CSS were undifferentiated histological type and tumor size < 45 mm (p = 0.008 for both). Small tumor size is associated with poor prognosis in pT3N1 colon cancer cases. Thus, small tumors potentially have biologically aggressive features.","2025","World journal of surgery"

In a prospective study, g-SoS was assessed in the upper-outer breast quadrant of 100 women, with 92 of them also having m-ACR assessed by two radiologists across the entire breast. For g-SoS, ultrasonic waves were transmitted from varying transducer locations and the image misalignments between these were then related analytically to breast SoS. To test reproducibility, two consecutive g-SoS acquisitions each were taken at two similar breast locations by the same operator. Measurements were found highly repeatable, with a mean absolute difference ± standard deviation of 3.16 ± 3.79 m/s. Multiple measurements were combined yielding a single g-SoS estimate per each patient, which strongly correlated to m-ACR categories (Spearman's = 0.773). The g-SoS values for categories A-D were 1459.6 ± 0.74, 1475.6 ± 15.92, 1515.6 ± 27.10, and 1545.7 ± 20.62, with all groups (except A-B) being significantly different from each other. Dense breasts (m-ACR C&D) were classified with 100% specificity at 78% sensitivity, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.931. Extremely dense breasts (m-ACR D) were classified with 100% sensitivity at 77.5% specificity (AUC = 0.906). Quantitative g-SoS measurement of the breast was shown feasible and repeatable using conventional US machines, with values correlating strongly with m-ACR assessments. Question Breast density is a strong predictor of risk for breast cancer, which frequently develops in dense tissue regions. Therefore, density assessment calls for refined non-ionizing methods. Findings Quantitative global speed-of-sound (g-SoS) measurement of the breast is shown to be feasible using conventional US machines, repeatable, and able to classify breast density with high accuracy. Clinical relevance Being effective in classifying dense breasts, where mammography has reduced sensitivity, g-SoS can help stratify patients for alternative modalities. Ideal day for mammography or MRI can be determined by monitoring g-SoS. Furthermore, g-SoS can be integrated into personalized risk assessment.","2025","European radiology"

The microbiota in the nasal cavity of AECRS patients and its association with disease severity has rarely been studied. This study aimed to characterize nasal dysbiosis in a prospective cohort of patients with AECRS. We performed a cross-sectional study of 28 patients with AECRS, 20 patients with chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) without acute exacerbation (AE), and 29 healthy controls using 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Subjective and objective assessments of CRS disease severity during AE were also collected. Compared to healthy controls and patients with CRS without AE, AECRS presented with a substantial decrease of the Corynebacterium_1 and a significant increase of Ralstonia and Acinetobacter at the genus level (LDA score > 2.0 [P < 0.05]). Furthermore, genera with a mean relative abundance (MRA) of less than 1% were defined as rare components based on published studies, then 29 genera with a substantial alteration in AECRS were rare constituents of the microbiome, of which 18 rare genera were highly associated with subjective and objective disease severity. Moreover, a combination of 15 genera could differentiate patients with AECRS with an area under the curve of 0.870 (95% CI = 0.784-0.955). Prediction of microbial functional pathways involved significantly enhanced lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis pathways and significantly decreased folate biosynthesis, sulfur relay system, and cysteine and methionine metabolism pathways in patients with AECRS. The rare nasal microbiota (MRA < 1%) correlated with disease status and disease severity in patients with AECRS. The knowledge about the pattern of the nasal microbiome and its metabolomic pathway may contribute to the fundamental understanding of AECRS pathophysiology.","2025","Inflammation research : official journal of the European Histamine Research Society ...

A retrospective cohort of 7871 patients undergoing primary THA was identified from an established arthroplasty database. Patient demographics, ASA grade, socioeconomic status, OHS and EuroQol questionnaire were collected preoperatively and at 1 and 2 years postoperatively. Regression analysis was used to identify independent preoperative factors associated with achieving a ceiling score. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to identify preoperative OHS's that predicted a postoperative ceiling score. The ceiling effect (proportion achieving the maximal score) at 1 year was 21.8% (n = 1372) which increased significantly (p < 0.001) to 26.6% (n = 1569) at 2 years. Female gender (p ≤ 0.028), younger age (p < 0.001), decreasing socioeconomic deprivation (only for 2-year OHS), a better preoperative OHS (p < 0.001) or EQ-VAS (p < 0.001) were independently associated with a ceiling OHS postoperatively. The preoperative OHS was demonstrated to be a  poor discriminator of achieving postoperative ceiling score at 1 year (AUC 62.4%, 95% CI 60.7 to 64.1, p < 0.001) and 2 years (AUC 61.5%, 95% CI 60.0 to 63.2). Those achieving a postoperative ceiling OHS at 1 and 2 years had statistically significant (p < 0.001) greater improvements in their OHS, EQ-5D and EQ-VAS and were more likely to have achieved a minimal important change in their OHS relative to their preoperative baseline and a postoperative patient acceptable symptom state. The OHS demonstrated moderate ceiling effects at both 1 and 2 years following THA, and the preoperative score was a predictor of achieving a ceiling score. However, it would seem the ceiling effect did not limit the potential for improvements relative to baseline and achieving clinically meaningful values in the OHS.","2025","European journal of orthopaedic surgery & traumatology : orthopedie traumatologie"

The study cohort included all patients with genetically confirmed LQTS evaluated in the Windland Smith Rice Genetic Heart Rhythm Clinic and controls from Mayo Clinic's ECG data vault comprising more than 2.5 million patients. For the AI-DNN model, every patient and control with 1 or more ECGs above age- and sex-specific 99th percentile values for QTc (>460 ms for all patients [male/female] <13 years of age or >470 ms for men and >480 ms for women above this age) were included. LQTS patients were age and sex matched to controls at a 1:5 ratio. An AI-DNN involving a multilayer convolutional neural network was developed to classify patients. Of the 1,599 patients with genetically confirmed LQTS, 808 had 1 or more ECGs with QTc above the defined thresholds (2987 ECGs) compared with 361,069 of 2.5 million controls (14% of Mayo Clinic patients having an ECG, ""presumed negative""; 989,313 ECGs). Following age and sex matching and splitting, 3,309 (training), 411 (validation), and 887 (testing) ECGs were used. This model distinguished patients with LQTS from those with acquired QT prolongation with an area under the curve of 0.896 (accuracy 85%, sensitivity 77%, specificity 87%). The model remained robust with areas under the curve close to or above 0.9, independent of matching ratio (range, 1:5 to 1:2000) or type of ECG data used (rhythm strip of median beat) and after excluding patients with wide QRS or ventricular pacemaker. For patients with a QTc exceeding its 99th percentile values, this novel AI-DNN functions as an LQTS mutation detector, being able to identify patients with abnormal QT prolongation secondary to an LQTS-causative mutation rather than with acquired QT prolongation. This algorithm may facilitate screening for this potentially lethal yet highly treatable genetic heart disease.","2025","Mayo Clinic proceedings"

Through activation of LANCL2, NIM-1324 modulates CD4+ T cells to bias signaling and cellular metabolism toward increased immunoregulatory function while providing similar support to phagocytes. In primary human immune cells, NIM-1324 reduces type I interferon and inflammatory cytokine (IL-6, IL-8) production. Oral NIM-1324 was assessed for safety, tolerability and PK in normal healthy volunteers in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. Subjects (n = 57) were randomized into five single ascending dose (SAD) cohorts (250, 500, 750, 1000, 1500 mg, p.o.) and three multiple ascending dose (MAD) cohorts (250, 750, 1500 mg QD for 7 days, p.o.). NIM-1324 did not increase total AE rates in individual cohorts or pooled active groups in SAD or MAD with no SAEs in the study. Oral NIM-1324 dosing does not result in any clinically significant findings by biochemistry, coagulation, ECG, hematology, or urinalysis when compared to placebo. Plasma exposure, as measured by area under the curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC0-24), scaled dose proportionally over 250-1000 mg. At 250 mg, NIM-1324 successfully engaged the target with an upregulation of Lancl2 and key transcriptional biomarkers in whole blood. In conclusion, NIM-1324 treatment is well-tolerated up to daily oral doses of at least 1500 mg (nominal), a ≥ six-fold margin over the anticipated therapeutic dose, and 1000 mg (maximum observed exposure), at least a four-fold margin over the anticipated therapeutic dose with no dose limiting toxicities.","2025","Clinical and translational science"

Based on a ratio ≥ 2 or ≤ 0.5 in AUC or Cmax between hepatically impaired participants/healthy controls these were considered ""positive"" or ""negative"". In case of more than one HI severity stratum per compound included in the HI trial, the comparison of the AUC ratios for mild, moderate, or severe HI were used to investigate the increase across HI categories. For the in total 436 hits, relevant PK information could be retrieved for 273 compounds of which 199 were categorized negative, 69 positive ups and 5 positive downs. Fourteen out of 69 compounds demonstrated a steep increase in the AUC ratios from mild to severe HI. Compounds demonstrating a steep increase typically had a high plasma protein binding of > 95%, high volume of distribution, lower absolute bioavailability, minor elimination via the kidneys, were predominantly metabolized by CYP3A4 or CYP2D6 and the majority of these compounds were substrates of OATP1B1. While for compounds with steep increase studies in all severity strata may be warranted they may also offer the potential to estimate the appropriate doses in an HI trial. On the other hand, for compounds with slow or no increase across HI severity strata, reduced HI trials may be justified, e.g. only testing PK in moderate HI.","2025","Clinical and translational science"

Although many risk factor scoring tools exist, many are specific to bloodstream isolates and may not represent all patient populations. The purpose of this study was to create and validate an institution-specific scoring tool for select ESBL-E of non-urinary origin based on previously identified risk factors. This retrospective, case-control analysis included inpatient adults at an academic medical center from July 2021 through August 2023 with a documented ESBL-E or non-ESBL-E infection of non-urinary origin. Patients with ESBL-E isolates were matched in a 1:1 ratio to non-ESBL-E isolates by organism and specimen type. Points for each risk factor were assigned by dividing their respective regression coefficient by half of the smallest regression coefficient and rounding to the nearest integer (prior ESBL-E within the past 12 months: 6 points, urinary catheter: 3 points, central venous catheter: 2 points, cirrhosis: 2 points). Sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) were calculated for each score, and discriminatory power was assessed via the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)-area under the curve (AUC). Of the 1139 identified cultures, 140 patients met the criteria for inclusion into the ESBL-E case arm, thus 140 patients with non-ESBL-E cultures were matched as controls. Baseline characteristics were relatively similar between the groups. A score of 0 was associated with low risk of ESBL-E (PPV 0.31, NPV 0.36), whereas scores between 2 and 5 were considered moderate risk (PPV 0.56, NPV 0.55), and scores ≥6 were associated with high risk (PPV 0.91, NPV 0.56). The ROC curve AUC was 0.705. The majority of ESBL-E risk factor scoring tools are specific to isolates causing bloodstream infections.

Defining the relationship between thoracic morphology and alpha angle is aimed at filling the gap in the literature and improving surgical outcomes. Methods: This retrospective study analyzed 74 patients who underwent the Latarjet procedure for recurrent anterior shoulder instability between 2022 and 2024. All procedures were performed by the same surgeon using a standardized protocol to ensure consistency of surgical technique across cases. In postoperative chest CT scans, alpha angle, anteroposterior diameter of the thorax, transverse diameter of hemithorax, scapular inclination, and glenoid version were evaluated. Results: The study included predominantly male patients (90%) with a mean age of 26.4 ± 6.4 years who underwent Latarjet procedures predominantly on the right side (60%). Significant associations were observed between thoracic morphology and alpha angle on postoperative CT scans. There was a significant positive correlation between anterior-posterior/transverse diameter ratio (AP/T) and alpha angle (r = 0.407, p < 0.001), as well as correlations between scapular inclination, glenoid version, thoracoscapular angle, and alpha angle (r = 0.275, p = 0.018; r = 0.241, p = 0.039; r = -0.288, p = 0.013, respectively). Patients were divided based on an alpha angle threshold of 15 degrees, with results indicating worse outcomes for angles above this threshold. Additionally, the AP/T ratio demonstrated predictive value for poor outcomes (AUC = 0.660, p = 0.018) with a threshold of 1.2545. Conclusions: This study highlights the direct impact of thoracic morphology on the alpha angle observed on post-Latarjet chest CT scans. Specifically, patients with a higher ratio of anterior-posterior to transverse thoracic diameter (AP/T) show a proportional increase in alpha angle. When the AP/T ratio exceeds 1.25, surgeons may face challenges in achieving the target alpha angle.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

The main objective was to assess the prognostic value of preoperative NLR for 5-year mortality. Additionally, we examined its relationship with perioperative clinicopathological features and 5-year major adverse limb events (MALEs). Results: During the study period, 200 consecutive patients underwent femoral endarterectomy. Of these, 128 patients with available NLR values within 30 days prior to surgery were analyzed. According to the receiver operating characteristic curve, the cut-off value of NLR was 4.0. Eighty-seven patients (68.0%) were assigned to the low-NLR group, and 41 patients (32.0%) to the high-NLR group. The frequency of postoperative complications did not differ significantly between the two groups. Freedom from MALEs up to five years was significantly lower in the high-NLR group (66.0% vs. 46.5%, p = 0.006). The overall survival rates were significantly lower in the high-NLR group (p < 0.001).

Univariate analysis showed that cerebrovascular disease, end-stage renal disease, Rutherford category ≥ 4, a low albumin concentration (<3.5 g/dL), and a high NLR were significantly associated with 5-year mortality. Multivariate analysis indicated that a high NLR was the only independent factor associated with 5-year mortality. Conclusions: Preoperative NLR > 4.0 was significantly associated with 5-year rates of MALE and mortality in patients with symptomatic CFA occlusive disease who underwent femoral endarterectomy.","2025","Journal of clinical medicine"

The 2-year locoregional recurrence rate was 52.6%, and the 2-year overall survival rate was 45.6%. About 66% of patients received concurrent chemotherapy. In total, we extracted 786 radiomic features from CT images and the Principal Component Analysis (PCA) method was used to screen out the maximum 30 features. Finally, the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method was used to construct the integrated prediction model combining radiomics and clinical features. In the five training groups for predicting locoregional recurrence, the mean value of C-index was 0.9841 (95%CI, 0.9809-0.9873), and in the five validation groups, the mean value was 0.744 (95%CI, 0.7437-0.7443). Conclusions: The integrated radiomics model could predict the 2-year locoregional recurrence after dCRT. The model showed promising results and could help guide treatment decisions by identifying high-risk patients and enabling strategies to prevent early recurrence.","2025","Cancers"

It is the primary cause of primary hypothyroidism and affects women more frequently than men. Nearly 95% of individuals with HT exhibit thyroid peroxidase antibodies or thyroglobulin antibodies. Dietary factors, including vitamins and trace elements such as zinc, play a significant role in thyroid health; yet, clinical guidelines lack explicit dietary recommendations for AIT. This study investigates the relationship between dietary zinc intake (Zinc) and AIT using data from the 2007-2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. A total of 5467 participants were analyzed, including 273 individuals with AIT and 5194 without AIT. Clinical characteristics, dietary Zinc, and other relevant variables were assessed. Multivariate logistic bidirectional stepwise regression analysis was conducted to identify independent risk factors for AIT, and a risk prediction model was developed. The prevalence of AIT was 5%. Individuals with AIT were older, had a higher proportion of females, and showed elevated levels of various biomarkers, including zinc. Dietary Zinc was significantly higher in the AIT group (22.6 mg vs. 15.3 mg, P < .001). The regression analysis identified dietary Zinc, along with other factors, as an independent risk factor for AIT. The risk prediction model, including zinc, demonstrated a better performance (area under the curve = 0.8) compared to the model without zinc. The findings indicate that higher dietary Zinc is positively correlated with the risk of AIT and serves as an independent risk factor. Excessive Zinc may disrupt immune balance, potentially increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases. These results suggest that dietary Zinc should be carefully considered in the management of AIT, and further research is needed to explore the causal relationship and determine safe zinc consumption levels to avoid increasing the risk of autoimmune diseases.","2025","Postgraduate medical journal"

Machine learning (ML) techniques are increasingly used in dementia research, e.g., for diagnosis and risk stratification. Less is known about the value of ML for predicting cognitive decline in people with dementia (PwD). The aim of this study was to use an ML approach to identify variables associated with a multimodal PA intervention that may impact cognitive changes in PwD, i.e., by distinguishing between cognitive decliners and non-decliners. This is a secondary, exploratory analysis using data from a Randomized Controlled Trial that included a 16-week multimodal PA intervention for the intervention group (IG) and treatment as usual for the control group (CG) in nursing homes. Predictors included in the ML models were related to the intervention (e.g., adherence), physical performance (e.g., mobility, balance), and pertinent health-related variables (e.g., health status, dementia form and severity). Primary outcomes were global and domain-specific cognitive performance (i.e., attention/ executive function, language, visuospatial skills, memory) assessed by standardized tests. A Support Vector Machine model was used to perform the classification of each primary outcome into the two classes of decline and non-decline. GridSearchCV with fivefold cross-validation was used for model training, and area under the ROC curve (AUC) and accuracy were calculated to assess model performance. The study sample consisted of 319 PwD (IG, N = 161; CG, N = 158). The proportion of PwD experiencing cognitive decline, in the different domains measured, ranged from 27-48% in CG, and from 23-49% in IG, with no statistically significant differences and no time*group effects. ML models showed accuracy and AUC values ranging from 40.6-75.6. The strongest predictors of cognitive decline or non-decline were performance of activities of daily living in IG and CG, and adherence and mobility in IG. ML models showed moderate performance, suggesting that the selected variables only had limited value for classification, with adherence and performance of activities of daily living appearing to be predictors of cognitive decline. While the study provides preliminary evidence of the potential use of ML approaches, larger studies are needed to confirm our observations and to include other variables in the prediction of cognitive decline, such as emotional health or biomarker abnormalities.","2025","European review of aging and physical activity : official journal of the European Group for Research into Elderly and Physical Activity"

Moreover, the association between the three nodal staging systems and survival was also explored. Clinical data on patients diagnosed with PDAC between 2004 and 2020 were downloaded from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database. Cox regression was performed to identify independent predictors of cancer specific survival (CSS) and overall survival (OS). Survival probability was calculated and compared by the Kaplan-Meier method and log rank test. Akaike information criterion (AIC) and Harrell's C-index were used to evaluate the prognostic ability of each nodal staging system. All three lymph node staging systems were independent predictors of CSS and OS. A higher NLN, a lower N stage, and a lower LNR were associated with improved survival. Compared with N stage, LNR staging performed better with a lower AIC and higher C-index for predicting the prognosis regardless of the sufficiency of retrieved lymph nodes, while NLN staging performed poorly in both the training and validation set. Subgroup analyses showed that the NLN successfully predicted survival outcomes in both lymph node-positive and node-negative patients. LNR demonstrated better predictive performance in PDAC patients regardless of the sufficiency of retrieved lymph nodes. Notably, for stage N0 disease, NLN was a more important prognostic predictor. The combination of LNR and NLN may offer more precise information on lymph node staging than the current staging system.","2025","Updates in surgery"

This retrospective cohort study included 82 patients suffering from aSAH. We evaluated the predictive efficacy of AtlasGPT and ChatGPT 4.0 by examining the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and Youden's Index, in comparison to established clinical grading scales such as the World Federation of Neurological Surgeons (WFNS) scale, Simplified Endovascular Brain Edema Score (SEBES), and Fisher scale. This assessment focused on four endpoints: in-hospital mortality, need for decompressive hemicraniectomy, and functional outcomes at discharge and after 6-month follow-up. In-hospital mortality occurred in 22% of the cohort, and 34.1% required decompressive hemicraniectomy during treatment. At hospital discharge, 28% of patients exhibited a favorable outcome (mRS ≤ 2), which improved to 46.9% at the 6-month follow-up. Prognostication utilizing the WFNS grading scale for 30-day in-hospital survival revealed an AUC of 0.72 with 59.4% sensitivity and 83.3% specificity. AtlasGPT provided the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC 0.80, 95% CI: 0.70-0.91) for predicting the need for decompressive hemicraniectomy, with 82.1% sensitivity and 77.8% specificity. Similarly, for discharge outcomes, the WFNS score and AtlasGPT demonstrated high prognostic values with AUCs of 0.74 and 0.75, respectively. Long-term functional outcome predictions were best indicated by the WFNS scale, with an AUC of 0.76. The study demonstrates the potential of integrating AI models such as AtlasGPT with clinical scales to enhance outcome prediction in aSAH patients. While established scales like WFNS remain reliable, AI language models show promise, particularly in predicting the necessity for surgical intervention and short-term functional outcomes. The study explored the use of advanced AI language models, AtlasGPT and ChatGPT 4.0, to predict outcomes for patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH). It found that AtlasGPT provided the highest diagnostic accuracy for predicting the need for decompressive hemicraniectomy, outperforming traditional clinical scales, while both AI models showed promise in enhancing outcome predictions when integrated with established clinical assessment tools.","2025","Neurosurgical review"

PubMed, Embase, Scopus, and Web of Science databases were systematically searched in English on human subjects for studies on distinguishing adenocarcinoma (ADC) from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) using PET radiomics published from inception until November 2024. The Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies 2 (QUADAS-2) tool and the Radiomics Quality Score (RQS) were utilized to assess the methodological quality of the included studies. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC) was pooled to estimate predictive performance. An overall effect size was estimated using a random-effects model. Statistical heterogeneity was evaluated by the I2 value. Subgroup analyses were conducted to explore sources of heterogeneity. Twelve studies were included in the analysis, yielding a pooled AUC of 0.92 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.89-0.94). Despite this promising result, the studies showed limitations in both study design and methodological quality, as evidenced by a median RQS of 11/36. A significant degree of heterogeneity was observed among the studies, with an I2 of 92.20% (95% CI: 89.01-95.39) for sensitivity and 89.29% (95% CI: 84.48-94.10) for specificity. This meta-analysis highlights the potential utility of PET radiomics in distinguishing ADC from SCC.

From June 2021 to July 2023, participants with pathologically confirmed BCa were prospectively recruited to undergo MRI examinations, including APTw and diffusion-weighted MRI before and after neoadjuvant immunochemotherapy. Histogram analysis features (mean, median, and entropy) were extracted from pre- and post-treatment APTw and apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps, respectively. Participants were categorized into pCR (pathological complete response, no residual tumor) and non-pCR groups based on histologic evaluation of post-treatment cystectomy specimens. The diagnostic efficacy of parameters in predicting tumor responsiveness was evaluated by calculating the area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Significant differences were found in several imaging biomarkers derived from pre-treatment APTw and diffusion-weighted MRI (P<0.05 for all). The baseline APTw mean values yielded the highest diagnostic performance, with an AUC of 0.85 (AUC: 0.75-0.93), for evaluating tumor responsiveness. For the pCR group, APTw values markedly decreased while ADC values noticeably increased at post-treatment MRI (P<0.05 for all). However, the parameter changes in non-pCR group were not significant (P>0.05 for all). MRI parametrics derived from APTw and diffusion-weighted MRI can both serve as valuable noninvasive imaging biomarkers for evaluating the efficacy of immunochemotherapy and may be used to guide personalized precision therapy.","2025","Academic radiology"

Adversarial attacks involve subtle, voxel-level manipulations of scans to increase deep-learning models' prediction errors. Testing deep-learning model performance on examples of adversarial images provides a measure of robustness, and including adversarial images in the training set can improve the model's robustness. In this study, we examined adversarial training and input modifications to improve the robustness of deep-learning models in predicting hematoma expansion (HE) from admission head CTs of patients with acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). We used a multicenter cohort of n=890 patients for cross-validation/training, and a cohort of n=684 consecutive ICH patients from two stroke centers for independent validation. Fast Gradient Sign Method (FGSM) and Projected Gradient Descent (PGD) adversarial attacks were applied for training and testing. We developed and tested four different models to predict ≥3mL, ≥6mL, ≥9mL, and ≥12mL HE in independent validation cohort applying Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Area Under the Curve (AUC). We examined varying mixtures of adversarial and non-perturbed (clean) scans for training as well as including additional input from the hyperparameter-free Otsu multi-threshold segmentation for model. When deep-learning models trained solely on clean scans were tested with PGD and FGSM adversarial images, the average HE prediction AUC dropped from 0.8 to 0.67 and 0.71, respectively. Overall, the best performing strategy to improve model robustness was training with 5-to-3 mix of clean and PGD adversarial scans and addition of Otsu multi-threshold segmentation to model input, increasing the average AUC to 0.77 against both PGD and FGSM adversarial attacks. Adversarial training with FGSM improved robustness against similar type attack but offered limited cross-attack robustness against PGD-type images. Adversarial training and inclusion of threshold-based segmentation as an additional input can improve deep-learning model robustness in prediction of HE from admission head CTs in acute ICH.

This multicenter retrospective study analyzed data from 181 patients with vertebrobasilar artery occlusion eligible for endovascular treatment from two Chinese stroke centers. We developed a predictive model for non-favorable clinical outcomes (modified Rankin Scale score >3) using the data of 125 patients from Stroke Center A (2019-2023). The model was constructed using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses of clinical and MRI characteristics, with continuous variables dichotomized based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Internal validation employed smooth bootstrapping, while external validation utilized 56 cases from Stroke Center B (2019-2023), ensuring model reliability and generalizability across diverse clinical settings. Age, NIHSS baseline score, recanalization, novel posterior circulation scores, and MRA-based posterior circulation collateral scores were independent predictors of 90-day prognosis, which were used to create a nomogram model. Internal validation demonstrated excellent discriminative performance of the model (mean area under the curve, 0.92 [95% CI: 0.91-0.93]), while external validation further confirmed its robust generalizability (area under the curve, 0.88).

A hierarchical clustering was performed using a factorial analysis of mixed data. To assess the clustering scheme, a machine-learning classification model was developed using the Extreme Gradient Boosting algorithm and subsequently ranked the variables for differentiating patient phenotypes. Of note, 3 clusters were identified using patient characteristics. The classification model demonstrated high performance (multiclass area under the curve = 0.921) in recognizing the clusters. The top 5 important variables in differentiating the clusters were sex (male/female), hemoglobin, albumin, creatinine, and high-density lipoprotein (all analysis of variance P <.001) in decreasing order of importance.

It further explores interactions between these biomarkers and the immune-infiltration environment, shedding light on how ferroptosis and lipid metabolism influence immune dynamics in MAFLD. Single-cell RNA sequencing data from liver samples were analyzed to evaluate expression variations related to ferroptosis and lipid metabolism in MAFLD patients. Gene scores were assessed to explore their impact on the immune microenvironment, particularly hepatocyte-macrophage communication. Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) was applied to Bulk-RNA-Seq data to identify gene clusters associated with ferroptosis and lipid metabolism. The analyses were integrated into a risk assessment system and predictive model, with validation conducted through in vivo experiments. Integration of single-cell and WGCNA data identified 11 key genes linked to ferroptosis and lipid metabolism (e.g., IER5L, SOCS2, KLF9), significantly influencing the liver's immune microenvironment. The risk assessment system and predictive model achieved an AUC of 0.92 and revealed distinct immune and biological characteristics in MAFLD patients across risk levels.

We compared performance estimates of a parametric empirical Bayes (PEB) algorithm, which incorporates participant biomarker history, to that of a single-threshold (ST) method. We demonstrated improvements in AUC estimates (2-13 %) for all biomarkers when considering the PEB approach compared to ST. For CA19-9, the PEBCA19-9 yielded an AUC of 0.88 when at least one repeat measurement was within 3 years of clinical diagnosis. At a specificity of 98.5 %, the PEBCA19-9 identified 15 of the 41 PDAC cases and signaled positive at an average lead-time of 1.09 years whereas the ST approach captured 11 of the 41 PDAC cases with an average positive signal at 0.48 years. Among CA19-9 low individuals, a PEB algorithm based on repeat measurements of TIMP1 yielded an additional 14 % sensitivity at 98.5 % specificity.

Candidate microRNAs were initially discovered through a global profiling of 798 serum microRNAs in five SPHS and seven non-SPHS patients, and then validated using real-time polymerase chain reactions in 168 patients. Pathways enriched from microRNA targets were compared to those from an integrated transcriptomic-proteomic analysis. Proteins pertaining to the key resulting pathway were measured to validate significance and reveal correlation with microRNA biomarkers. Serum microRNA profiling revealed a total of 81 significantly expressed microRNAs, of which seven were selected for further validation in the whole cohort of 168 leptospirosis patients, including 28 in SPHS and 140 nonSPHS groups. Among the selected microRNAs, miR-5010-3p and miR-147b-3p had significantly higher expression in SPHS group compared to nonSPHS group, with consistently higher expression after adjusting for age, sex, days of illness, comorbidity, smoking status or recruitment site. The two had area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.76 (95% CI: 0.67-0.85) and 0.70 (95% CI: 0.56-0.81) for discriminating SPHS, respectively. These microRNAs also exhibited consistent AUC values in patients tested before chest radiograph shadows manifested. Combination of miR-5010-3p with miR-548ai and miR-224-5p, as selected by Bayesian Model Averaging algorithm, substantially boosts the AUC value to 0.86 (95% CI: 0.77-0.94).

Biomarkers, as early predictive indicators of adverse outcomes, are lacking. To investigate whether post-rewarming cerebrospinal fluid (CSF)-neuro-specific enolase (NSE) levels after hypothermia are associated with neurodevelopmental outcomes at age six years, alone or when combined with amplitude-integrated electroencephalography (aEEG) and brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), as neuroimaging and neurophysiological indicators, respectively. We retrospectively enrolled 157 patients with HIE from 2011 to 2018 with available post-rewarming CSF-NSE levels and developmental tests at age six years. Of these, 148 met the inclusion criteria, and 87 were evaluated in the final analysis. Multivariate receiver operating characteristic analysis determined the predictive ability of post-rewarming CSF-NSE levels for adverse outcomes including death and cerebral palsy, intellectual disability, and borderline disability at age 6 years either singly or in combination with aEEG and MRI findings, using logistic regression analysis. The cut-off value for CSF-NSE at a median 5 days after birth was 233 ng/dL (area under the curve 0.97, 95 % confidence intervals of 0.93-1.00, sensitivity 1, specificity 0.94) for death. Regarding cerebral palsy and intellectual disability, the combination of abnormal aEEG at 72 h, moderate-severe MRI injury findings, and with or without CSF-NSE (cut-off value: 55 ng/mL), odds ratio (95 % confidence intervals) improving from 8.6 (2.7-27.8) to 12.4 (3.5-43.9) (p < 0.01).

The aim of this work was to determine how capnometry measurements, in the form of end-tidal CO2 (ETCO2) and the perfusion index (PI), could improve the National Early Warning Score (NEWS2). A secondary, prospective, multicenter, cohort study was undertaken in adult patients with unselected acute diseases who needed continuous monitoring in the emergency department (ED), involving two tertiary hospitals in Spain from October 1, 2022, to June 30, 2023. The primary outcome was 30-day all-cause in-hospital mortality. Demographics and vital signs necessary for NEWS2, ETCO2 and PI were collected. A total of 687 patients were included in the study. The median age was 79 years (IQR: 69-86), and 36.7 % were females, with an in-hospital mortality rate of 6.7 %. The NEWS2 score was 7 points for nonsurvivors and 4 points for survivors (p < 0.001). The EtCO2 levels were 30 mmHg (26-35) and 23  mmHg (16-30), and the PI levels were 4.7% (2.2-8.1) and 2.5 % (0.98-4.4) for survivors and nonsurvivors, respectively (both p < 0.001). The discrimination capacity of NEWS2 was AUC = 0.769 (95 % CI: 0.707-0.831), that of EtCO2 + PI was AUC = 0.737 (95 % CI: 0.66-0.814), and that of NEWS2 + ETCO2 + PI was AUC = 0.804 (95 % CI: 0.745-0.863). The present study findings indicate that the PI and ETCO2 improved the ability of the NEWS2 to predict 30-day in-hospital mortality. The novel association of the NEWS2 with the PI and ETCO2 should be considered since it could improve the identification of patients at risk of clinical worsening.","2025","The American journal of emergency medicine"

There is still limited data on how much resuscitated fluid and the specific ratios of intravenous fluid types contribute to the development of severe respiratory distress necessitating mechanical ventilation (MV) and AKI in children with DSS. This retrospective study was conducted at a tertiary pediatric hospital in Vietnam between 2013 and 2022. The primary outcomes were the need for MV and renal function within 48 h post-admission. A predictive model for MV was developed based on covariates from the first 24 h of PICU admission. Changes in renal function within 48 h were analyzed using a linear mixed-effects model. A total of 1,278 DSS children with complete clinical and fluid data were included. The predictive performance of MV based on the total intravenous fluid volume administered yielded an AUC of 0.871 (95% CI, 0.836-0.905), while the colloid-to-crystalloid ratio showed an AUC of 0.781 (95% CI, 0.743-0.819) (both P < 0.001). The optimal cut-off point of the cumulative fluid infusion was 181 mL/kg, whereas that of the colloid-to-crystalloid ratio was 1.6. Multivariable analysis identified female patients, severe bleeding, severe transaminitis, excessive fluid resuscitation, and a higher proportion of colloid solutions in the first 24 h as significant predictors of MV in DSS patients. The predictive model for MV demonstrated high accuracy, with a C-statistic of 89%, strong calibration, and low Brier score (0.04). Importantly, a more pronounced decline in glomerular filtration rate was observed in DSS patients who required MV than in those who did not. This study provides insights into optimizing fluid management protocols, highlighting the importance of monitoring fluid volume and the colloid-to-crystalloid ratio during early resuscitation to improve the clinical outcomes of DSS patients.","2025","PLoS neglected tropical diseases"

A risk score, predicting ICU admission within seven days of ER presentation, was developed using elastic net logistic regression on a northern German cohort (derivation cohort), evaluated on a southern German cohort (evaluation cohort) and externally validated on a Colombian cohort. Performance was evaluated through discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility against existing tools. ICU admission rates within seven days were 30.8% (derivation cohort, n=1295, median age 60, 38.1% female), 28.1% (evaluation cohort, n=1123, median age 58, 36.9% female), and 30.3% (Colombian cohort, n=780, median age 57, 38.8% female). The 11-point CROSS score, based on Confusion, Respiratory rate, Oxygen Saturation (with or without concurrent supplemental oxygen), and oxygen Supplementation, demonstrated good discrimination (area under the curve (AUC): 0.77 in the evaluation cohort; 0.69 in the Colombian cohort), good calibration, and superior clinical utility compared to existing tools. Mortality-predicting tools performed poorly in predicting ICU admission risk for patients with COVID-19. The calculator-free CROSS score effectively predicts ICU admission for patients with COVID-19 in the ER. Further studies are needed to assess its generalizability in other settings.

Ketamine has been widely used to treat MDD owing to its rapid effect in relieving depressive symptoms. Importantly, not all patients respond to ketamine treatment. Identifying sub-populations who will benefit from ketamine, as well as those who may not, prior to treatment initiation, would significantly advance precision medicine in patients with MDD. Here, we used mass spectrometry-based plasma proteomics to analyze matched pre- and post-ketamine treatment samples from a cohort of 30 MDD patients whose treatment outcomes and demographic and clinical characteristics were considered. Ketamine responders and non-responders were identified according to their individual outcomes after two weeks of treatment. We analyzed proteomic alterations in post-treatment samples from responders and non-responders and identified a collection of six proteins pivotal to the antidepressive effect of ketamine. Subsequent co-regulation analysis revealed that pathways related to immune response were involved in ketamine response. By comparing the proteomic profiles of samples from the same individuals at the pre- and post-treatment time points, dynamic proteomic rearrangements induced by ketamine revealed that immune-related processes were activated in association with its antidepressive effect. Furthermore, receiver operating characteristic curve analysis of pre-treatment samples revealed three proteins with strong predictive performance in determining the response of patients to ketamine before receiving treatment. These findings provide valuable knowledge about ketamine response, which will ultimately lead to more personalized and effective treatments for patients.

The objective of this study was to describe the use of ECMO and the associated outcomes in patients with PAIVS. We retrospectively reviewed neonates with PAIVS who received ECMO between 2009 and 2019 in 19 US hospitals affiliated with the Collaborative Research for the Pediatric Cardiac Intensive Care Society (CoRe-PCICS). Patients who received ECMO were compared to those who did not and patients on ECMO who died were compared to those who survived by bivariate analysis and multivariable logistic regression. The predictive ability of a risk score for inpatient mortality (using beta coefficients) was assessed by receiver operator curve analysis. Of 295 identified patients, 32 (11%) were supported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Of these, 15 (46%) experienced mortality. A higher left pulmonary artery z-score (beta coefficient 0.72) and the presence of ventriculocoronary connections by cardiac catheterization (beta coefficient 1.25) were associated with an increased risk of ECMO (p-value < 0.01). The resulting risk score had an area under the curve of 0.71 (p-value 0.03) for the prediction of need for ECMO. In a multicenter cohort of patients with PAIVS, 11% received ECMO.

The cutoff value, sensitivity, specificity, predictivity, and reproducibility of the ΔHUPV-NC and other visually assessed CT signs were analyzed and compared using the receiver-operating characteristic curve, multivariable regression, and inter-rater agreement assays, respectively. Women with twisted (n = 73 [47 ± 19 years]) or untwisted (n = 92 [40 ± 15 years]) adnexal lesions were reviewed.

There is no technique approved as a gold standard procedure for reducing excessive kidney mobility. The study aimed to uncover predictive factors for determining excessive renal mobility by utilizing clinicodemographic characteristics and noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT) data. Materials and Methods: The patients were categorized into two groups based on the presence of excessive renal mobility. Patients were scanned with a 16-channel, multislice NCCT, and images were captured utilizing a 16 × 1.25 mm collimation, 5 mm slice thickness. Many parameters including the origin angle of the renal artery, renal artery, vein length, diameter, the area and length of the psoas muscle, and perirenal and pararenal fatty tissue were measured on the images and analyzed. The data were analyzed using multivariate logistic regression, and the receiver operating characteristic curve model and we used predictive modeling based on three significant parameters. Results: Between May 2023 and May 2024, a total of 140 patients with and without excessive renal mobility enrolled into study. After multivariate analysis, increasing renal vein length and renal artery origin angle results in higher renal motility (odds ratio [OR]: 0.982; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.966-0.998; p = 0.030 and OR: 0.973; 95% CI: 0.948-0.999; p = 0.044; respectively). It also observed that an increase in tidal volume led to a reduction in renal mobility (OR: 1.015; 95% CI: 1.007-1.024; p = 0.001). Predictive modeling was designed based on these outcomes. This predictive modeling accurately estimates the presence of excessive renal mobility with improved 59% specificity and 65% sensitivity (p < 0.001, area under the curve 0.757; CI: 0.671-0.843).

In this study, we aimed to integrate different types of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), providing structural and functional information, and develop a robust machine learning model that classifies migraine patients from healthy controls by testing multiple combinations of hyperparameters to ensure stability across different migraine phases and longitudinally repeated data. Specifically, we constructed a diagnostic model to classify patients with episodic migraine from healthy controls, and validated its performance across ictal and interictal phases, as well as in a longitudinal setting. We obtained T1-weighted and resting-state functional MRI data from 50 patients with episodic migraine and 50 age- and sex-matched healthy controls, with follow-up data collected after one year. Morphological features, including cortical thickness, curvature, and sulcal depth, and functional connectivity features, such as low-dimensional representation of functional connectivity (gradient), degree centrality, and betweenness centrality, were utilized. We employed a regularization-based feature selection method combined with a random forest classifier to construct a diagnostic model. By testing the models with varying feature combinations, penalty terms, and spatial granularities within a strict cross-validation framework, we found that the combination of curvature, sulcal depth, cortical thickness, and functional gradient achieved a robust classification performance. The model performance was assessed using the test dataset and achieved 87% accuracy and 0.94 area under the curve (AUC) at distinguishing migraine patients from healthy controls, with 85%, 0.97 and 84%, 0.93 during the interictal and ictal/peri-ictal phases, respectively.

Additionally, Spearman's analysis was used to examine the association between ADC histogram parameters and CD8+ T cells. The level of tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells was found to have a negative correlation with recurrence in patients with meningiomas (r=-0.235, p = 0.031). No statistically significant differences were found in clinical and conventional MRI features between the two groups (all p > 0.05). Conversely, among the ADC histogram parameters, the coefficient of variation (CV), Perc.01, Perc.05, Perc.10, and Perc.25 showed statistically significant differences between the two groups (all p < 0.05) and combined ADC histogram parameters had the highest AUC (0.791; 95%CI (0.689-0.872)). Additionally, we observed a positive correlation between Perc.01, Perc.05, Perc.10 and CD8+ T cells (p < 0.05), the CV and variance was negatively correlated with the levels of CD8+ T cells (p < 0.05). ADC histogram analysis can be used as an imaging tool to preoperatively assess CD8+ T cells in patients with meningioma, and found a certain correlation between them.","2025","Neurosurgical review"

Current TDV screening protocols perform poorly and are rarely implemented, but recent research and policy emphasizes the importance of leveraging more trauma-focused screening measures for improved prevention outcomes. In response, the present study examined which adversities (i.e., indices of family violence), trauma-focused risk factors (i.e., threat and reward biases) and strengths (i.e., social support and racial/ethnic identity) best classified concurrent and prospective risk for physical and psychological forms of TDV-perpetration. Participants included 584 adolescents aged 12-18 years (MAge = 14.43; SD = 1.22), evenly distributed across gender (48.9% female), race (35% African American; 38.5% White) and ethnicity (40% Hispanic). Surveys completed at baseline and 1-year follow-up were analyzed using an evidence-based medicine (EBM) analytic protocol (i.e., logistic regression, area-under-the-curve; (AUC), diagnostic likelihood ratios (DLR), calibration curves) and compared to machine learning models. Results revealed hostility best classified risk for concurrent and prospective physical TDV-perpetration (AUCs > 0.70; DLRs > 2.0). Additionally, domestic violence (DV) exposure best forecasted prospective psychological TDV-perpetration (AUC > 0.70; DLR > 3.0). Both indices were well-calibrated (i.e., non-significant Spiegelhalter's Z statistics) and statistically fair. Machine learning models added minimal incremental validity. Results demonstrate the importance of prioritizing hostility and DV-exposure for accurate, equitable, and feasible screening for physical and psychological forms of TDV-perpetration, respectively. Integrating these findings into existing prevention protocols can lead to a more targeted approach to reducing TDV-perpetration.","2025","Prevention science : the official journal of the Society for Prevention Research"

A retrospective cohort of 249 patients (498 eyes) diagnosed with NPDR was analysed. Structural OCT scans were obtained using the Heidelberg Spectralis HRA + OCT device. Manual segmentation of MAs was performed by five masked readers, with an expert grader ensuring consistent labeling. Two deep learning models, YOLO (You Only Look Once) and DETR (DEtection TRansformer), were trained using the annotated OCT images. Detection and classification performance were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The YOLO model performed poorly with an AUC of 0.35 for overall MA detection, with AUCs of 0.33 and 0.24 for hyperreflective and hyporeflective MAs, respectively. The DETR model had an AUC of 0.86 for overall MA detection, but AUCs of 0.71 and 0.84 for hyperreflective and hyporeflective MAs, respectively. Post-hoc review revealed that discrepancies between automated and manual grading were often due to the automated method's selection of normal retinal vessels. The choice of deep learning model is critical to achieving accuracy in detecting and classifying MAs in structural OCT images. An automated approach may assist clinicians in the early detection and monitoring of diabetic retinopathy, potentially improving patient outcomes.","2025","Eye (London, England)"

Prior neuroimaging research has demonstrated that individuals with stroke present structural and functional brain abnormalities, evident through disruptions in motor, cognitive, and other vital functions. Nevertheless, there is a lack of studies on alterations in static and dynamic functional network connectivity in the brains of stroke patients. Fifty stroke patients and 50 healthy controls (HCs) underwent resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) scanning. Initially, the independent component analysis (ICA) method was utilized to extract the resting-state network (RSN). Subsequently, the disparities in static functional network connectivity both within and between networks among the two groups were computed and juxtaposed. Following this, five consistent and robust dynamic functional network connectivity (dFNC) states were derived by integrating the sliding time window method with k-means cluster analysis, and the distinctions in dFNC between the groups across different states, along with the intergroup variations in three dynamic temporal metrics, were assessed. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) approach was employed to discriminate stroke patients from HCs using FC and FNC as classification features. Comparing the stroke group to the healthy control (HC) group, the stroke group exhibited reduced intra-network functional connectivity (FC) in the right superior temporal gyrus of the ventral attention network (VAN), the left calcarine of the visual network (VN), and the left precuneus of the default mode network (DMN). Regarding static functional network connectivity (FNC), we identified increased connectivity between the executive control network (ECN) and dorsal attention network (DAN), salience network (SN) and DMN, SN-ECN, and VN-ECN, along with decreased connectivity between DAN-DAN, ECN-SN, SN-SN, and DAN-VN between the two groups. Noteworthy differences in dynamic FNC (dFNC) were observed between the groups in states 3 to 5. Moreover, stroke patients demonstrated a significantly higher proportion of time and longer mean dwell time in state 4, alongside a decreased proportion of time in state 5 compared to HC. Finally, utilizing FC and FNC as features, stroke patients could be distinguished from HC with an accuracy exceeding 70% and an area under the curve ranging from 0.8284 to 0.9364. In conclusion, our study reveals static and dynamic changes in large-scale brain networks in stroke patients, potentially linked to abnormalities in visual, cognitive, and motor functions. This investigation offers valuable insights into the neural mechanisms underpinning the functional deficits observed in stroke, thereby aiding in the diagnosis and development of targeted therapeutic interventions for affected individuals.","2025","Brain topography"

The Swedish tree pollen season starts in February with alder and hazel pollination, followed by birch and ends with oak in May. Systemic corticosteroids are often prescribed when topical treatments fail, despite limited evidence supporting their efficacy. To compare the effectiveness of prednisolone tablets versus antihistamine tablets in reducing symptoms and medication usage in patients with moderate to severe tree pollen-induced AR. This interventional single-center, double-blinded randomized trial included 34 patients. Treatment was initiated, and symptoms were registered during the tree pollen season. The two groups received either prednisolone tablets (20 mg) or ebastine tablets (20 mg) for 7 days. Treatment effects were evaluated by comparing daily symptom scores, use of topical medication, and a combined symptom-medical score between the groups. Quality of life was recorded at the start and after 3 weeks. Both interventions demonstrated efficacy in enhancing quality of life metrics. The area under the curve (AUC) for the combined symptom severity and medication usage score averaged 34.0 (SD = 19.1, 95% CI = 24.5-43.4) in the group treated with prednisolone. This was marginally lower than the control group, with an AUC of 32.6 (SD = 13.2, 95% CI = 25.6-39.7). The difference was not statistically significant (p = 0.80). Both groups exhibited only mild adverse events, which were statistically comparable in frequency and severity. Prednisolone tablets did not show superior efficacy over antihistamine tablets in reducing symptoms or medication usage in tree pollen-induced AR. These results suggest that systemic corticosteroids may not provide additional benefits over antihistamines, and clinicians should prioritize individualized treatment based on patient preferences and tolerability.","2025","Clinical and translational allergy"

Liver fibrosis is a long-term complication of GD, potentially leading to cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. There are currently no validated clinical tools for the monitoring of liver fibrosis in patients with GD. In this study, we aim at assessing the validity of common fibrosis-predicting scores, developed for other diseases, for the use in GD, using transient elastography as a gold-standard, as well as developing the first GD-specific liver fibrosis predicting score. We enrolled 19 adult patients with GD who had been on treatment for a minimum of 1 year on enzyme replacement therapy or substrate reduction therapy and who had no evidence of any other liver disease except GD or metabolic-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD), which is a common comorbidity of GD. We analyzed the correlation between liver stiffness and genotype, treatment modality (imiglucerase or other therapies), clinical severity, and clinical laboratory tests. We found that the common liver fibrosis scores APRI, FIB-4, and NFS did not accurately predict liver fibrosis in people with GD. We also found that male sex, the DS3 score, AST, and GGT levels significantly correlated with liver stiffness, and used these to create a simple but accurate fibrosis-predicting score specifically for GD (the ""Gaucher liver fibrosis score"", or GLFS), with high accuracy (AUC = 0.8571, p = 0.0206). We believe that our new GLFS may be used in clinical practice to help prioritize GD patients for closer monitoring of liver fibrosis.","2025","Molecular genetics and metabolism"

Ki67 expression was determined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and categorized into low (<15%) and high (≥15%) expression groups. Radiomics features were extracted from segmented tumor regions in the corticomedullary phase (CMP) CT images using the ""PyRadiomics"" package. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression was applied to select the most relevant radiomics features for Ki-67 expression, which were then used to train five ML models. Models' performances were evaluated via the receiving operator curve analysis and compared using Delong test. Calibration and decision curve analyses assessed the models' clinical utility. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Log-rank tests were conducted to determine the prognostic value of radiomics-predicted Ki-67 expression status. The optimal model was interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Eight radiomics feature were selected to build models using Random forest (RF), eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Logistic regression (LR), Support vector machine (SVM), and K-nearest neighbor (KNN). The RF model exhibited the best performance, achieving the highest area under the curve (AUC) in both the training (0.910, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.881-0.936) and external test (0.885, 95% CI: 0.826-0.934) sets, as confirmed by Delong test (all P values＜0.05). Calibration and decision curves further demonstrated the superior clinical utility of the RF model. Both IHC-based and RF-predicted high Ki-67 expression groups were significantly associated with a higher risk of tumor recurrence in the training and external test sets (all P values＜0.05). The prediction process of the RF model was uncovered in the globe and individualized terms using the SHAP.

Early diagnosis is essential to control transmission and effectively treat the disease. Quantitative thermal testing (QTT) has been proposed as a valuable tool for early detection of the disease, initiation of treatment, and monitoring of nerve damage. A thermal analyser was used to determine warm and cold perception thresholds (WPT and CPT, respectively) in skin lesions of 42 leprosy patients and 22 healthy controls. The thresholds were determined using a 0.25 cm2 thermal stimulator, the method of limits, and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. Thermal thresholds were higher in patients' skin lesions compared to unaffected areas and controls. The reference points calculated for the WPT and CPT were 36.55 and 26.35°C, respectively, with high sensitivity and specificity. The nerve fibres affected by leprosy caused altered thermal sensitivity in the patients' lesions, especially in warm sensation.

The diagnosis of indeterminate brain lesions on MRI often requires tissue confirmation via brain biopsy. Noninvasive methods for accurate diagnosis of tumor and non-tumor etiologies allows for tailored therapy, optimal tumor control, and a reduced risk of iatrogenic morbidity and mortality. Tumefactive demyelination has imaging features that mimic isocitrate dehydrogenase-wildtype glioblastoma (IDHwt GBM). We hypothesized that deep learning applied to postcontrast T1-weighted (T1C) and T2-weighted (T2) MRI images can discriminate tumefactive demyelination from IDHwt GBM. Patients with tumefactive demyelination (n=144) and IDHwt GBM (n=455) were identified by clinical registries. A 3D DenseNet121 architecture was used to develop models to differentiate tumefactive demyelination and IDHwt GBM using both T1C and T2 MRI images, as well as only T1C and only T2 images. A three-stage design was used: (i) model development and internal validation via five-fold cross validation using a sex-, age-, and MRI technology-matched set of tumefactive demyelination and IDHwt GBM, (ii) validation of model specificity on independent IDHwt GBM, and (iii) prospective validation on tumefactive demyelination and IDHwt GBM. Stratified AUCs were used to evaluate model performance stratified by sex, age at diagnosis, MRI scanner strength, and MRI acquisition. The deep learning model developed using both T1C and T2 images had a prospective validation area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC) of 88% (95% CI: 0.82 - 0.95). In the prospective validation stage, a model score threshold of 0.28 resulted in 91% sensitivity of correctly classifying tumefactive demyelination and 80% specificity (correctly classifying IDHwt GBM). Stratified AUCs demonstrated that model performance may be improved if thresholds were chosen stratified by age and MRI acquisition. MRI images can provide the basis for applying deep learning models to aid in the differential diagnosis of brain lesions. Further validation is needed to evaluate how well the model generalizes across institutions, patient populations, and technology, and to evaluate optimal thresholds for classification. Next steps also should incorporate additional tumor etiologies such as CNS lymphoma and brain metastases.

This study aims to explore how postprocedure ankle-brachial index (ABI) influences outcomes following DCB treatment for FPA disease. This study included patients in a multicenter registry (K-VIS ELLA) treated with DCB for FPA disease between January 2006 and August 2021. Optimal postprocedure ABI cutoff for predicting clinically driven target lesion revascularization (TLR) was determined using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Independent predictors of TLR were identified using multivariable Cox regression analysis. A total of 654 limbs (514 patients) treated with DCB for FPA were evaluated by ABI at 1-day (median, interquartile range, 1 to 2 days) postprocedure and followed up for a median of 370 days. The optimal immediate postprocedure ABI cutoff value for predicting TLR was 0.72 (area under the curve, 0.68). Significantly improved TLR-free and major adverse limb event-free survival rates were observed with a postprocedure ABI ≥ 0.72 (hazard ratio [HR] = 0.24, 95% confidence intervals [CI] = 0.16 to 0.37, p < 0.001; HR = 0.25, 95% CI = 0.16 to 0.38, p < 0.001, respectively).

Cachexia was retrospectively diagnosed using Fearon's framework. PRCC was defined as a diagnosis of cancer cachexia at baseline that turned negative 1 mo later. Body weight dynamics accessible upon patient admission were screened and modeled to predict PRCC. Multiple ML models were trained and cross-validated using 70% of the data to predict PRCC, with the remaining 30% reserved for model evaluation. The interpretability and clinical usefulness of the optimal model were assessed, and external validation was performed in an independent cohort of 238 patients. The study enrolled 1983 men and 1784 women (median age = 58 y). PRCC was identified in 1983 patients (52.6%). Breast cancer exhibited the highest rate of PRCC (72.1%), whereas cachexia associated with various gastrointestinal cancers was less likely to be reversed. Weight change (WC) from 6 mo ago to 1 mo ago, WC from 1 mo ago to baseline (-1 to 0), and baseline body mass index were selected for modeling. A multilayer perceptron model showed good performance to predict PRCC in the holdout test set [area under the curve (95% confidence interval): 0.887 (0.866, 0.907); accuracy: 0.836; sensitivity: 0.859; specificity: 0.812] and the external validation set [area under the curve (95% confidence interval): 0.863 (0.778, 0.948)].

Accordingly, time to diagnosis represents one of the greatest unmet needs in HS, which to date has not been adequately addressed. A general lack of awareness about HS in the medical community and a notable heterogeneity in clinical presentation, which is most often confused with cutaneous abscess (CA), forms the basis of poor disease recognition and diagnosis delay. Our objective was to develop and validate a prediction model for diagnosis of HS versus site-specific CA. We performed a cross-sectional study in which the model was developed using a large clinical database and externally validated using a sample of clinical records at Penn State Health. Prediction model discrimination and calibration were evaluated using the c-statistic, calibration intercept/slope, and a flexible calibration curve. Variable selection identified 15 predictors, 7 of which remained after model simplification. The following characteristics were predictive of HS relative to site-specific CA: female sex, increasing age up to 44 years, African American race, race other than white or African American, increasing body mass index, polycystic ovarian syndrome, and acne. The c-statistic of the 7-variable model in validation was 0.77 (95% CI: 0.73-0.80). Calibration intercept and slope were 0.29 (95% CI: 0.14, 0.43) and 1.09 (95% CI: 0.90, 1.28).

While Doxil enhances the pharmacokinetics and reduces the cardiotoxicity of DOX solution (DOX sol), it shows limitations of low drug loading capacity and inadequate cellular uptake. To overcome these issues, this study developed a novel disulfide bond-linked DOX-maleimide prodrug (DSSM). DSSM could self-assemble into nanoparticles (NPs) with a high drug loading capacity (58.89 %, w/w). DSSM could rapidly bind to endogenous albumin through the maleimide group. Compared to DOX sol, DSSM had increased area under the curve (AUC) by approximately 60-fold, and similarly, quadrupled tumor accumulation after 4 h of administration, achieving efficient tumor targeting. With only 5 % DSPE-mPEG2K, the cellular uptake of DSSM NPs was better than Doxil. Furthermore, the high reduction sensitivity of the disulfide bond enabled bio-activation of DSSM at the tumor site, while maintaining stability in normal cells. Compared with DOX sol and Doxil, DSSM NPs significantly improved safety and demonstrated better anti-tumor effect at tolerated doses. Our findings present a promising strategy for achieving effective tumor targeting and bio-activation, addressing key limitations of current DOX nanoformulations.","2025","Journal of colloid and interface science"

Due to those conditions, close monitoring is necessary and therefore, a large volume of data is collected. Collaborative ventures have enabled the emergence of large open access databases, leading to numerous publications in the field. The aim of this scoping review is to identify the characteristics of studies using open access intensive care databases and to describe the contribution of these studies to intensive care research. The research was conducted using 3 databases (PubMed-MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science) from the inception of each database to August 1, 2022. We included original articles based on 4 open databases of patients admitted to ICUs: Amsterdam University Medical Centers Database, eICU Collaborative Research Database, High time resolution ICU dataset, Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care (II to IV). A double-blinded screening for eligibility was performed, first on the title and abstract and subsequently on the full-text articles. Characteristics relating to publication journals, study design, and statistical analyses were extracted and analyzed. We observed a consistent increase in the number of publications from these databases since 2016. The Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care databases were the most frequently used. The highest contributions came from China and the United States, with 689 (52.7%) and 370 (28.3%) publications respectively. The median impact factor of publications was 3.8 (IQR 2.8-5.8). Topics related to cardiovascular and infectious diseases were predominant, accounting for 333 (25.5%) and 324 (24.8%) articles, respectively. Logistic regression emerged as the most commonly used statistical model for both inference and prediction questions, featuring in 396 (55.5%) and 281 (47.5%) studies, respectively. A majority of the inference studies yielded statistically significant results (84.0%). In prediction studies, area under the curve was the most frequent performance measure, with a median value of 0.840 (IQR 0.780-0.890). The abundance of scientific outputs resulting from these databases, coupled with the diversity of topics addressed, highlight the importance of these databases as valuable resources for clinical research. This suggests their potential impact on clinical practice within intensive care settings. However, the quality and clinical relevance of these studies remains highly heterogeneous, with a majority of articles being published in low-impact factor journals.","2025","Journal of medical Internet research"

We sought to determine whether internal EEG subparameters extracted by the Bispectral Index (BIS) monitor, a device commonly used to estimate depth-of-anesthesia intraoperatively, could be repurposed to predict recovery of consciousness after cardiac arrest. In this retrospective cohort study, we trained a 3-layer neural network to predict recovery of consciousness to the point of command following versus not based on 48 hours of continuous EEG recordings in 315 comatose patients admitted to a single US academic medical center after cardiac arrest (Derivation cohort: N=181; Validation cohort: N=134). Continuous EEGs were partially processed into subparameters using virtualized emulation of the BIS Engine (i.e., the internal software of the BIS monitor) applied to signals from the frontotemporal leads of the standard 10-20 EEG montage. Our model was trained on hourly-averaged measurements of these internal subparameters. We compared this model's performance to the modified Westhall qualitative EEG scoring framework. Maximum prognostic accuracy in the Derivation Cohort was achieved using a network trained on only four BIS subparameters (inverse burst suppression ratio, mean spectral power density, gamma power, and theta/delta power). In a held-out sample of 134 patients, our model outperformed current state-of-the-art qualitative EEG assessment techniques at predicting recovery of consciousness (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve: 0.86, accuracy: 0.87, sensitivity: 0.83, specificity: 0.88, positive predictive value: 0.71, negative predictive value: 0.94). Gamma band power has not been previously reported as a correlate of recovery potential after cardiac arrest. In patients comatose after cardiac arrest, four EEG features calculated internally by the BIS Engine were repurposed by a compact neural network to achieve a prognostic accuracy superior to the current clinical qualitative gold-standard, with high sensitivity for recovery. These features hold promise for assessing patients after cardiac arrest.","2025","Anesthesiology"

We created a prognostic signature with three dysregulated DESRGs (CDC25B, FKBP5, and ECHDC3) and two clinical variables (serum creatinine, Gensini score). The signature stratified patients into low- and high-risk groups and showed strong predictive performance within two years. The external validation confirmed the survival difference between the groups. We identified three DESRGs that were differentially expressed and prognostic in STEMI patients.

Therefore, the objective of this study was to explore the correlation between DTV and survival in patients with HCC after curative hepatic resection. Consecutive patients who underwent curative-intent liver surgery for HCC between April 2018 and May 2023 were identified from a prospective database. Univariate and multivariate Cox regression analysis were performed to identify independent predictors of recurrence-free survival (RFS). A ROC-curve was used to find the optimal cut-off value for DTV. According to the estimated cut-off value, patients were divided into 2 subgroups, then using the Kaplan-Meier survival curve, RFS and overall survival (OS) were estimated and compared between the 2 subgroups. In univariate analysis, DTV, tumor size, resection margins, microvascular invasion (MVI) and tumor grading were associated with RFS. In multivariate analysis, DTV, tumor size, and MVI were confirmed as independent predictors of RFS. In the ROC-analysis the optimal cutoff value of DTV was 20 mm. Patients with a DTV < 20 mm had a larger tumor size and a more advanced histopathological grading. There was no difference in the presence of MVI in both groups, while a significantly more patients experienced recurrence after hepatectomy in the DTV < 20 mm group. Accordingly, patients with a DTV < 20 mm experienced a shorter median RFS and OS. DTV is a promising predictor of RFS and OS in HCC.","2025","Langenbeck's archives of surgery"

All 344 patients (51 ± 15 years, 171 men) in a first episode of acute pancreatitis (AP) were retrospectively enrolled and randomly divided into training (n = 206), validation (n = 69), and test (n = 69) sets with the ratio of 6:2:2. The patients were dichotomized into good and poor prognosis subgroups based on follow-up CT and clinical data. The radiomics features were extracted from contrast-enhanced CT. Logistic regression analysis was applied to analyze clinical-radiological features for developing clinical and radiomics-derived models. The predictive performance of each model was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curve, and decision curve analysis (DCA). Eight pancreatic and six peripancreatic radiomics features were identified after reduction and selection. In the training set, the AUCs of clinical, pancreatic, peripancreatic, radiomics, and combined models were 0.859, 0.800, 0.823, 0.852, and 0.899, respectively. In the validation set, the AUCs were 0.848, 0.720, 0.746, 0.773, and 0.877, respectively. The combined model exhibited the highest AUC among radiomics-based models (pancreatic, peripancreatic, and radiomics models) in both the training (0.899) and validation (0.877) sets (all p < 0.05). Further, the AUC of the combined model was 0.735 in the test set. The calibration curve and DCA indicated the combined model had favorable predictive performance. CT-based radiomics incorporating clinical features was superior to other models in predicting AP prognosis, which may offer additional information for AP patients at higher risk of developing poor prognosis. Integrating CT radiomics-based analysis of pancreatic and peripancreatic features with clinical risk factors enhances the assessment of AP prognosis, allowing for optimal clinical decision-making in individuals at risk of severe AP. Radiomics analysis provides help to accurately assess acute pancreatitis (AP). CT radiomics-based models are superior to the clinical model in the prediction of AP prognosis.

Eight research teams submitted a total of 30 models to predict phenotypes based on the sequences of 74 genes (VCF format) in 415 pediatric patients affected by Neurodevelopmental Disorders (NDDs). NDDs are clinically and genetically heterogeneous conditions, with onset in infant age. Here, we assess the ability and accuracy of computational methods to predict comorbid phenotypes based on clinical features described in each patient and their causal variants. We also evaluated predictions for possible genetic causes in patients without a clear genetic diagnosis. Like the previous ID Panel challenge in CAGI5, seven clinical features (ID, ASD, ataxia, epilepsy, microcephaly, macrocephaly, hypotonia), and variants (Pathogenic/Likely Pathogenic, Variants of Uncertain Significance and Risk Factors) were provided. The phenotypic traits and variant data of 150 patients from the CAGI5 ID Panel Challenge were provided as training set for predictors. The CAGI6 challenge confirms CAGI5 results that predicting phenotypes from gene panel data is highly challenging, with AUC values close to random, and no method able to predict relevant variants with both high accuracy and precision. However, a significant improvement is noted for the best method, with recall increasing from 66% to 82%.

Therefore, an investigation into the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of DBT screening while optimising reading is required. The Screening Tomosynthesis trial with advanced REAding Methods (STREAM) aims to include 17,275 women (age 50-72 years) eligible for breast cancer screening in the Netherlands for two biennial DBT screening rounds to determine the short-, medium-, and long-term effects and acceptability of DBT screening and identify an optimised strategy for reading DBT. The control group will consist of 86,400 women selected from the database of the Dutch breast cancer screening programme screened with digital mammography. The intervention group will undergo DBT examinations only. Four different reading strategies will be evaluated on a subset of first-round screening exams. These four strategies will also be evaluated combined with replacing one of the two readers with AI predictions. The Microsimulation Screening Analysis (MISCAN)-Breast model will be used to estimate the long-term outcomes of DBT screening assuming the best-performing reading method. The primary outcome measure is the IC and advanced cancer rate at the second round (combined endpoint) in the DBT group compared to the control group. Secondary outcome measures are participation, recall and detection rates, positive predictive value, acceptability, reading method with the best case-based area under the curve and reading time, predicted breast cancer mortality, number of cancers overdiagnosed, and cost-effectiveness.

One-hundred four patients with CI-CVD and 107 control subjects were retrospectively recruited from the 14-year elderly MRA cohort, and 63 subjects were enrolled for external validation. Automated quantitative analysis was applied to analyse the morphological features, including the stenosis score, length, relative length, twisted angle, and maximum deviation of cerebral arteries. Clinical and morphological risk factors were screened using univariate logistic regression. Radiomic features were extracted via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression. The predictive models of CI-CVD were established in the training set and verified in the external testing set. A history of stroke was demonstrated to be a clinical risk factor (OR 2.796, 1.359-5.751). Stenosis ≥ 50% in the right middle cerebral artery (RMCA) and left posterior cerebral artery (LPCA), maximum deviation of the left internal carotid artery (LICA), and twisted angles of the right internal carotid artery (RICA) and LICA were identified as morphological risk factors, with ORs of 4.522 (1.237-16.523), 2.851 (1.438-5.652), 1.373 (1.136-1.661), 0.981 (0.966-0.997) and 0.976 (0.958-0.994), respectively.

Descriptive statistics helped to conclude that all of the samples were inside the permitted limit of WHO for pH, Ca, Mg, Turbidity, Cl, K, Na, SO4, NO3, F and beyond limit of WHO for EC, HCO3, TDS, and As. RF suggested a median drop in Gini node impurity across all tree divisions. This predicted As contamination in samples due to presence of TDS, EC, HCO3- and turbidity in upper end of graph which expressed significance of these factors in contaminating water with Arsenic. Moreover, these factors were found positively correlated with Ar contamination. LR model expressed about best fitness of model. ANN classified large data set into two classes i.e. (1) Inside limit of WHO and (2) and outside limit of WHO. Total dissolved solids (TDS), turbidity, sodium (Na) and electrical conductivity (EC) were positively correlated with Ar (Arsenic concentration) in the collected samples. pH and K were negatively associated with Arsenic concentration of the observed samples. Confusion matrices and ROC-AUC scores evaluated that RF, model outperforming than LR, and ANN, in accuracy and sensitivity. Key variables influencing As concentration in the groundwater resources of the study area were identified, such parameters include TDS, chloride (Cl), bicarbonate (HCO3-) and turbidity.

This study systematically reviewed and analyzed PSCI prediction models, identifying the associated risk factors. We systematically retrieved literature from PubMed, Cochrane Library, Embase, and other sources. Two researchers independently extracted the literature and assessed the risk of bias using the Critical Appraisal and Data Extraction for Systematic Reviews of Prediction Modelling Studies (CHARMS) checklist and The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool (PROBAST).

The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) value for the development models ranged from 0.66 to 0.969, while the validation models ranged from 0.763 to 0.893. Age, diabetes, hypersensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), hypertension, and homocysteine (hcy) were identified as the strongest predictors. In this systematic review, several PSCI prediction models demonstrate promising prediction performance, although they often lack external validation and exhibit high heterogeneity in some predictive factors. Therefore, we recommend that medical practitioners utilize a comprehensive set of predictive factors to screen for high-risk PSCI patients.

A total of 2238 adult patients with a diagnosis of ischemic stroke, admitted to the ICU for the first time, were included from the MIMIC-IV database. The outcome of interest was the development of sepsis. Model development adhered to the TRIPOD guidelines. Feature selection was performed using Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression, identifying 28 key variables. Multiple machine learning algorithms, including logistic regression, k-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, decision trees, and XGBoost, were trained and internally validated. Performance metrics were assessed, and XGBoost was selected as the optimal model. The SHAP method was used to interpret the XGBoost model, revealing the impact of individual features on predictions. The model was also deployed on a user-friendly platform for practical use in clinical settings. The XGBoost model demonstrated superior performance in the validation set, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.863 and offering greater net benefit compared to other models. SHAP analysis identified key factors influencing sepsis risk, including the use of invasive mechanical ventilation on the first day, excessive body weight, a Glasgow Coma Scale verbal score below 3, age, and elevated body temperature (>37.5 °C). A user interface had been developed to enable clinicians to easily access and utilize the model. This study developed the first machine learning-based model to predict sepsis in ischemic stroke patients. The model exhibited high accuracy and holds potential as a clinical decision support tool, enabling earlier identification of high-risk patients and facilitating preventive measures to reduce sepsis incidence and mortality in this population.","2025","Journal of intensive care medicine"

Women are disproportionately affected by migraines, with a higher prevalence and more severe symptoms compared to men. This study investigated the effects of cortical spreading depression on light-aversive and dark-seeking behaviors in a rat model, with an emphasis on sex differences. Experiments were conducted on seven to eight-week-old male and female Sprague Dawley rats. cortical spreading depression was modeled by injections of potassium chloride or artificial cerebrospinal fluid into the occipital cortex through a guide cannula. Key behavioral assessments included light-aversive and dark-seeking behaviors measured using a three-chamber box, pupil to iris ratio, periorbital tightening, periorbital allodynia and facial withdrawal thresholds. Our results demonstrated that cortical potassium chloride injections significantly increased photophobic behaviors, particularly in female rats. Specifically, potassium chloride-injected females demonstrated a significant reduction in the time spent in the light chamber (p = 0.001) and increased time in the dark chamber compared to control rats (p = 0.01), indicating heightened light-aversion. Females exhibited more substantial pupil constriction and eyelid closure at 180 min after potassium chloride injection compared to artificial cerebrospinal fluid injection, suggesting a stronger physiological response to light. Similarly, a greater percent of female rats displayed periorbital allodynia (withdrawal threshold <6 g) over a post injection time course compared to male rats. Among rats that exhibited periorbital allodynia at least two consecutive time points, females had significantly lower facial withdrawal thresholds than males at 60-, 90-, 120-, and 180-min post injection (p < 0.05), suggesting a difference in magnitude and duration. Furthermore, the area under the curve for the time course experiment indicated development of tactile allodynia in periorbital region among female rats (p < 0.0001). Altogether these findings highlight the importance of considering sex-specific differences in developing therapeutic strategies for the treatment of migraine. We report for the first time a complete time course analysis of migraine-related responses, providing a comprehensive overview of the dynamics involved. The results suggest that potassium chloride-induced cortical spreading depression may offer a valuable model for studying the underlying mechanisms and sex differences of photophobia in migraine, aiding in the development of targeted treatments.","2025","Cephalalgia : an international journal of headache"

However, a distinct imaging biomarker for differentiation mostly lacking. Intratumoral thrombosis has been reported as a histopathological biomarker for GB. To evaluate the fragmented intratumoral thrombosed microvasculature (FTV) signs on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) for distinguishing IDHwt and IDHmt tumors. Retrospective. Ninety-seven treatment-naïve patients with histopathologically confirmed IDHwt GB (54 males, 26 females) and IDHmt grade 4 astrocytoma (13 males, 4 females). 3-T, SWI, fluid-attenuated-inversion-recovery (FLAIR), T1-weighted, T2-weighted, PD-weighted, post-contrast T1-weighted and dynamic-contrast-enhanced (DCE)-MRI. SWI data were evaluated by three experienced neuroradiologists (S.S., 11 years; J.S., 15 years; R.K.G., 40 years of experience), who assessed FTV presence in necrotic and peri-necrotic regions. FTV was identified as intratumoral susceptibility signal having minimal or no interslice connections. Quantitative DCE-MRI parameters were derived using first-pass-analysis and extended Tofts model. FLAIR abnormal, contrast-enhancing, and necrotic regions were segmented using in-house developed U-Net architecture. Fleiss' Kappa, Cohen's Kappa, Shapiro-Wilk test, t tests or Mann-Whitney U test, receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, confusion matrix. A P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. Fleiss' kappa test provided 91% inter-rater agreement, and Cohen's kappa provided intrarater agreement ranged from 81% to 97%. The raters' accuracy in distinguishing IDHwt from IDHmt ranged from 92% to 94%. Some of the quantitative DCE-MRI parameters (CBV, Ve, and Ktrans) provided statistically significant differences in differentiating IDHwt and IDHmt. Ktrans demonstrated 80.3% sensitivity and 81.2% specificity, with ROC analysis showing an AUC of 0.77. FTV signs in necrotic and peri-necrotic regions on SWI demonstrated a high accuracy in distinguishing IDHwt from IDHmt. Qualitative assessment of FTV signs showed almost perfect inter-rater and intrarater agreement. Quantitative DCE-MRI metrics also showed statistically significant differentiation of IDHwt and IDHmt. This study demonstrates that preoperative imaging, particularly the visualization of the fragmented thrombosed vasculature (FTV) sign on susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI), effectively differentiates isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) wild-type (IDHwt) glioblastoma (GB) from IDH mutant (IDHmt) grade 4 astrocytomas. Over 90% of IDHwt GB patients displayed the FTV sign, a specific imaging biomarker absent in IDHmt cases. Perfusion parameters such as cerebral blood volume, Ve, and Ktrans were elevated in IDHwt gliomas, reflecting distinct vascular profiles. SWI offers a noninvasive and accurate diagnostic method, overcoming limitations of histopathology. Despite limitations like unequal sample sizes and retrospective analysis, this study underscores the clinical potential of SWI in improving glioma characterization and aiding treatment planning. 4 TECHNICAL EFFICACY: Stage 2.","2025","Journal of magnetic resonance imaging : JMRI"

A total of 165 patients (96 male; mean age, 61 years), comprising 111 with malignant STTs and 54 with benign STTs according to the 2020 WHO classification, underwent DCE-MRI with CS between June 2018 and June 2023. The clinical, qualitative, and quantitative parameters associated with conventional MRI were also obtained. During post-processing of the early arterial phase of DCE-MRI, the time-to-enhance (TTE), time-to-peak (TTP), initial area under the curve at 60 s (iAUC60), and maximum slope were calculated. Furthermore, the delayed arterial phase parameters of DCE-MRI, including Ktrans, Kep, Ve, and iAUC values and time-concentration curve (TCC) types, were determined. Clinical and MRI parameters were statistically analyzed to differentiate between benign and malignant tumors and their correlation with tumor grading. According to logistic regression analysis, the TTE value (P < 0.001) of the early arterial phase and Ve (P = 0.039) and iAUC (P = 0.006) values of the delayed arterial phase, as well as age, location, peritumoral edema, and contrast heterogeneity on conventional MRI, were significant (P = 0.001-0.015) in differentiating benign and malignant tumors. Among all the quantitative parameters, the TTE value had the highest accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.902. The grading of malignant tumors was significantly correlated with peritumoral edema; CE heterogeneity; visual diffusion restriction; minimum and mean ADC; TTP, Kep, and Ve values; and the TCC graph (all P < 0.05).

Exosomes, which play a role in tumor development and treatment response, are emerging as potential biomarkers for cancer diagnosis and efficacy prediction. Despite their promise, current exosome detection and isolation methods are cumbersome and time-consuming and often yield limited purity and quantity. In this study, we employed Raman spectroscopy to analyze the molecular changes in exosomes from the sera of HER2-positive breast cancer patients before and after two cycles of neoadjuvant therapy. Utilizing machine learning techniques (PCA, LDA, and SVM), we developed a predictive model with an AUC value exceeding 0.89. Additionally, we introduced an innovative HER2-positive exosome capture and detection system, termed Magnetic beads@HER2-Exos@HER2-SERS detection nanoprobes (HER2-MEDN). This system enabled us to efficiently extract and analyze HER2-positive exosomes, refining our predictive model to achieve an accuracy greater than 0.94. Our study has demonstrated the potential of the HER2-MEDN system in accurately predicting early treatment response, offering novel insights and methodologies for assessing the efficacy of neoadjuvant therapy in HER2-positive breast cancer.","2025","Analytical chemistry"

We extracted data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS) database from 2011 to 2016. Multivariable logistic regression, restricted cubic splines (RCSs) analysis, and linear correlation analysis were conducted to evaluate the association between LHR and risk of developing HUA. Subgroup analyses and interaction tests were also performed. A higher LHR was associated with an increased incidence of HUA (7.8% vs. 9.9% vs. 13.9, p < 0.001). The LHR was also higher in the HUA group compared to the non-HUA group (2.64 ± 1.07 vs. 2.40 ± 0.91, p < 0.001). When assessed as a continuous variable, LHR was independently associated with the risk of HUA (OR = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.16-1.39, p < 0.001). The risk of developing HUA was significantly higher among individuals with the highest LHR subgroup than those with the lowest LHR subgroup (OR = 1.81, 95% CI = 1.47-2.23, p < 0.001). RCS analysis revealed a significant nonlinear association between an increased LHR and a higher risk of developing HUA. The predictive abilities of LHR for HUA were 0.577. The composite variable comprising LHR and other traditional risk factors could significantly enhance the ability to predict HUA (C statistic = 0.677). In conclusion, a higher LHR was associated with an increased risk of developing HUA. Further studies on LHR could be beneficial for preventing and treating HUA.","2025","Clinical and translational science"

However, their performance is unsatisfactory in the Spanish population, where most cDCD livers are recovered using normothermic regional perfusion (NRP). Consequently, we explored the role of different machine learning-based classifiers as predictive models for graft survival. A risk stratification score integrated with the model of end-stage liver disease score in a donor-recipient (D-R) matching system was developed. This retrospective multicenter cohort study used 539 D-R pairs of cDCD livers recovered with NRP, including 20 donor, recipient, and NRP variables. The following machine learning-based classifiers were evaluated: logistic regression, ridge classifier, support vector classifier, multilayer perceptron, and random forest. The endpoints were the 3- and 12-mo graft survival rates. A 3- and 12-mo risk score was developed using the best model obtained. Logistic regression yielded the best performance at 3 mo (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.82) and 12 mo (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.83). A D-R matching system was proposed on the basis of the current model of end-stage liver disease score and cDCD-NRP risk score. The satisfactory performance of the proposed score within the study population suggests a significant potential to support liver allocation in cDCD-NRP grafts. External validation is challenging, but this methodology may be explored in other regions.","2025","Transplantation"

The primary goal of this study is to assess the ability of different indexes (including VAI, TyG, HOMA-IR, BMI, LAP, WHtR, TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, and TyG-WHtR) to predict MASLD in individuals diagnosed with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), particularly within the Chinese population. This cross-sectional study involved 1,742 patients with T2DM, recruited from the Metabolic Management Centers (MMC) at Suzhou Municipal Hospital. Abdominal ultrasonography was employed for MASLD diagnosis in patients with T2DM. The predictive accuracy of various screening indexes for MASLD in the Chinese T2DM population was evaluated using logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Among the 1,742 participants, 996 were diagnosed with MASLD. After adjusting for potential confounding factors, positive associations with the risk of MASLD were found for all the nine indexes. The lipid accumulation product (LAP) exhibited the greatest predictive value for detecting MASLD, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.786(95%CI 0.764,0.807), followed by BMI(AUC = 0.785), VAI(AUC = 0.744), TyG(AUC = 0.720), WHtR(AUC = 0.710) and HOMA-IR(AUC = 0.676). The composite Indexes (TyG-BMI, TyG-WC, TyG-WHtR) also showed considerable predictive ability with AUCs of 0.765, 0.752 and 0.748, respectively. Our results indicated that all nine indexes have favorable correlations with the risk of MASLD, and most of them have a good performance in predicting MASLD. According to our study, LAP was a reliable index for predicting MASLD among Chinese T2DM patients. The exploration of non-invasive screenings will provide significant support for the early detection and diagnosis of MASLD.","2025","Diabetology & metabolic syndrome"

The prognostic value of systemic inflammatory response (SIR) indicators, including the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), platelet-to-lymphocyte ratio (PLR), and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR), in predicting outcomes of UCS and US remains unclear. This study investigated the prognostic significance of SIR indicators for UCS and US. Clinicopathological data from 237 patients diagnosed with UCS or US across 14 hospitals from January 2008 to December 2017 were retrospectively analyzed. NLR, PLR, and MLR values were calculated from preoperative blood counts. Prognostic impact was evaluated using Kaplan-Meier survival analysis, Cox regression models, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Elevated NLR, PLR, and MLR were associated with poorer progression-free survival (PFS) in UCS. Additionally, a high NLR also indicated worse overall survival (OS) in UCS. In patients with US, only PLR was significantly associated with poorer PFS. Combining SIR indicators provided a stronger prognostic prediction for UCS compared to individual indicators. Multivariate analysis revealed that high levels of SIR indicators were an independent poor prognostic factor for both PFS and OS in UCS. SIR indicators, particularly when combined, are valuable prognostic markers in UCS, reflecting the inflammatory status and aiding in stratifying patients for tailored therapeutic strategies. These findings support the incorporation of SIR indicators into clinical practice for better management of patients with UCS.","2025","International journal of clinical oncology"

This analysis is a time-demanding task, currently done by an expert pathologist that visually inspects the samples. Given the effort required to localize the pathogen in images, a limited number of annotations might be available in an initial setting. Our goal is to design an approach that, using a limited set of annotations, is capable of obtaining results good enough to be used as a support tool. We propose to use autoencoders to learn the latent patterns of healthy patches and formulate a specific measure of the reconstruction error of the image in HSV space. ROC analysis is used to set the optimal threshold of this measure and the percentage of positive patches in a sample that determines the presence of H. pylori. Our method has been tested on an own database of 245 whole slide images (WSI) having 117 cases without H. pylori and different density of the bacteria in the remaining ones. The database has 1211 annotated patches, with only 163 positive patches. This dataset of positive annotations was used to train a baseline thresholding and an SVM using the features of a pre-trained RedNet-18 and ViT models. A 10-fold cross-validation shows that our method has better performance with 91% accuracy, 86% sensitivity, 96% specificity and 0.97 AUC in the diagnosis of H. pylori . Unlike classification approaches, our shallow autoencoder with threshold adaptation for the detection of anomalous staining is able to achieve competitive results with a limited set of annotated data.

We compared patients with food impaction with an associated EoE diagnosis to those without EoE and derived machine-learning models to predict EoE using International Classification of Diseases codes at discharge for identification. Of 286,886,714 emergency department visits, 146,084 were for food impaction, with 7093 cases coinciding with an EoE diagnosis (4.9%). Patients with EoE were more commonly young men with fewer overall comorbidities but higher incidences of obesity, asthma, gastritis, and allergic rhinitis. A significantly larger proportion in the EoE group (89.6%) underwent esophagogastroduodenoscopy compared to the non-EoE group (51.1%; P < 0.001) and had a higher rate of biopsy during esophagogastroduodenoscopy in the emergency department (54.9% vs 13.4%; P < 0.001). Our machine-learning models, incorporating patient demographics, hospital attributes, and comorbidities, had a sensitivity of 86.1% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.828.

Visual field defects (VFDs) are typically assessed using standard automated perimetry (SAP). However, SAP requires participants to understand instructions, maintain fixation and sustained attention, and provide overt responses. These aspects make SAP less suitable for very young or cognitively impaired populations. Here we investigate the feasibility of a new and less demanding form of perimetry. This method assesses visual sensitivity based on pupil responses while performing the perhaps simplest task imaginable: watching movies. We analyzed an existing dataset, with healthy participants (n = 70) freely watching movies with or without gaze-contingent simulated VFDs, either hemianopia (left- or right-sided) or glaucoma (large nasal arc, small nasal arc, and tunnel vision). Meanwhile, their gaze and pupil size were recorded. Using a recently published toolbox (Open-DPSM), we modeled the relative contribution of visual events to the pupil responses to indicate relative visual sensitivity across the visual field and to dissociate between conditions with and without simulated VFDs. Conditions with and without simulated VFDs could be dissociated, with an AUC ranging from 0.85 to 0.97, depending on the specific simulated VFD condition. In addition, the dissociation was better when including more movies in the modeling but the model with as few movies as 10 movies was sufficient for a good classification (AUC ranging from 0.84 to 0.96). Movie-viewing pupil perimetry is promising in providing complementary information for the diagnosis of VFDs, especially for those who are unable to perform conventional perimetry.","2025","Graefe's archive for clinical and experimental ophthalmology = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv fur klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie"

Current diagnostic methods, still predominantly relying on invasive biopsy, necessitate the exploration of noninvasive imaging alternatives for glioma characterization. In this prospective study, we investigated the utility of the spherical mean technique (SMT) in predicting the IDH status and histologic grade of adult-type diffuse gliomas. Patients with histologically confirmed adult-type diffuse glioma underwent a multiparametric MRI examination using a 3T system, which included a multishell diffusion sequence. Advanced diffusion parameters were obtained using SMT, diffusional kurtosis imaging, and ADC modeling. The diagnostic performance of studied parameters was evaluated by plotting receiver operating characteristic curves with associated area under curve, specificity, and sensitivity values. A total of 80 patients with a mean age of 48 (SD, 16) years were included in the study. SMT metrics, particularly microscopic fractional anisotropy (μFA), intraneurite voxel fraction, and μFA to the third power (μFA3), demonstrated strong diagnostic performance (all AUC = 0.905, 95% CI, 0.835-0.976; P < .001) in determining IDH status and compared favorably with diffusional kurtosis imaging and ADC models. These parameters also showed a strong predictive capability for tumor grade, with intraneurite voxel fraction and μFA achieving the highest diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.937, 95% CI, 0.880-0.993; P < .001). Control analyses on normal-appearing brain tissue confirmed the specificity of these metrics for tumor tissue.

Five machine learning algorithms were compared with select the optimal predictive model and a subsequent risk factor analysis was conducted. Of the 23,326 patients reviewed, 8,878 met the eligibility criteria for the HZ cohort. Among these, 801 patients (9.0%) progressed to severe PHN. Among the various machine learning approaches, XGBoost-an approach that combines multiple decision trees to improve predictive accuracy-performed the best in predicting outcomes (F1 score, 0.351; accuracy, 0.900; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.787). Using this model, we revealed eight major risk factors: older age, female sex, history of shingles and cancer, use of immunosuppressants and antidepressants, intensive initial pain, and the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio. When patients were categorized into low-risk and high-risk groups based on the predictive model, PHN was seven times more likely to occur in the high-risk group (p<0.001).

We developed a machine learning-based point-of-care prediction model for SLD that is readily available to the broader population with the aim of facilitating early detection and timely intervention and ultimately reducing the burden of SLD. We retrospectively analyzed the clinical data of 28,506 adults who had routine health check-ups in South Korea from January to December 2022. A total of 229,162 individuals were included in the external validation study. Data were analyzed and predictions were made using a logistic regression model with machine learning algorithms. A total of 20,094 individuals were categorized into SLD and non-SLD groups on the basis of the presence of fatty liver disease. We developed three prediction models: SLD model 1, which included age and body mass index (BMI); SLD model 2, which included BMI and body fat per muscle mass; and SLD model 3, which included BMI and visceral fat per muscle mass. In the derivation cohort, the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was 0.817 for model 1, 0.821 for model 2, and 0.820 for model 3. In the internal validation cohort, 86.9% of individuals were correctly classified by the SLD models. The external validation study revealed an AUROC above 0.84 for all the models. As our three novel SLD prediction models are cost-effective, noninvasive, and accessible, they could serve as validated clinical tools for mass screening of SLD.","2025","Gut and liver"

The aim of this study was to evaluate the ability of Fourier-transform mid-infrared (FT-MIR) spectroscopy to authenticate animal welfare parameters, farming practices, and dairy systems. Data on farm characteristics were obtained from the Parmigiano Reggiano Consortium in northern Italy. Animal welfare data were collected by trained veterinarians using the assessment protocol developed by the Italian National Reference Center for Animal Welfare (CREnBA), while bulk milk test-day data were obtained from the laboratory of the Breeders Association of the Emilia Romagna Region (ARAER). A merged final data set of 12,083 bulk FT-MIR spectra records from 949 farms was created. Using a non-hierarchical clustering approach, the farms were classified into 5 dairy systems: 2 'traditional' systems, comprising farms located in either the Apennines or the Po Plain, and 2 'modern' systems, those that used TMR and that did not; a further 'traditional' dairy system was identified comprising farms rearing local breeds. To evaluate the ability of bulk milk to capture differences in farming systems, we conducted an ANOVA on milk composition. The linear models included the following effects: season, dairy system, farm, and the interaction between dairy system and season. The effect of the dairy system was significant for all milk composition traits. A 10-iteration linear discriminant analysis (LDA) was used to evaluate the discriminative ability of the spectra in classifying farming practices and dairy systems. The average results of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC-AUC) revealed good authentication performance for genetic type (0.98), housing system (0.91), and feeding system (0.89), medium-low authentication performance for geographical area (0.70), while poor results were obtained for the percentage of concentrate in the diet and animal welfare parameters (0.57 - 0.64). With regard to dairy systems, the best result was obtained when dairy systems were grouped into 2 simplified categories, 'traditional' vs 'modern' (0.89), instead of the 5 categories (0.87). The results of this study show that FT-MIR is a useful tool for authenticating farming practices and dairy systems, but not animal welfare as defined by CREnBA evaluation criteria. Our results show that infrared spectroscopy has the potential to authenticate dairy products and quality label certifications.","2025","Journal of dairy science"

The purpose of this study was to use FTIR spectroscopy collected from recent calving to the first artificial insemination (AI) to predict the cow's likelihood of conception to first AI, first or second AI. This study specifically focused on the role of FTIR spectral and farm data collected at different time windows in improving the accuracy of model for predicting the cow's likelihood of conception to first AI, first or second AI. From 2019 to 2023, fertility information of 10,873 Holstein dairy cows in China were collected, coupled with 21,928 spectral data. First, cows were classified into ""good"" and ""poor."" Strategy 1 (S1) defined ""good"" as cows conceived at first AI and ""poor"" as the others. Strategy 2 (S2) defined ""good"" as cows conceived at first or second AI and ""poor"" as the others. Second, the partial least squares discriminant analysis was used to establish models for predicting the likelihood of conception to first AI, first or second AI. The model was assessed using a cross-validation (CV) set and herd-independent-external validation (HEV) set. The study also focused on examining the potential correlation between the accuracy of prediction and the period of spectral and farm data collection by analyzing the diagnostic performance of the model at 8 different time windows: '0 to 7 d postpartum (dpp)', '8 to 14 dpp', '15 to 21 dpp', '22 to 30 dpp', '31 to 45 dpp', '46 to 60 dpp', ' ≥ 61 dpp', and '0 to 7 d before the first AI'. The results showed that the model based on S1 performed better while in proximity to the first AI with AUCCV and AUCHEV of 0.621 and 0.633, respectively. Models based on S2 exhibited superior performance throughout the late phase of uterine involution. The optimal model was developed by using spectral data collected from '22 to 30 dpp'. The AUCCV and AUCHEV were 0.644 and 0.660, respectively, which was higher than that of S1. This study demonstrates the potential of using FTIR spectral data to predict the cow's ability to conceive. The model developed from data collected within a certain time window exhibited better prediction accuracy, particularly during 22 to 30 dpp and 0 to 7 d before the first AI. This study offers novel perspectives on alternate approaches for assessing the fertility of cows, which will contribute to the regularization and sustainability of farms, as well as to the precision management of agriculture.","2025","Journal of dairy science"

A previously described blood biomarker panel to predict cardiovascular (CV) events was evaluated in patients with CTO. From 1,251 patients in the CASABLANCA study, 241 participants with a CTO were followed for an average of 4 years for occurrence of major adverse CV events (MACE, CV death, nonfatal myocardial infarction or stroke) and CV death/heart failure (HF) hospitalization. Results of a biomarker panel (kidney injury molecule-1, N-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptide, osteopontin, and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-1) from baseline samples were expressed as low-, medium-, and high-risk. By 4 years, a total of 67 (27.8%) MACE and 56 (23.2%) CV death/HF hospitalization events occurred. The C-statistic of the panel for MACE through 4 years was 0.79 (p < 0.001). Considering the low-risk group as referent, the hazard ratio (HR) of MACE by 4 years was 6.65 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.98 to 14.8) and 12.4 (95% CI:5.17 to 29.6) for the medium and high-risk groups (both p < 0.001). The C-statistic for CVD/HF hospitalization by 4 years was 0.84 (p < 0.001). Compared to the low-risk score group, the medium and high-risk groups had HR of 5.61 (95% CI: 2.33 to 13.5) and 15.6 (95% CI: 6.18, 39.2; both p value <0.001). In conclusion, a multiple biomarker panel assisted in discriminating a broad range of risk for adverse outcomes in patients with coronary CTO.

However, sex differences in factors associated with suicide attempts (SAs) in first-episode and drug-naïve (FEDN) patients with psychotic major depression (PMD) remain unclear. In this study, 171 patients with FEDN PMD were recruited. Patients' symptoms were assessed using the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD), Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA), and Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) positive subscale. In addition, metabolic parameters and thyroid hormone levels were measured. The prevalence of SA was remarkably high in both male and female PMD patients (53.19% vs. 50.81%), without significant differences between the two groups. In male PMD patients, the combination of marital status and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels was found to effectively distinguish between SA and non-SA cases, with an AUC value of 0.87. In addition, the HAMD score and diastolic blood pressure (BP) were significantly associated with the frequency of SAs in this subgroup. For female PMD patients, the combination of positive score, diastolic BP, TSH, and antithyroglobulin was found to be an effective discriminator between SA and non-SA cases, with an AUC of 0.91. Furthermore, duration of illness, positive score, systolic BP, and thyroid peroxidase antibody were found to be significantly associated with the frequency of SAs in this subgroup. Our results indicate a high incidence of SAs in both men and women with PMD. Several clinically relevant factors, metabolic parameters, and thyroid hormone function contribute to sex differences in SAs in FEDN PMD patients.","2025","Psychopathology"

This study aimed to identify factors influencing suicide in patients with digestive system tumors using a large sample size from public databases and to develop a clinically applicable risk prediction model, thereby providing a reference for clinical interventions. Data for 173,804 patients diagnosed with digestive system tumors between 1998 and 2015 were obtained from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database. The standard mortality rate of suicide among digestive system tumor patients was compared with that of the general US population. Predictors of suicide in patients with digestive system tumors were identified using lasso regression and logistic regression, and subsequently visualized with a nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to determine the predictive accuracy of the nomogram. A calibration curve was plotted to assess the concordance between predicted and observed probabilities. Additionally, decision curve analysis and clinical influence curves were used to evaluate the clinical utility of the nomogram. A total of 131,354 patients from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results database were used to develop the model; 652 (0.5%) of those patients died by suicide. The cohort was followed for a cumulative duration of 1,277,281.75 person-years. Age, sex, tumor grade, staging, surgical intervention, chemotherapy, marital status, and place of residence were identified as independent predictors of suicide in patients with digestive system tumors. The nomogram constructed based on these predictors demonstrated high predictive accuracy, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.78. Additionally, the calibration curve indicated a strong concordance between the predicted and observed probabilities. The decision curve analysis and clinical influence curves further validated the clinical applicability of the nomogram. We identified factors influencing suicide in patients with digestive system tumors and developed a robust prediction model to guide decision making.","2025","Surgery"

We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and Wanfang Data databases for relevant original studies from database inception to March 2024. The quality of the included studies was evaluated using the QUADAS-2 tool. A bivariate random-effects model was used to calculate the pooled sensitivity and specificity of DECT. The threshold effect was determined by calculating Spearman correlation coefficients, meta-regression and subgroup analysis were performed to evaluate the sources of variability. Publication bias was assessed using the asymmetry of Deek's funnel plot. Thirteen studies involving 951 patients (2,782 lymph nodes) were included in this meta-analysis. We analyzed four quantitative parameters of DECT, among which the normalized iodine concentration (NIC) in the arterial phase had the highest area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The combined sensitivity, specificity, and AUC were 83 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 76 % - 89 %), 90 % (95 % CI: 82 % - 95 %), and 0.92 (95 % CI: 0.90 - 0.94), respectively. The Spearman correlation coefficient was - 0.244 (p = 0.4). Meta-regression and subgroup analysis revealed that use of blinding, mean patients' age, female proportion, presence of Hashimoto's thyroiditis, number of lymph nodes included in the study, and slice thickness were sources of heterogeneity for the NIC in the arterial phase. No significant publication bias was observed among the studies.

However, manually designing these networks is often time-consuming and suboptimal. Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates this process, potentially finding more efficient and effective models. This study provides a comprehensive comparative analysis of our two NAS methods, PBC-NAS and BioNAS, across multiple biomedical image classification tasks using the MedMNIST dataset. Our experiments evaluate these methods based on classification performance (Accuracy (ACC) and Area Under the Curve (AUC)) and computational complexity (Floating Point Operation Counts). Results demonstrate that BioNAS models slightly outperform PBC-NAS models in accuracy, with BioNAS-2 achieving the highest average accuracy of 0.848. However, PBC-NAS models exhibit superior computational efficiency, with PBC-NAS-2 achieving the lowest average FLOPs of 0.82 GB. Both methods outperform state-of-the-art architectures like ResNet-18 and ResNet-50 and AutoML frameworks such as auto-sklearn, AutoKeras, and Google AutoML. Additionally, PBC-NAS and BioNAS outperform other NAS studies in average ACC results (except MSTF-NAS), and show highly competitive results in average AUC. We conduct extensive ablation studies to investigate the impact of architectural parameters, the effectiveness of fine-tuning, search space efficiency, and the discriminative performance of generated architectures. These studies reveal that larger filter sizes and specific numbers of stacks or modules enhance performance. Fine-tuning existing architectures can achieve nearly optimal results without separating NAS for each dataset. Furthermore, we analyze search space efficiency, uncovering patterns in frequently selected operations and architectural choices. This study highlights the strengths and efficiencies of PBC-NAS and BioNAS, providing valuable insights and guidance for future research and practical applications in biomedical image classification.","2025","Artificial intelligence in medicine"

However, it is unclear how the preoperative status of the patient influences their likelihood of achieving each CIBS. (1) What proportion of patients achieve commonly used CIBS after TSA? (2) Is there a relationship between a patients' preoperative function and their probability of achieving different CIBS? (3) Does there exist preoperative ranges for each outcome measure that are associated with greater achievement of CIBS? We retrospectively queried a multicenter shoulder arthroplasty database for primary anatomic TSA (aTSA) and reverse TSA (rTSA). A total of 2041 aTSAs and 3205 rTSAs were included. The mean ± SD age at time of surgery was 66 ± 9 years for aTSAs and 72 ± 8 years for rTSAs. In all, 51% (1049 of 2041) of aTSAs and 61% (1955 of 3205) of rTSAs were in patients who were women. For aTSAs, osteoarthritis with an intact rotator cuff was the most common preoperative diagnosis (92% [1869 of 2041]). For rTSAs, the most common preoperative diagnoses included rotator cuff tear arthropathy (40% [1280 of 3205]), osteoarthritis with an intact rotator cuff (24% [780 of 3205]), osteoarthritis with a torn rotator cuff (20% [632 of 3205]), and massive rotator cuff tear (10% [309 of 3205]). Outcomes were evaluated at latest follow-up (aTSA 61 ± 36 months, rTSA 47 ± 26 months) and consisted of ROM (abduction, forward elevation, external and internal rotation) as well as the most commonly used outcome scores: the Simple Shoulder Test (SST), Constant score, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) score, Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI), and the Shoulder Arthroplasty Smart (SAS) score. The CIBS that we evaluated included the minimum clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), patient acceptable symptom state (PASS), minimum clinically important percentage of maximal possible improvement (MCI-%MPI), and substantial clinically important percentage of maximal possible improvement (SCI-%MPI). Prosthesis-specific anchor-based CIBS were adopted from prior publications on patients from this database. Multivariable regression was performed to identify the relationship between preoperative outcome measures and achievement of CIBS. Additionally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses were performed to determine whether thresholds in preoperative outcome measures were associated with achieving CIBS. For all ROM measures and outcome scores, poorer preoperative ROM was associated with greater odds of achieving the MCID and SCB but lower odds of achieving the PASS. For the SST and the two scores without ceiling effects (the Constant and SAS scores), poorer preoperative outcome scores were associated with greater odds of achieving the MCI-%MPI and SCI-%MPI, but no association was demonstrated for the ASES, SPADI, and UCLA scores. Graphical analysis demonstrated that patients with greater preoperative ROM and outcome scores had a lower probability of achieving the MCID and SCB but a higher probability of achieving the PASS. For outcome scores with known ceiling effects, patients with more favorable preoperative outcome scores were more likely to achieve the MCI-%MPI and SCI-%MPI than the MCID and SCB, respectively. For outcome scores without ceiling effects, patients undergoing aTSA were more likely to achieve the MCID, MCI-%MPI, and the SCI-%MPI than the SCB, but no clear trend was identified for patients undergoing rTSA. On ROC curve analysis, identified thresholds were reasonably accurate (area under the curve > 0.7) for achievement of measures of absolute improvement (the MCID and SCB), but not for absolute postoperative status (the PASS) or relative improvement (the MCI-%MPI and SCI-%MPI). While most patients reported being ""much better"" (aTSA 75%, rTSA 76%) or ""better"" (aTSA 15%, rTSA 18%) compared with before surgery, 10% of aTSAs and 6% of rTSAs were either ""unchanged"" or ""worse."" Patients' likelihood of achieving CIBS depends in part on their baseline function and whether success is defined as absolute improvement, absolute postoperative status, or relative improvement. Patients with more favorable preoperative status are more likely to achieve CIBS that evaluate relative improvement (the MCI-%MPI and SCI-%MPI) than absolute improvement (the MCID and SCB). Future studies are needed to determine which individual CIBS or combinations thereof most accurately represent clinically relevant benefit.

We assessed 361 participants across the Alzheimer's disease (AD) and non-AD continuum and measured plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, p-tau181, amyloid beta (Aβ)42/40 ratio, neurofilament light chain, and glial fibrillary acidic protein levels at two medical centers. We evaluated the diagnostic potential of these biomarkers. Among all plasma biomarkers, p-tau217 had the highest consistency with amyloid PET results (area under the curve = 0.94), and a cutoff value could have reduced the number of confirmatory amyloid PET scans by 57.5%. In amyloid PET-positive cases intending to use anti-amyloid therapy, p-tau217 level, along with clinical parameters, had the highest predictive ability for low/intermediate tau burden. A two-step workflow based on p-tau217 and confirmatory amyloid PET could accurately classify AD patients showing low/intermediate tau burden. The emergence of anti-amyloid therapy increases the need to accurately diagnose Alzheimer's disease (AD). The use of plasma biomarkers, especially phosphorylated tau 217 (p-tau217), can help in the diagnosis of AD. P-tau217 is a better predictor of amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) positivity than other core biomarkers. In amyloid PET-positive individuals, p-tau217 can predict tau burden.

Clinical assessment is qualitative; quantitative evaluation is feasible using the K2 leakage parameter from dynamic susceptibility contrast MRI. However, contrast agent-based techniques are limited in patients with renal dysfunction and insensitive to subtle impairments. Assessing water transport times across the BBB (Tex) by multi-echo arterial spin labeling promises to detect BBB impairments noninvasively and potentially more sensitively. We hypothesized that reduced Tex indicates impaired BBB. Furthermore, we assumed higher sensitivity for Tex than dynamic susceptibility contrast-based K2, because arterial spin labeling uses water as a freely diffusible tracer. We acquired 3T MRI data from 28 patients with intraparenchymal brain tumors (World Health Organization Grade 3 & 4 gliomas [n = 17] or metastases [n = 11]) and 17 age-matched healthy controls. The protocol included multi-echo and single-echo Hadamard-encoded arterial spin labeling, dynamic susceptibility contrast, and conventional clinical imaging. Tex was calculated using a T2-dependent multi-compartment model. Areas of contrast-enhancing tissue, edema, and normal-appearing tissue were automatically segmented, and parameter values were compared across volumes of interest and between patients and healthy controls. Tex was significantly reduced (-20.3%) in contrast-enhancing tissue compared with normal-appearing gray matter and correlated well with |K2| (r = -0.347). Compared with healthy controls, Tex was significantly lower in tumor patients' normal-appearing gray matter (Tex,tumor = 0.141 ± 0.032 s vs. Tex,HC = 0.172 ± 0.036 s) and normal-appearing white matter (Tex,tumor = 0.116 ± 0.015 vs. Tex,HC = 0.127 ± 0.017 s), whereas |K2| did not differ significantly. Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed a larger area under the curve for Tex (0.784) than K2 (0.604). Tex is sensitive to pathophysiologically impaired BBB.

Therefore, this study aimed to establish reference curves for vital tissue perfusion across target tissues using this imaging modality. Data from five prospective study cohorts conducted in three Dutch academic medical centres between December 2018 and June 2023 was included. Quantitative analysis using time-intensity curves was performed in ten target tissues, including the colon, ileum, gastric conduit, deep inferior epigastric artery perforator (DIEP) flap, skin of the foot, trachea, sternocleidomastoid muscle (SCM), carotid artery, parathyroid gland, and skin of the neck. A total of 178 patients were included in this study, representing 303 target tissues. Three different patterns of reference curves were identified based on a subjective assessment. Seven out of ten tissues showed a reference curve with rapid inflow (median time-to-max (tmax): 13.0-17.8 s, median maximum-normalized-slope (slope norm): 10.6-12.6%/sec), short outflow (median area-under-the-curve of tmax + 60 s (AUC60): 65.0-85.1%) followed by a gradual/absent outflow. Secondly, the DIEP flap and SCM tissue showed a reference curve with longer inflow (median tmax: 24.0, 22.0 s, median slope norm: 9.3, 9.7%/sec respectively) and reduced outflow (median AUC60: 89.1, 89.0% respectively). Thirdly, the skin of the foot showed slow inflow (median tmax 141.1 s, median norm slope 2.1%/sec) without outflow.

A recently developed composite risk tool, the exposome score for schizophrenia (ES-SCZ), which controls for intercorrelations between risk factors, has shown fair to good performance. We tested the transdiagnostic psychosis classifier performance of the ES-SCZ with the Bipolar-Schizophrenia Network for Intermedial Phenotypes data and examined its relationship with clinical-level outcomes. We computed the case-control classifier performance for the ES-SCZ from cross-sectional data on 1055 volunteers with psychotic diagnoses (schizophrenia, schizoaffective, bipolar psychosis) and 510 controls. Multivariate regression models were used to control for the correlations between outcomes and to correct for the effects of age, sex, and family socioeconomic status across outcomes. We estimated association for the ES-SCZ with psychosis and mood symptom severity, the 5-factor model of personality, and function across biologically defined biotypes, traditional diagnostic categories, and controls. ES-SCZ classifier performance for psychosis was fair to good. ES-SCZ associations with personality factor scores were qualitatively similar between psychosis groups and controls with decreased conscientiousness and agreeableness and increased neuroticism. The patterns of associations between ES-SCZ and symptoms differed across biotypes and diagnoses. Biotype 3 and bipolar disorder had consistent within-group associations where greater exposome score predicted more severe symptoms and worse function. ES-SCZ performance was consistent with previous reports in this transdiagnostic psychosis sample (adjusted odds ratio: 3.331 [2.834, 3.915], P < .001; area under the curve: 0.762 [0.735, 0.789]).

This study utilized a previously validated model for predicting post-POP surgery SSI within 90 days of surgery using a Medicare population. For this study, the model was externally validated and recalibrated using the Premier Healthcare Database (PHD) and the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project (NSQIP) database. Discriminatory performance was assessed via the c-statistic and calibration was assessed using calibration curves. Methods of recalibration in the large and logistic recalibration were used to update the models. The PHD contained 420,277 POP procedures meeting the inclusion criteria and 1.6% resulted in SSI. The NSQIP dataset contained 62,553 POP surgeries and 1.4% resulted in SSI. Discrimination of the original model was comparable with that seen in the initial validation (c-statistic = 0.57 in PHD, 0.59 in NSQIP vs 0.60 in the original Medicare data). Recalibration greatly improved model calibration when evaluated in NSQIP data. A previously developed model for predicting SSI after POP surgery demonstrated stable discriminatory ability when externally validated on the PHD and NSQIP databases.

Despite its advantages, such as minimal invasiveness and a shorter recovery time, postoperative complications can occur, thereby necessitating effective risk assessment tools to identify at-risk patients. This study evaluated the Estimation of Physiologic Ability and Surgical Stress (E-PASS) scoring system's utility in predicting postoperative complications following standard PCNL. This retrospective study included 218 patients who underwent standard PCNL from June 2020 to August 2024 at our institution. Data on demographics, comorbidities, and perioperative factors were collected and analyzed. Postoperative complications were classified using the modified Clavien-Dindo system. The E-PASS scoring system, which incorporates the Preoperative Risk Score (PRS), Surgical Stress Score (SSS), and Comprehensive Risk Score (CRS), was applied to stratify risk. Postoperative complications occurred in 38 patients (17.4%). Significant predictors included advanced age, higher American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) scores, and comorbidities like diabetes and coronary artery disease. Intraoperative factors, such as prolonged operative times, number of access and greater blood loss, were also associated with complications. Multivariate analysis identified higher CRS and greater stone burden as independent predictors (p = 0.012 and p = 0.037, respectively). The CRS demonstrated moderate discrimination, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.747. The E-PASS scoring system effectively predicts postoperative complications in PCNL, underscoring the importance of thorough preoperative and intraoperative evaluation.

MMP9 is elevated in tissues from women experiencing preterm labor, and previous research has shown that the addition of combined matrix metallopeptidases 2 and 9 (MMP2/9) enhances uterine contractions. We hypothesized that adding MMP9 alone would enhance myometrial contractions and that specific MMP9 inhibition would suppress uterine contractions. In myometrial tissue from women undergoing term Caesarean sections, we observed an increased contractile response as measured by area under the curve over time in tissues treated with MMP9 compared to vehicle-treated controls (p = 0.0003). This effect was primarily due to increased contraction frequency in MMP9-treated tissues compared to controls (p < 0.0001). Specific inhibition of MMP9 with the highly selective MMP9 inhibitor 1 (AG-L-66085) reduced contractile responses in myometrial tissues from pregnant women. We observed a reduction in the oxytocin-induced contractile response as measured by area under the curve over time (p < 0.0001) and contraction amplitude (p < 0.0068) in AG-L-66085-treated tissues compared to vehicle-treated controls. To determine the effects of MMP9 inhibition in the absence of exogenous oxytocin, we tested the effects of AG-L-66085 on spontaneous contractions. The area under the curve (p = 0.0415) and amplitude (p = 0.0354) of spontaneous contractions were reduced in response to 1 μM AG-L-66085, and the inhibitory effects increased as the AG-L-66085 concentration increased. Together, these data support the hypothesis that elevated MMP9 promotes myometrial contractions and labor, while its inhibition promotes relaxation.","2025","Reproductive sciences (Thousand Oaks, Calif.)"

This study aims to investigate the association of seminal microbiota and testicular steroidogenesis. One hundred adult eugonadal men were consecutively enrolled. The seminal concentration of Lactobacilli, anaerobic and facultative bacteria, as well as serum levels of luteinizing hormone (LH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), and total testosterone (TT) were evaluated. Unadjusted and adjusted multi-regression models were built to evaluate the relationship between seminal Lactobacilli, anaerobic and facultative bacteria, and Lactobacilli/total bacteria ratio, and serum LH, FSH, and TT. The concentrations of seminal Lactobacilli, anaerobic, and facultative bacteria predictive of serum TT values in the lowest quartile (< 3.8 ng/mL) were calculated. TT levels were weakly and positively correlated with seminal Lactobacillus concentration (r = 0.33; p = 0.001), with seminal Lactobacilli/total bacteria ratio (r = 0.89; p < 0.001), and negatively with anaerobic and facultative bacteria (r = - 0.69; p < 0.001). Opposite correlations were found for gonadotropin concentrations. These data persisted after adjustment for confounding factors. Seminal concentration of Lactobacilli ≤ 0.1 × 106/mL (AUC 0.917, 95% CI: 0.845 to 0.963), of anaerobic and facultative bacteria > 2 × 104/mL (AUC 0.924, 95% CI: 0.853 to 0.967), or a Lactobacilli/total bacteria ratio ≤ 90% (AUC 0.910, 95% CI: 0.837 to 0.958) were found to predict serum TT level < 3.8 ng/mL with a sensitivity of 92.0% and a specificity of 88.0%.

However, in the setting of aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage (aSAH), several previous studies have reported no association between ultrasonically measured ONSD and ICP. In this study, we evaluate ONSD in patients with aSAH using a novel method of automated real-time ultrasonographic measurements and explore whether factors such as having undergone surgery affects its association to ICP. We prospectively included adult patients with aSAH undergoing invasive ICP monitoring. ONSD was obtained using a prototype ultrasound machine with software for real-time automated measurements at the bedside. Correlation between ONSD and ICP was explored, and the ability of ONSD to discriminate dichotomized ICP was evaluated. Abovementioned analyses were performed for the whole cohort and repeated for subgroups by whether the basal cisterns had been surgically entered before ultrasound examination. Twenty-six ultrasound examinations were performed in 20 patients. There was a positive correlation between ONSD and ICP (R = 0.43; p = 0.03). In the subgroup where the basal cisterns had not been surgically entered before ultrasound examination, there was a stronger correlation (R = 0.55; p = 0.01), whereas no correlation was seen in the subgroup where the basal cisterns had been surgically entered (R = - 0.16; p = 0.70). ONSD displayed an ability to discriminate ICP dichotomized at ≥ 15 mm Hg (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.84, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.65-0.96). Subgroup analysis revealed a perfect discriminatory ability (AUC = 1, 95% CI 0.81-1) where the basal cisterns had not been surgically entered and no discriminatory ability (AUC = 0.47, 95% CI 0.16-0.84) where the basal cisterns had been surgically entered before ultrasound examination. Automatically measured ONSD correlated well with ICP and displayed a perfect discriminatory ability in patients with aSAH in whom the basal cisterns had not been entered surgically before ultrasound examination, and may be a clinically valuable noninvasive marker of ICP in these patients. Caution should be exercised in using ONSD in patients in whom the basal cisterns have been entered surgically before ONSD measurements, as no association was observed in this subgroup.","2025","Neurocritical care"

Building on this review, the workgroup developed 17 clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau PET may be considered. A modified Delphi approach was used to rate each scenario by consensus as ""rarely appropriate,"" ""uncertain,"" or ""appropriate."" Ratings were performed separately for amyloid and tau PET as stand-alone modalities. For amyloid PET, seven scenarios were rated as appropriate, two as uncertain, and eight as rarely appropriate. For tau PET, five scenarios were rated as appropriate, six as uncertain, and six as rarely appropriate. AUC for amyloid and tau PET provide expert recommendations for clinical use of these technologies in the evolving landscape of diagnostics and therapeutics for Alzheimer's disease. A multidisciplinary workgroup convened by the Alzheimer's Association and the Society of Nuclear Medicine and Molecular Imaging updated the appropriate use criteria (AUC) for amyloid positron emission tomography (PET) and to develop AUC for tau PET. The goal of these updated AUC is to assist clinicians in identifying clinical scenarios in which amyloid or tau PET may be useful for guiding the diagnosis and management of patients who have, or are at risk for, cognitive decline These updated AUC are intended for dementia specialists who spend a significant proportion of their clinical effort caring for patients with cognitive complaints, as well as serve as a general reference for a broader audience interested in implementation of amyloid and tau PET in clinical practice.","2025","Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association"

However, the molecular and immune mechanisms underlying this association remain unclear. This study initially downloaded gene expression profiles for psoriasis and AF from the Gene Expression Omnibus database. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) for both conditions were identified and hub genes were selected. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis and the prediction and validation of transcription factors (TFs) were conducted. Immune cell infiltration was analyzed using the CIBERSORT method. Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis was performed to explore the potential causal relationships between 731 Immunophenotypes and the risk of psoriasis and AF. A total of 1627 DEGs were identified from the psoriasis and AF datasets. Intersection analysis revealed 119 common DEGs. 10 potential biomarker hub genes, including GZMB, FCGR3B, LILRB2, IL7R, CD2, MYD88, NCF2, TLR2, GZMA, and CXCR2. ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve scores for the hub genes were 0.987 and 1.00 for psoriasis and AF, respectively. USF2, NFKB1 and RELA were predicted to be key TFs. Immune cell infiltration analysis indicated significant differences in T cell follicular helper, T cell gamma delta, and monocytes in the two diseases. MR analysis revealed 28 Immunophenotypes potentially associated with psoriasis risk and 18 traits potentially associated with AF risk. Notably, HLA DR + Natural Killer and CD39 on granulocyte cells were identified as influencing the risk of both diseases. This study preliminarily identified biomarkers and explored the molecular mechanisms of psoriasis and AF, highlighting immune cells potentially associated with disease pathogenesis. These findings provide a scientific basis for developing new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies, aiding in better prevention and management of AF risk in psoriasis patients.","2025","Archives of dermatological research"

This cross-sectional study was conducted on primary CRS patients scheduled for surgery. All patients were assessed by a pulmonologist for asthma diagnosis. Tissues were collected during surgery and evaluated for TEC. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to determine significant factors and the optimal cut-off points of TEC associated with asthma. A total of 103 CRS patients were included. Ten patients (9.7%) had underlying asthma, while 13 (12.6%) were first diagnosed by the pulmonologist. TEC ≥40 cells per high-powered field (HPF) exhibited a significant correlation with asthma (area under the curve = 0.71, p < 0.001). The sensitivity of this cut-off point was 0.70 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.47-0.87), and specificity was 0.66 (95% CI = 0.55-0.76). Positive predictive value and negative predictive value were 0.37 and 0.88, respectively.

This study assessed the potential of plasma biomarkers for differential diagnosis. This cohort study included 374 participants (96 AD, 278 FTLD). Plasma phosphorylated tau (p-tau)217, neurofilament light chain (NfL), brain-derived tau, glial fibrillary acidic protein, and the amyloid beta1-42/1-40 ratio were measured. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses assessed diagnostic accuracy, and a three-range threshold approach was used to stratify patients based on the most accurate biomarker. Plasma p-tau217 effectively distinguished AD from FTLD, with the NfL/p-tau217 ratio showing superior accuracy. The three-range approach identified thresholds with 95% and 97.5% sensitivity and specificity, reducing the need for cerebrospinal fluid testing by 75% and 54%, respectively. Plasma p-tau217 and the NfL/p-tau217 ratio are promising non-invasive biomarkers for differentiating AD from FTLD, suggesting their use as a potential alternative to traditional diagnostic methods.

Our primary objective was to derive and internally validate a novel Cirrhosis Risk Instrument for Stratifying Post-Emergency department mortality (CRISPE) for the outcomes of 14- and 30-day post-ED mortality. Secondarily, we externally validated the existing Model for End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) scores for explicit use in ED patients and prediction of the same outcomes. A cohort of 2093 adults with cirrhosis, at 16 sites in a statewide health system, was analyzed for 119 candidate variables available at ED disposition. LASSO with 10-fold cross-validation was used in variable selection for 14-day (CRISPE-14) and 30-day (CRISPE-30) logistic regression models. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was calculated for each variant of the CRISPE and MELD scores and compared via Delong's test. Predictions were compared to actual ED disposition for predictive value and reclassification statistics. Median (interquartile range [IQR]) characteristics of the cohort were age 62 (53-70) years and MELD 3.0 13.0 (8.0-20.0). Mortality was 4.3% and 8.5% at 14 and 30 days, respectively. CRISPE-14 and CRISPE-30 outperformed each MELD variant, achieving AUROC of 0.824 (95% CI: 0.781-0.866) and 0.829 (0.796-0.861), respectively. MELD 3.0 AUROCs were 0.724 (0.667-0.781) and 0.715 (0.672-0.781), respectively. Compared to ED disposition, CRISPE-14, CRISPE-30, and MELD 3.0 significantly improved positive and negative predictive value and net reclassification index at multiple cutoffs. Applying CRISPE-30 (cutoff 4.5) favorably reclassified one net ED disposition for mortality for every 12 patients, while MELD 3.0 net reclassified one disposition per 84 patients. CDIs may be useful in risk-stratifying ED patients with cirrhosis and aiding disposition decision making.

Disulfidptosis represents a novel form of cell death; however, the mechanism of disulfidptosis in ES remains unclear. Our aim is to explore the disulfidptosis-related prognostic signature in ES. Utilizing transcriptomic and clinical data of ES, disulfidptosis-related hub genes (DRHGs) were identified by differential gene expression analysis and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) Cox regression analysis. A disulfidptosis-related risk score model (DRRS) was constructed based on these DRHGs. The performance of DRRS was assessed using survival analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Immune cell infiltration in different risk subgroups and correlations between DRRS and antitumor reagents were also analyzed. In this study, we developed a disulfidptosis-related prognostic feature based on LRPPRC (leucine rich pentatricopeptide repeat containing), IQGAP1 (IQ motif containing GTPase activating protein 1), NDUFS1 (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase core subunit S1), and TLN1 (talin 1), which may serve as a predictive and independent risk factor for ES. ES patients in the high-risk group exhibited a poorer prognosis, had a higher proportion of myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) and M2 type of tumor-associated macrophages, and showed heightened sensitivity to some antitumor agents such as nilotinib and olaparib. This study is the first to construct a disulfidptosis-related prognostic signature that may predict the prognosis and immune response in ES patients, thereby providing a new reference for understanding the mechanisms of ES and guiding immunotherapy.","2025","Journal of orthopaedic research : official publication of the Orthopaedic Research Society"

Recent research suggests that the interaction of adipose tissue products, such as adiponectin resistin and uric acid, is essential in MetS onset. To examine the role of resistin and adiponectin ratios with uric acid in predicting MetS onset T2DM patients. In a two-year prospective study, 72 T2DM patients were categorised into MetS and non-MetS, according to MetS development. The levels of resistin, adiponectin, uric acid (UA), fasting glucose, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triglycerides were analysed from serum samples. ROC curves and their corresponding areas under the curve (AUC) were utilised to establish the best cut-off values of biomarkers for distinguishing MetS patients and non-MetS patients. The logistic regression analysis was performed to predict the onset of MetS in patients with T2DM. T2DM patients with and without MetS showed significant differences in resistin/UA (p = 0.017), adiponectin/UA (p < 0.001) and adiponectin levels. The Resistin/UA ROC Curve yielded an AUC of 0.825 (p < 0.001), 86.7% sensitivity and 76.2% specificity at a cut-off point of 0.99.

This study aimed to investigate the functional connectivity (FC) patterns of pregenual ACC (pgACC) and anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC) in IBS patients with depressive symptoms (DEP-IBS). A whole-brain FC analysis was conducted using pgACC and aMCC as regions of interest in three groups: 28 DEP-IBS patients, 21 IBS patients without depressive symptoms (nDEP-IBS), and 36 matched healthy controls (HCs). Partial correlation and mediation analyses were performed between abnormal FC and clinical symptoms. The ability of aberrant FC to identify IBS and its psychiatric comorbidity was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. DEP-IBS patients exhibited increased pgACC-related FC in the left medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and aMCC-related FC in the right middle frontal gyrus, angular gyrus and cerebellum, while showing decreased aMCC-related FC in the right precentral gyrus, superior parietal gyrus and precuneus. Both patient groups demonstrated increased FC between aMCC and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dlPFC), effectively distinguishing them from HCs (AUC = 0.755). The FC between pgACC and left mPFC partially mediated the relationship between gastrointestinal and depressive symptoms, effectively distinguishing DEP-IBS from nDEP-IBS patients (AUC = 0.808).

Patients in the NACE group exhibited higher frailty (P < 0.001), increased dependency (P < 0.001), and poorer nutritional status (P <0.05) compared to those in the non-NACE group. The FS [OR (95% CI) = 2.03 (1.39-2.95), P < 0.001] and PNI [OR (95% CI) = 0.64 (0.41-0.99), P < 0.05] scores emerged as independent predictors of NACE in a multivariable model including age, sex, and traditional cardiovascular risk factors. This model demonstrated high discriminatory power [AUC (95% CI) = 0.834 (0.768-0.899), P < 0.001] for NACE. Frailty and nutritional status could significantly contribute to the stratification and identification of older adults with ACS who are at risk of developing in-hospital complications.","2025","European journal of cardiovascular nursing"

In this study, we aimed to identify protein biomarkers and develop a predictive model for postoperative delirium in older patients undergoing cardiac surgery. SomaScan analysis of 1305 proteins in the plasma from 57 older adults undergoing cardiac surgery requiring cardiopulmonary bypass was conducted to define delirium-specific protein signatures at baseline (preoperative baseline timepoint [PREOP]) and postoperative day 2 (POD2). Selected proteins were validated in 115 patients using the Enzyme-Linked Lectin Assay (ELLA) multiplex immunoassay platform. Proteins were combined with clinical and demographic variables to build multivariable models that estimate the risk of postoperative delirium and bring light to the underlying pathophysiology. Of the 115 patients, 21 (18.3%) developed delirium after surgery. The SomaScan proteome screening evidenced differential expression of 115 and 85 proteins in delirious patients compared to nondelirious preoperatively and at POD2, respectively ( P < .05). Following biological and methodological criteria, 12 biomarker candidates (Tukey's fold change [|tFC|] >1.4, Benjamini-Hochberg [BH]- P < .01) were selected for ELLA multiplex validation. Statistical analyses of model fit resulted in the combination of age, sex, and 3 proteins (angiopoietin-2; C-C motif chemokine 5; and metalloproteinase inhibitor 1; area under the curve [AUC] = 0.829) as the best performing predictive model for delirium. Analyses of pathways showed that delirium-associated proteins are involved in inflammation, glial dysfunction, vascularization, and hemostasis. Our results support the identification of patients at higher risk of developing delirium after cardiac surgery using a multivariable model that combines demographic and physiological features, also bringing light to the role of immune and vascular dysregulation as underlying mechanisms.","2025","Anesthesia and analgesia"

Prevention strategies exist but require accurate risk prediction. This study aimed to develop and validate a machine learning model for predicting incident CVD among patients with mental illness using routine clinical data from electronic health records. A cohort study was conducted using data from 74,880 patients with 1.6 million psychiatric service contacts in the Central Denmark Region from 2013 to 2021. Two machine learning models (XGBoost and regularised logistic regression) were trained on 85% of the data from six hospitals using 234 potential predictors. The best-performing model was externally validated on the remaining 15% of patients from another three hospitals. CVD was defined as myocardial infarction, stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. The best-performing model (hyperparameter-tuned XGBoost) demonstrated acceptable discrimination, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.84 on the training set and 0.74 on the validation set. It identified high-risk individuals 2.5 years before CVD events. For the psychiatric service contacts in the top 5% of predicted risk, the positive predictive value was 5%, and the negative predictive value was 99%. The model issued at least one positive prediction for 39% of patients who developed CVD. A machine learning model can accurately predict CVD risk among patients with mental illness using routinely collected electronic health record data. A decision support system building on this approach may aid primary CVD prevention in this high-risk population.","2025","European psychiatry : the journal of the Association of European Psychiatrists"

However, accurate non-invasive methods for distinguishing between PLGC and GC are currently lacking. This study therefore aimed to develop a risk prediction model by machine learning and deep learning techniques to aid the early diagnosis of GC. In this study, a total of 2229 subjects were recruited from nine tertiary hospitals between October 2022 and November 2023. We designed a comprehensive questionnaire, identified statistically significant factors, and created a web-based column chart. Then, a risk prediction model was subsequently developed by machine learning techniques. In addition, a tongue image-based risk prediction model was established by deep learning algorithms. Based on logistic regression analysis, a dynamic web-based nomogram was developed and it is freely accessible at: https://yz6677.shinyapps.io/GC67/ . Then, the prediction model was established using ten different machine learning algorithms and the Random Forest (RF) model achieved the highest accuracy at 85.65%. According with the predictive results, the top 10 key risk factors were age, traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) constitution type, tongue coating color, tongue color, irregular meals, pickled food, greasy fur, over-hot eating habit, anxiety and sleep onset latency. These factors are all significant risk indicators for the progression of PLGC patients to GC patients. Subsequently, the Swin Transformer architecture was used to develop a tongue image-based model for predicting the risk for progression of PLGC. The verification set showed an accuracy of 73.33% and an area under curve (AUC) greater than 0.8 across all models.

Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) technology enables the detection of substances that are visually indistinguishable to the human eye, providing a noninvasive approach with extensive applications in medical diagnostics. The objective of this study is to develop and validate a digital, noninvasive oral diagnostic model for patients with HFpEF using HSI combined with various machine learning algorithms. Between April 2023 and August 2023, a total of 140 patients were recruited from Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University to serve as the training and internal testing groups for this study. Subsequently, from August 2024 to September 2024, an additional 35 patients were enrolled from Three Gorges University and Yichang Central People's Hospital to constitute the external testing group. After preprocessing to ensure image quality, spectral and textural features were extracted from the images. We extracted 25 spectral bands from each patient image and obtained 8 corresponding texture features to evaluate the performance of 28 machine learning algorithms for their ability to distinguish control participants from participants with HFpEF. The model demonstrating the optimal performance in both internal and external testing groups was selected to construct the HFpEF diagnostic model. Hyperspectral bands significant for identifying participants with HFpEF were identified for further interpretative analysis. The Shapley Additive Explanations (SHAP) model was used to provide analytical insights into feature importance. Participants were divided into a training group (n=105), internal testing group (n=35), and external testing group (n=35), with consistent baseline characteristics across groups. Among the 28 algorithms tested, the random forest algorithm demonstrated superior performance with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.884 and an accuracy of 82.9% in the internal testing group, as well as an AUC of 0.812 and an accuracy of 85.7% in the external testing group. For model interpretation, we used the top 25 features identified by the random forest algorithm. The SHAP analysis revealed discernible distinctions between control participants and participants with HFpEF, thereby validating the diagnostic model's capacity to accurately identify participants with HFpEF. This noninvasive and efficient model facilitates the identification of individuals with HFpEF, thereby promoting early detection, diagnosis, and treatment.

An early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and prognosis. Traditional invasive procedures such as image-guided prostate biopsy often cause discomfort and complications, deterring some patients from undergoing these necessary tests. This study aimed to explore the feasibility and clinical value of using ultrasound super-resolution imaging (US SRI) for non-invasively assessing the microvessel characteristics of prostate lesion. This study included 127 patients with prostate lesion who presented at Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University between November 2023 and June 2024 were included in this study. All the patients underwent transrectal US (TRUS), contrast-enhanced US (CEUS), and US SRI. CEUS parameters of time-intensity curve (TIC): arrival time (AT), rising time (RT), time to peak (TTP), peak intensity (PKI), falling time (FT), mean transit time (MTT), ascending slope (AS), descending slope (DS), D/A slope ratio (SR), and area under the TIC (AUC). US SRI parameters: microvessel density (MVD), microvessel diameter (D), microvessel velocity (V), microvessel tortuosity (T), and fractal number (FN), were analyzed and compared between prostate benign and malignant lesion. The tumor markers of prostate in the malignant group were all higher than those in the benign group, and the differences were statistically significant (P < 0.001). The TIC parameters of CEUS revealed that the PKI, AS, DS, and AUC were significantly higher in the malignant group than in the benign group (P < 0.001), whereas the RT, TTP and FT in the malignant group were significantly lower (P < 0.001). Malignant lesion exhibited significantly higher MVD, larger D, faster V, greater T, and more complex FN than benign lesion (P < 0.001). US SRI is a promising non-invasive imaging modality that can provide detailed microvessel characteristics of prostate lesion, offering an advancement in the differential diagnosis for prostate lesion. And, US SRI may be a valuable tool in clinical practice with its ability to display and quantify microvessel with high precision.","2025","Cancer imaging : the official publication of the International Cancer Imaging Society"

Hemiarthroplasty or osteosynthesis (extramedullary or intramedullary) is the primary treatment option for these fractures. However, within this fragile patient population many comorbidities, among others dementia, are seen. Therefore, predicting patients with a high mortality risk after surgery may lead to adopting alternative treatment options with less risks. This paper proposes a new model to distinguish patients with high postoperative mortality risk with adequate follow-up time in combination with a wide set of useful and available variables. Patients treated with hemiarthroplasty or osteosynthesis for proximal femoral fractures were studied, with a follow-up period of 6 months. Patients who died within this follow-up period were compared to survivors, and predicting variables were assessed in logistic regression: The Zuyderland Hip Inference for Survival and Lifetime Expectancy (ZHISLE). The model was validated internally against a held-out dataset. Furthermore, the model performance was compared against the Almelo Hip Fracture Score (AHFS) on the same sample. Out of 2463 patients undergoing surgical treatment for proximal femoral fractures, 415 (16.8%) died within 183 days. Predictors for early mortality included old age, male sex, high heartbeat, KATZ-ADL and GFI scores, C-reactive protein and urea concentrations and low albumin concentration. Our model showed satisfactory predictive and discriminatory power (ROC curve = 0.81). Internal validation was good (ROC in validation dataset = 0.81), and better than the AHFS (ROC = 0.57). The ZHISLE model demonstrates good predictive power concerning mortality risk for old patients with a proximal femoral fracture. The model could benefit patients by indicating if a conservative, non-invasive policy might be a better option for those patients.","2025","Hip international : the journal of clinical and experimental research on hip pathology and therapy"

Purpose To assess the prognostic value of ischemic LGE features to predict all-cause mortality in ischemic cardiomyopathy. Materials and Methods This study is a secondary analysis of a prospective dual-center trial of participants with ischemic cardiomyopathy and left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) under 50% referred for viability assessment using cardiac MRI between 2008 and 2022. The LGE granularity parameters (extent of ischemic LGE, transmurality, location, and associated midwall LGE) assessed by cardiac MRI experts were compared with traditional prognosticators of adverse events in ischemic cardiomyopathy (age, sex, body mass index, diabetes, smoking, dyslipidemia, heart failure hospitalization, atrial fibrillation, renal failure, known myocardial infarction, and LVEF). The primary outcome was all-cause mortality. Predictive value was evaluated using Cox regression analysis and assessed using time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curves at 10 years. The cardiac MRI LGE score was developed using LGE granularity parameters. Results Among 6082 participants (mean age, 64.5 years ± 11.8 [SD]; 4419 men), 3591 had ischemic LGE. During a median follow-up of 9.0 years (IQR, 6.6-11.5 years), 652 participants died. The presence of ischemic LGE was strongly associated with mortality (hazard ratio, 3.45 [99.5% CI: 2.55, 4.67]; P < .001). In the group with ischemic LGE, the LGE granularity model combining these LGE features showed the best predictive value above traditional prognosticators and ischemic LGE extent to predict all-cause mortality (area under the receiving operating characteristic curve [AUC] at 10 years, 0.89 [99.5% CI: 0.89, 0.90] vs 0.83 [99.5% CI: 0.83, 0.84]; P < .001). The cardiac MRI LGE score performed well in participants with ischemic LGE (AUC at 10 years, 0.87 [99.5% CI: 0.85, 0.90]).

The recent progress in large language models (LLMs) might introduce a new useful tool in interpreting radiology reports. This study aims to explore the use of the LLM to classify radiology reports and generate labels. These labels will be utilized then to train a CNN to detect ankle fractures to evaluate the effectiveness of using automatically generated labels. We used the open-weight LLM Mixtral-8×7B-Instruct-v0.1 to classify radiology reports of ankle x-ray images. The generated labels were used to train a CNN to recognize ankle fractures. The model's accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curve were used for evaluation. Using common prompt engineering techniques, a prompt was found that reached an accuracy of 92% on a test dataset. By parsing all radiology reports using the LLM, a training dataset of 15,896 images and labels was created. Using this dataset, a CNN was trained, which achieved an accuracy of 89.5% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.926 on a test dataset. Our classification model based on labels generated with a large language model achieved high accuracy. This performance is comparable to models trained with manually labeled data, demonstrating the potential of language models in automating the labeling process. Large language models can be used to reliably detect pathologies in radiology reports.

Pretreatment dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) MRI and ultra-multi-b-value (UMB) diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) data were acquired in BC patients who received NAT followed by surgery at two centers. Hyper-fused radiomic features (RFs) and conventional RFs were extracted from DCE-MRI or UMB-DWI. After feature selection, the following models were built using logistic regression and the retained RFs: hyper-fused model, conventional model, and compound model that integrates the hyper-fused and conventional RFs. The output probability of each model was used to generate a radiomic signature. The model's performance was quantified by the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC). Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify variables (clinicopathological variables and the generated radiomic signatures) associated with pCR. The training/external test set (center 1/2) included 547/295 women. The hyper-fused models (AUCs=0.81-0.85) outperformed (p<0.05) the conventional models (AUCs=0.74-0.80) in predicting pCR. The compound models (AUCs=0.88-0.93) outperformed (p<0.05) the hyper-fused models and conventional models for pCR prediction. The hyper-fused radiomic signatures (odds ratios=5.70-12.98; p<0.05) and compound radiomic signatures (odds ratios=1.57-7.71; p<0.05) were independently associated with pCR. These are true for the training and external test sets. The hyper-fused radiomic approach had significantly better performance for predicting pCR to NAT than the conventional radiomic approach, and the hyper-fused RFs provided incremental discrimination of pCR beyond the conventional RFs.

In the present study, we explored the quantitative association of wastewater viral load and clinically confirmed cases in various areas of the village. From July 14 through September 8, 2021, 360 passive samples and 329 grab samples were collected from seven distinct areas within the village through manholes and examined for SARS-CoV-2 RNA by the Efficient and Practical virus Identification System with Enhanced Sensitivity (EPISENS) methods. The detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in passive and grab samples showed a significant association (P < 0.001, φ = 0.32, chi-square test), with passive sampling showing higher positive rate. Based on the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analysis on the wastewater viral load and clinically confirmed cases, the most sensitive cutoff point was judged to be the limit of quantification (LOQ) for the passive three-day samples. Under this optimal condition, the sensitivity and specificity were 0.78 and 0.40, respectively. The present study demonstrated the effectiveness of passive sampling for building-level wastewater surveillance based on the quantitative analysis of wastewater viral load and reported cases.

We experimentally demonstrate that this EC biosensor exhibits ultra-high sensitivity (LOD as low as 135 aM), a wide linear range from 1 fM to 1 nM, good reproducibility and stability. Meanwhile, it can determine ORAOV 1 in human saliva samples with good anti-interference and well-pleasing recovery rates.

To develop and validate a model using available information at the time of faecal immunochemical testing (FIT) in primary care to improve selection of symptomatic patients for CRC investigations. We included all adults (≥ 18 years) referred to Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust between 2018 and 2022 with symptoms of suspected CRC who had a FIT. Predicted 1-year CRC diagnosis were calculated, and externally validated, using Cox proportional hazards modelling with selected multiple fractional polynomial transformations for age, faecal haemoglobin concentration (f-Hb) value, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), platelet count and sex. At a CRC risk threshold of 0.6% (equivalent to f-Hb = 10 μg Hb/g (μg/g)) overall performance of the validated model across age strata using Harrell's C index was ≥ 0.91% (overall C-statistic 93%, 95% CI 92%-95%) with acceptable calibration. Using this model yields similar numbers of detected and missed cancers, but requires ~20% fewer investigations than a f-Hb ≥ 10 μg/g strategy. For approximately 100,000 people per year with symptoms of suspected CRC, we predict it might save > 4500 colonoscopies with no evidence that more cancers would be missed if we used our model compared to using FIT f-Hb ≥ 10 μg/g. Including age, sex, MCV, platelets and f-Hb in a survival analysis model to predict the risk of CRC yields greater diagnostic utility than a simple binary cut off f-Hb ≥ 10 μg/g.","2025","Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics"

We assessed the diagnostic performance of a comprehensive CCTA-based approach compared with the invasive reference, which includes invasive coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and fractional flow reserve, for detecting CAV. This was a multicenter prospective study including 37 patients with HTx who underwent CCTA, invasive coronary angiography, intravascular ultrasound, and fractional flow reserve. The comprehensive CCTA-based approach included quantitative and qualitative plaque analysis and functional assessment by fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography. CAV was diagnosed based on invasive coronary angiography (International Society for Heart and Lung Transplantation criteria) and intravascular ultrasound. Univariable logistic regression analysis was performed to test CCTA-derived predictors of CAV. The area under the curve and accuracy indicators were calculated to evaluate the performance and best cutoffs of CCTA predictors of CAV. The median interval between CCTA and HTx was 5 years. Among the 37 recipients, 23 (62.2%) were diagnosed with CAV. The integration of diameter stenosis and plaque morphology (including plaque burden at minimum lumen area >42% and percent atheroma volume >23%) at CCTA yielded the highest diagnostic performance (accuracy, 84%; sensitivity, 83%; specificity, 86%). The integration of ∆fractional flow reserve derived from coronary computed tomography trans-vessel gradient led to increased sensitivity, albeit with decreased specificity and overall accuracy. The noninvasive approach was associated with a lower contrast and radiation dose, compared with the invasive approach. A noninvasive strategy based on CCTA is accurate for managing patients with HTx. CCTA might be considered the preferred imaging modality for annual CAV surveillance after the first year post-HTx.","2025","Circulation. Cardiovascular imaging"

This include data from systemic monitoring-mean arterial pressure (MAP), arterial carbon dioxide tension (PaCO2), arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2), hemoglobin levels (Hb), and temperature-as well as neurological monitoring-intracranial pressure (ICP), cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP), and transcranial Doppler (TCD) velocities. We hypothesized that these parameters alone were not sufficient to assess the risk of cerebral ischemia. We conducted a retrospective, single-center study of patients admitted in our ICU between 2015 and 2021. Patients with ABI and multimodal neuromonitoring were included. ABI included traumatic brain injury (TBI), subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH), intracranial hemorrhage and ischemic stroke. The relationship between jugular venous oxygen saturation (SjvO2) and cerebral perfusion parameters was analyzed. Patients were categorized into two groups based on SjvO2, with a threshold of 60% used to define cerebral ischemia. We compared the parameters used to optimize cerebral perfusion between groups and their diagnosis accuracy for cerebral ischemia was evaluated. Univariable and multivariable analyses were performed to assess the association between the guideline-recommended therapeutic targets and the risk of cerebral ischemia. 601 evaluations from 96 patients with simultaneous ICP, SjvO2 and TCD were analyzed. Poor relationships were found between SjvO2 and the parameters of cerebral perfusion. TCD flow velocities and PaCO2 were lower in the cerebral ischemia group while MAP, ICP and CPP were not different between groups. Most ischemic episodes occurred despite ICP < 22 mmHg and CPP ≥ 60 mmHg. For the diagnosis of cerebral ischemia, only TCD parameters and PaCO2 were associated with an area under the curve (AUC) > 0.5 but with a low accuracy.

However, the determination that a patient is in the terminal phase of life, a prerequisite for the withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment, lacks objective criteria. This study aimed to evaluate whether hyperlactatemia could serve as a reliable objective indicator for determining the terminal phase. In this retrospective cohort study, we included 73,927 patients admitted to our institution from 2018 to 2023 who had at least one blood lactate measurement. We collected data on the highest blood lactate level measured during hospitalization, mortality, medical department, and intensive care unit (ICU) details. The primary endpoint was 30-day mortality, and we analyzed how well the highest lactate level during hospitalization predicted 30-day mortality across different age groups, medical departments, and ICUs. Among the patients, 5493 died within 30 days of the maximum lactate measurement. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) for predicting 30-day mortality based on the maximum lactate level was 0.870 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.865-0.875) in all patients, indicating high accuracy. Setting the cutoff for the maximum lactate level at 20 mmol/L resulted in a precision of 87% and specificity of 99.8%. Subgroup analyses by age, medical department, and ICU yielded consistent results. Severe hyperlactatemia during hospitalization showed high precision and specificity for predicting 30-day mortality across various patient groups. These findings suggest that hyperlactatemia could serve as an objective auxiliary indicator for determining the terminal phase, potentially improving consistency in end-of-life decision-making in clinical practice.","2025","Science progress"

Herein, a wash-free and separation-free miRNA biosensor based on photoexcited electro-driven reactive oxygen channeling analysis (LEOCA) is developed to solve the high-fidelity detection in physiological samples. In the presence of miRNA, nanoacceptors (ultrasmall-size polydopamine, uPDA) are responsively assembled on the surface of nanodonors (zirconium metal-organic framework, ZrMOF) to form core-satellite aggregates. The produced lifetime-constraint singlet oxygen upon light irradiation is captured by the catechol of constrained uPDA, and the oxidized quinone is immediately electro-reduced to the catechol at transient collision process on the electrode, resulting in a cascade electron transfer and amplified current. Thereby, the nanosensor exhibits a low detection limit (1.1 fM), and high reproducibility (relative standard deviation of 2.0%). Compared with quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR), the clinical accuracy (area under the curve value) is significantly increased from 0.75 to 0.93 in distinguishing breast cancer patients from healthy donors. This study demonstrates an inspiration on the synergy of the reactive oxygen channeling between nanodonor/nanoacceptor and the synchronous electron transfer cascade on the electrode to solve the bottleneck problem of detecting unprocessed clinical samples in a sample-in-answer-out manner.","2025","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)"

An independent cohort was developed with 28 patients from a third center, which comprises 70 BM lesions. All patients underwent T1-weighted contrast-enhanced (T1CE) and T2-weighted (T2W) MRI scans before treatment. Radiomics features were extracted from tumor active area (TAA) and peritumoral edema area (PEA) selected using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) to construct radiomics signatures (Rads). The Rads were further integrated with VPE to build combined models for predicting the metastatic type of BM. Performance of the models were assessed through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Rads derived from TAA and PEA both showed predictive power for identifying the origin of BM. The developed combined models generated the best performance in the training (AUCs, lung cancer [LC]/non-lung cancer [NLC] vs. small cell lung cancer [SCLC]/non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC] vs. breast cancer [BC]/gastrointestinal cancer [GIC], 0.870 vs. 0.946 vs. 0.886), internal validation (area under the receiver operating characteristic curves [AUCs], LC/NLC vs. SCLC/NSCLC vs. BC/GIC, 0.786 vs. 0.863 vs. 0.836) and external validation (AUCs, LC /NLC vs. SCLC/NSCLC vs. BC/GIC, 0.805 vs. 0.877 vs. 0.774) cohort.

We also constructed a calibration plot to assess the fitness of each model. Regarding the analysis of the 12-month survival status, none of the risk models demonstrated AUC values higher than the modified albumin-bilirubin (mALBI) grade. In the NRI analysis, only the IMmunotherapy with AFP, BCLC staging, mALBI, and DCP evaluation (IMABALI-De score) exhibited a statistically significant improvement compared with the mALBI grade (p = 0.009). While the modified albumin-bilirubin grade (mALF) score and prognostic nutritional index (PNI) did not exhibit significant differences compared to the mALBI grade (p = 0.3 and 0.2, respectively), the remaining risk models were inferior to the mALBI grade. In the relative IDI analysis, none of the risk models showed a significant improvement compared with the mALBI grade. The calibration plot of the PNI was unsatisfactory. The results for the 18-month survival status were consistent with those for the 12-month survival status. A time-dependent ROC analysis demonstrated that both the mALBI grade and the mALBI-based model showed consistent performance over time.

While the exact cause of ALS is not fully understood, a combination of genetic and environmental factors is believed to contribute to its development. Growth arrest-specific 6 (Gas6), a vitamin K-dependent protein, has been recognized to enhance oligodendrocytes and neurons' survival and is associated with different kinds of (neuro)inflammatory conditions. Therefore, we aimed to determine a possible implication of Gas6 in ALS phenotype and progression by evaluating the value of circulating Gas6 and its soluble receptors (sAxl, sMer, sTyro-3) in ALS patients. We conducted a prospective observational study including 65 ALS patients and measured the circulating serum levels of Gas6, sAxl, sMer, soluble Tyro-3 (sTyro-3), and neurofilaments (NfLs). In our ALS cohort, lower serum levels of Gas6 and concomitantly higher levels of NfLs were associated with a more aggressive disease, expressed with bulbar phenotype (p-value for Gas6 = 0.03) and faster progression (p-value for Gas6 = 0.03). Also, serum Gas6 was able to distinguish (area under the curve, cut-off 13.70 ng/mL, sensitivity 69.57%, specificity 72.72%) between fast and slow progressors.

One open question is whether a hospital should utilize a mortality model trained from a diverse nationwide dataset or use a model developed primarily from their local hospital data. To compare performance of a single-hospital, 30-day all-cause mortality model against an established national benchmark on the task of mortality prediction. We developed a single-hospital mortality prediction model using 9975 consecutive inpatient admissions at the Department of Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Healthcare System from July 26, 2018, to September 30, 2021, and compared performance against an established national model with similar features. Both the single-hospital model and the national model placed each patient in one of five prediction bins: < 2.5%, 2.5-5%, 5-10%, 10-30%, and ≥ 30% risks of 30-day mortality. Evaluation metrics included receiver operator characteristic area under the curve (ROC AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and balanced accuracy. Final comparisons were made between the single-hospital model trained on the full training set and the national model for both metrics and prediction overlap. With sufficiently large training sets of 2720 or greater inpatient admissions, there was no statistically significant difference between the performances of the national model (ROC AUC 0.89, 95%CI [0.858, 0.919]) and single-hospital model (ROC AUC 0.878, 95%CI [0.84, 0.912]). For the 89 mortality events in the test set, the single-hospital model agreed with the national model risk assessment or an adjacent risk assessment in 92.1% of the encounters.

The patients were divided into training and validation cohorts in a 7:3 ratio. Relevant risk factors influencing patient prognosis were identified, and a nomogram model was developed to predict stenosis-free survival rates at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months. The model's accuracy was assessed by calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), and its predictive performance was validated in the test group. The baseline data comparison between the training and validation groups revealed no significant differences, ensuring the comparability of the groups. Cox regression analysis identified that age, history of fistula or not, stenosis severity, and balloon diameter were independent risk factors influencing stenosis-free survival in patients with BES. The area under AUC for the nomogram prediction model of stenosis-free survival at 3, 6, 12, and 24 months was 0.77, 0.81, 0.85, and 0.83, respectively, in the training group, and 0.74, 0.80, 0.84, and 0.83, respectively, in the validation group.

A single-center, retrospective cohort study was performed of patients who underwent primary TJA from January 2016 to December 2021. The 90-day preoperative albumin, prealbumin, and total lymphocyte count were collected. Outcome measures were PJI, WC, readmission, and return to the operating room. Youden's index (YI) and Receiver operator characteristic curves were used to determine optimal cutoff points. Multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for potential confounders, including body mass index, age, and the Charlson comorbidity index. There were 1,575 patients included in the study. The mGNRI had the greatest accuracy (area under the curve = 0.633; optimal cutoff point = 92.8) in predicting postoperative adverse outcomes. Complication rates were significantly higher in the low mGNRI group (≤ 92.8). When controlled for body mass index, Charlson comorbidity index, and age, the odds of PJI, WC, readmission, and reoperation in patients who had low mGNRI were 6.61 (P = 0.005), 3.04 (P = 0.021), 2.25 (P = 0.020), and 2.75 (P = 0.024), respectively. The mGNRI is an easy-to-calculate nutritional index and an excellent predictor of postoperative complications following TJA. The mGNRI outperformed Geriatric Nutritional Risk index, Maastricht index, and Onodera's Prognostic Nutritional Index in predicting postoperative complications. Our results suggest that patients who fall below the mGNRI threshold of 92.8 should be carefully considered for nutritional optimization prior to TJA.","2025","The Journal of arthroplasty"

This platform provides comprehensive services for online PPI model training, PPI and site prediction, and prediction of interactions with proteins associated with highly prevalent cancers. In our Homo sapiens test set for PPI prediction, PPI-CoAttNet achieved an AUC of 0.9841 and an F1 score of 0.9440, outperforming most state-of-the-art models. Additionally, these results are generated in real time, delivering outcomes within minutes. We also evaluated PPI-CoAttNet for downstream tasks, including novel E3 ligase scoring, demonstrating outstanding accuracy. We believe that this tool will empower researchers, especially those without computational expertise, to leverage AI for accelerating drug development.","2025","Journal of chemical information and modeling"

The importance of delineating a threshold to indicate clinically meaningful changes perceived by a patient is well acknowledged, yet the influence of patient-specific factors on MCID has not been fully elucidated. Patients with CRS (n = 221) presenting to a tertiary care practice reported their change in disease burden with anchor questions following CRS-directed medical treatment. Baseline sociodemographics, pertinent history, and comorbid conditions, as well as pre- and post-treatment SNOT-22 scores were also collected. Adjusted logistic regression was utilized to determine the factors influencing MCID. Among the 221 patients, 43.9% (n = 97) reported improvement following medical treatment. Gender, education level, depression, and migraine were identified as significant factors influencing perceived improvement. Our predictive model, incorporating these variables, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.818 (95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.762, 0.875), with a sensitivity of 74.4% and specificity of 77.9%. Changes in SNOT-22 scores were not strongly associated with perceived improvement in patients with depression (odds ratio [OR] = 1.06; 95% CI = 0.98, 1.14; p = 0.140). Conversely, patients with migraines perceived more pronounced improvements or deteriorations at the extremes of SNOT-22 score changes (OR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.76, 0.93; p = 0.001). Our findings underscore the substantial impact of patient-specific sociodemographics and comorbidities on the calculation of MCID values for the SNOT-22. This study advances our understanding of variability in MCID and demonstrates the complex milieu of factors affecting patients' perceived clinical outcomes.","2025","International forum of allergy & rhinology"

Somatic cancer driver mutations identified through large-scale tumor sequencing studies often impact genes that are also associated with rare Mendelian disorders. The use of cancer mutation data to aid in the interpretation of germline missense variants, regardless of whether the gene is associated with a hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome or a non-cancer-related developmental disorder, has not been systematically assessed. We extracted putative cancer driver missense mutations from the Cancer Hotspots database and annotated them as germline variants, including presence/absence and classification in ClinVar. We trained two supervised learning models (logistic regression and random forest) to predict variant classifications of germline missense variants in ClinVar using Cancer Hotspot data (training dataset). The performance of each model was evaluated with an independent test dataset generated in part from searching public and private genome-wide sequencing datasets from ~1.5 million individuals. Of the 2,447 cancer mutations, 691 corresponding germline variants had been previously classified in ClinVar: 426 (61.6%) as likely pathogenic/pathogenic, 261 (37.8%) as uncertain significance, and 4 (0.6%) as likely benign/benign. The odds ratio for a likely pathogenic/pathogenic classification in ClinVar was 28.3 (95% confidence interval: 24.2-33.1, p < 0.001), compared with all other germline missense variants in the same 216 genes. Both supervised learning models showed high correlation with pathogenicity assessments in the training dataset. There was high area under precision-recall curve values (0.847 and 0.829) and area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values (0.821 and 0.774) for logistic regression and random forest models, respectively, when applied to the test dataset. With the use of cancer and germline datasets and supervised learning techniques, our study shows that cancer mutation data can be leveraged to improve the interpretation of germline missense variation potentially causing rare Mendelian disorders.","2025","PLoS genetics"

Correlation analyses were performed on the significant differential lipids. Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression and binary logistic regression analyses were performed to find possible biomarkers. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to evaluate the diagnostic performance of biomarkers. The serum lipid profile of women with APS was significantly different from that of healthy controls. After statistical analysis and database matching, 12 lipids were found to be significantly different between the two groups, with the most obvious differences being triacylglycerols and phosphatidylcholines. LASSO regression and binary logistic regression models revealed that PC (17:0/22:6) and ACar (17:3) may be serum biomarkers of APS. ROC curve analysis shows that PC (17:0/22:6) and ACar (17:3) combined gave an area under the curve of 0.865 for the diagnosis of APS.

Identifying high-risk sIAD cases that exhibit symptoms and are likely to progress is crucial for treatment decision-making. This study aimed to develop a model relying on circulating biomarkers to discriminate symptomatic sIADs. The study prospectively collected sIAD tissues and corresponding serums from January 2020 to December 2022 as the discovery cohort. Symptomatic sIADs were defined as those with mass effect, hemorrhagic, or ischemic stroke. A stratification model was developed using the machine-learning algorithm within the derivation cohort (a cross-sectional cohort including from January 2018 to August 2022) and validated within the validation cohort (a longitudinal cohort including from January 2017 to April 2023). In the discovery cohort (n = 10, 5 symptomatic), analyses of tissues and serums revealed 15 proteins and 2 cytokines with significance between symptomatic and asymptomatic sIADs. Among these biomarkers, six proteins and one cytokine, participating in the immune response and inflammatory-related pathways, have a good consistency in expression level between sIAD tissues and serums. In the derivation cohort (n = 181, 77 symptomatic), a model incorporating these 7 biomarkers was highly discriminative of symptomatic sIADs (area under curve [AUC], 0.95). This model performed well in predicting the occurrence of sIAD-related symptoms in the validation cohort (n = 84, 26 symptomatic) with an AUC of 0.88.

The aim was to evaluate the short-term and long-term outcomes of patients who underwent liver resection for large HCC, eventually drawing prediction models for short-term and long-term outcomes. 1710 large HCC patients were recruited and randomly divided into the training (n = 1140) and validation (n = 570) cohorts in a 2:1 ratio. Independent risk factors were identified by regression model and used to establish three nomograms for surgical risk, overall survival (OS), and recurrence-free survival (RFS) in the training cohort. Model performances were assessed by discrimination and calibration. The three models were also compared with six other staging systems. Platelet (PLT), gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase (GGT), albumin-bilirubin (ALBI) grade, blood transfusion and loss, resection margin, tumor size, and tumor number were established in a nomogram to evaluate surgical risk ( https://largehcc.shinyapps.io/largehcc-morbidity/ ). The model had a good prediction capability with a C-index of 0.764 and 0.773 in the training and validation cohorts. Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), resection margin, tumor size, tumor number, microvascular invasion, Edmondson-Steiner grade, tumor capsular, and satellite nodules were considered to construct a prognostic nomogram to predict the 1-, 3- and 5-year OS ( https://largehcc.shinyapps.io/largehcc-os/ ). The C-index of the model was 0.709 and 0.702 for the training and validation cohorts.

Despite correct localization, some remain refractory to intervention, resulting in substantial long-term medical complications. We aim to identify risk factors associated with a refractory outcome. This is a retrospective cohort of 44 TIO patients diagnosed from 1998-2023 who underwent targeted intervention following successfully localization. Cure was defined as maintenance of normophosphatemia without supplementation for >1 month, maintained at last follow-up. 29 patients achieved cure and 15 had a refractory outcome. On univariate cox regression, HR for predicting cure was 3.43 (95%CI 1.45-8.11, p=0.005) for patients diagnosed after 2013 (compared to before), and that for a negative surgical tumor margin was 2.56 (95%CI 1.20-5.45, p=0.015) compared to positive/unspecified margins. After adjustment for year of diagnosis, tumors originating from soft tissue (HR 2.72 versus bone, 95%CI 1.22-6.09, p=0.015) or located outside the spine (HR 0.22 for spine versus non-spine, 95%CI 0.05-0.96, p=0.043) had higher chances of cure. Size of tumor, age, gender, or baseline biochemistry including levels of FGF23, phosphorus, 1,25(OH)2D or ALP were not predictive of cure. Post-procedural FGF23 was the best biochemical marker of cure (AUC 0.899, 95%CI 0.764-1.00, p < 0.001). Tumors diagnosed within the past decade with clear resection margins had more favorable prognoses. With regards to tumoral factors, baseline biochemistry was uninformative in predicting cure, while bone and/or spine localizations were associated with a refractory outcome.","2025","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism"

We aimed to develop a predictive model for Cis-AKI using patient clinical information based on an interpretable machine learning algorithm. This single-center retrospective study included hospitalized patients aged ≥ 18 years who received the first course of cisplatin chemotherapy from January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2020, at Nagoya City University Hospital. Cis-AKI-positive patients were defined using the serum creatinine criteria of the Kidney Disease Improving Global Outcomes guideline within 14 days of the last day of cisplatin administration in the first course. Patients who received cisplatin but did not develop AKI were considered negative. The CatBoost classification model was constructed with 29 explanatory variables, including laboratory values, concomitant medications, medical history, and cisplatin administration information. In total, 1253 patients were included, of whom 119 developed Cis-AKI (9.5%). The median time of AKI onset was 7 days, and the interquartile range was 5-8 days. The mean ± standard deviation of the total cisplatin dose in the initial treatment was 77.9 ± 27.1 mg/m2 in Cis-AKI-positive patients and 69.3 ± 22.6 mg/m2 in Cis-AKI-negative patients. The predictive performance was an ROC-AUC of 0.78. Model interpretation using SHapley Additive exPlanations showed that concomitant use of intravenous magnesium preparations was negatively correlated with Cis-AKI, whereas loop diuretics were positively correlated. This suggests the need for magnesium preparations to prevent AKI, although the effects of diuretics may be small. Our model can predict Cis-AKI early and may be helpful for its avoidance.","2025","Clinical and translational science"

However, the shortcomings of deconjugation are the lack of standardized and fully validated hydrolysis protocols and the loss of information about the originally conjugated form of the steroids. This study aimed to evaluate the quality of the deconjugation process and investigate novel diagnostic biomarkers in urine without enzymatic hydrolysis. 24 h urine samples from 40 patients with ACC and 40 patients with ACA were analyzed by untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry both unmodified and after hydrolysis with arylsulfatase/glucuronidase from Helix pomatia. Both approaches were compared regarding the differentiation of ACC vs. ACA via ROC analyses and to evaluate the hydrolyzation efficiency of steroid conjugates. Steroid glucuronides were fully deconjugated, while some disulfates and all monosulfates were still largely detectable after enzymatic hydrolysis, suggesting incomplete and variable deconjugation. In unhydrolyzed urine, steroid monosulfates showed the best differentiation between ACC and ACA (highest AUC=0.983 for C21H32O6S, followed by its isomer and two isomers with the molecular formula C21H32O7S). Moreover, several disulfates were highly abundant and increased in ACC compared to ACA. This work highlights the limitations of hydrolyzing steroid conjugates before analysis and shows a possible superiority of a direct analysis approach compared to a hydrolysis approach from a methodological point of view and regarding diagnostic accuracy. Several steroid conjugates were found as promising diagnostic biomarkers for differentiation between ACC and ACA.","2025","Clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine"

Nevertheless, ideal quantitative or qualitative biomarkers for predicting a different response to biologics urgently need to be explored. We aim to identify potential biomarkers for predicting a good or poor response in patients with refractory CRSwNP. Patients received an endoscopic and radiological evaluation, a visual analogue scale (VAS) assessment, and a 22-item sinonasal outcome test (SNOT-22). Forty-eight biomarkers involving type 1 (T1), type 2 (T2), and type 3 (T3) inflammatory factors, chemokines, and remodeling factors were detected in nasal secretion and serum samples at baseline and after 24 weeks of omalizumab treatment. Eighteen patients with CRSwNP and 16 patients as control were enrolled. Patients with CRSwNP who received oamlizumab treatment with the SNOT-22 and VAS scores improved by 8.9 and 2 points in 72.22% and 50%, respectively. The nasal polyp score (NPS) and Lund-Mackay score were significantly improved in 55.56% of patients. The concentrations of T2 inflammatory biomarker, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF), T3 inflammatory biomarkers, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF), chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL)-1, and chemokine (C-C motif) ligand-20 (CCL-20), T1 inflammatory biomarker, IP-10 (CXCL-10), and granzyme B in nasal secretion and serum periostin were significantly decreased. Serum CCL-3 (AUC = 0.836) and CCL-4 (AUC = 0.909) levels predicted the improvement of SNOT-22 score, respectively. Serum IL-8 (AUC = 0.883) predicted poor improvement in nasal congestion score. Nasal secretion CXCL-1 (AUC = 0.812), GM-CSF (AUC = 0.813), IgE (AUC = 0.900) and IP-10 (AUC = 0.800) effectively predicted none or less improvement in nasal polyp score. Omalizumab remarkably affects inflammatory mediators in different pathways. CCL-3 and CCL-4 in serum and IgE, CXCL-1, GM-CSF, and IP-10 in nasal secretion may be considered as preferable biomarkers for predicting favorable or ineffective response to omalizumab therapy in patients with refractory CRSwNP comorbid with asthma, based on various clinical indicators.","2025","The World Allergy Organization journal"

BCR was defined as two consecutive PSA levels exceeding 0.2 ng/mL post-radical prostatectomy. Cox proportional hazards regression identified predictive variables for BCR. Subsequently, pathologic T stage, PSA level, positive surgical margin, extraprostatic extension, and seminal vesicle involvement were retained. A nomogram was constructed using R software to predict BCR. The model was evaluated using the C-index and calibration curves.

Three sepsis-related datasets (E-MTAB-4421 and E-MTAB-4451 as training sets and GSE185263 as a validation set) were collected, and differentially expressed m7G-related genes were analyzed between survivors and non-survivors. Lethality-related m7G signature genes were then screened using machine learning methods, followed by the construction of a survival recognition model. Additionally, differences in immune cell distribution were determined and differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between different subtypes were analyzed. Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was used to select important modules and related hub genes. In total, 10 differentially expressed m7G-related genes were identified between the survivors and non-survivors, and after further analysis, EIF4G3, EIF4E3, NSUN2, NUDT4, and GEMIN5 were identified as the optimal lethality-related m7G genes. A survival status diagnostic model was then constructed with a combined AUC of 0.678. Fifteen types of immune cells were significantly different between survivors and non-survivors. Sepsis samples were classified into two subtypes, with 22 types of immune cells showing significant differences. Subsequently, 1707 DEGs were identified between the two subtypes, which were significantly enriched in 91 GO terms and 16 KEGG pathways. Finally, the green module with |correlation| > 0.3 was found to be closely related to the subtypes and survival status; further, the top10 hub genes were obtained. The constructed survival status diagnostic model based on the five lethality-related m7G signature genes may help predict the survival status of patients, and the 10 hub genes obtained may be potential therapeutic targets for sepsis.","2025","Heliyon"

Research Design and Methods: Baseline 2-h oral glucose tolerance test data from the TrialNet Pathway to Prevention (TNPTP; n = 6190) and Diabetes Prevention Trial-Type 1 (DPT-1; n = 705) studies were used. Linear regression of area under the curve (AUC) glucose versus Index60 was performed to identify two fractions: dependent (dAUCGLU) or independent (iAUCGLU) of insulin secretion. Results: The lack of correlation (r = 0.06) of iAUCGLU and the inverse correlation of dAUCGLU (r = -0.59) with the first-phase insulin response from DPT-1 were consistent with the independent and dependent designations of the glucose fractions. Correlations of AUC C-peptide were inverse with dAUCGLU and positive with iAUCGLU (TNPTP: r = -0.72, r = 0.57; DPT-1: r = -0.56, r = 0.60). The explained variance of AUC C-peptide increased markedly after separating AUC glucose into its fractions (from 4% to 85% in TNPTP; from 1% to 67% in DPT-1). The independent fraction contributed more to the increased glycemia of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) than did the dependent fraction. Both dAUCGLU and iAUCGLU predicted IGT and type 1 diabetes (T1D) (P < 0.0001 for all). However, whereas dAUCGLU was more predictive of T1D (chi-square: 849 vs. 249), iAUCGLU was more predictive of IGT (chi-square: 451 vs. 176). Conclusions: A glucose fraction independent of insulin secretion was identified that was appreciable in autoantibody-positive individuals. It provides insight into the relation between glucose and C-peptide, contributes substantially to the glycemia of IGT, and predicts both T1D and IGT, particularly the latter.","2025","Diabetes technology & therapeutics"

The proteomic profile of normal tissues closely resembled that of para-carcinoma tissues while distinctly differing from that of tumors. Among the 68 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) identified between the tumor and normal tissues, WISP-1, ESM-1, and TFPI-2 showed the most pronounced alterations and exhibited relatively strong correlations. These markers also presented the highest AUC values for distinguishing between tissue types. Bioinformatic analysis of the DEPs revealed that the plasma membrane and the PI3K-AKT signaling pathway were among the most enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways. Furthermore, although TFPI-2 is typically recognized as a tumor suppressor, both Olink and enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analyses have demonstrated that its expression is significantly elevated in tumors compared with paired normal tissues. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to profile the proteome of intestinal tissue using the Olink technology. This work offers valuable insights into potential biomarkers and therapeutic targets for CRC, complementing the Olink profiling of circulating proteins.","2025","Journal of proteome research"

Some studies examine serum directly, while others focus on specific components like small extracellular vesicles (sEVs), which are lipid-bilayer encapsulated particles carrying a variety of molecular cargos. However, the diagnostic value of serum sEVs versus sEVs-depleted fractions (EV-free serum) for early cancer detection are unclear. In the study, size exclusion chromatography (SEC) is employed to separate serum from prostate cancer (PCa) suspects into sEVs-enriched fractions (EV) and EV-free serum. Metabolic fingerprints are obtained using ferric nanoparticle-assisted laser ablation/ionization mass spectroscopy (FeNPALDI-MS), revealing heterogeneity in metabolic composition. Eleven key metabolites are identified in EV and two in EV-free serum that differentiate PCa from benign prostatic hyperplasia. The EV key metabolites showed higher diagnostic value in PCa patients with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.76, p < 0.05 and improved diagnostic efficacy when combined with the prostate-specific antigen (PSA, AUC = 0.85).","2025","Small (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany)"

Ataxia and spasticity are usually predominant, but patients may also present with parkinsonism. We aimed to characterize substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) degeneration in SCA2 and 7 using neuromelanin-sensitive imaging. Ataxic and preataxic expansion carriers with SCA2 (n=15) and SCA7 (n=15) and healthy controls (n=10) were prospectively recruited. Volume and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) values of the SNc were extracted from neuromelanin-sensitive images. ROC curves were used to determine the metrics that best differentiated SCA participants. Correlations between imaging measurements, clinical variables, and plasma neurofilaments light chain (NfL) levels were investigated. SCA2 participants had lower SNR values in the SNc than controls (110.2 ± 1.3 versus 113.2 ± 1.4; p < 0.001) and those with SCA7 (112.5 ± 2.1; p < 0.01). SNR in SCA7 participants and controls did not differ. In ataxic patients, SNc volumes were lower in SCA2 (0.13 ± 0.04; p = 0.06) and SCA7 (0.10 ± 0.03, p = 0.02) patients compared to controls (0.17 ± 0.04). Signal decrease was detected at the preataxic stage in SCA2, but not in SCA7. SCA2 participants showed prominent involvement of the associative and limbic nigral territories. SNR discriminated ataxic and preataxic SCA2 participants from controls (AUC ≥0.94). SNc volume differentiated ataxic SCA7 participants from controls (AUC = 1), but not preataxic ones. In SCA7, correlations were observed between SNc volume and time to onset, CAG repeats, clinical severity scores, and NfL. Neuromelanin-sensitive imaging provides biomarkers of nigral degeneration in SCAs, detectable from the preataxic stage in SCA2, which could potentially serve as outcome measures in clinical trials.","2025","European journal of neurology"

Whether local immunoglobulin E (IgE) in induced sputum reflects asthma control status has not been investigated. Patients with asthma were classified as well controlled, partly controlled, and uncontrolled asthma (UCA) according to Global Initiative for Asthma 2022 guidelines. Lung function and fractional exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) were evaluated. Induced sputum was collected and total IgE and Phadiatop (IgE to common inhalant allergens) measurements were performed. General clinical characteristics and pulmonary inflammation indicators were analyzed between the three groups of asthmatic patients. Univariate and multifactor ordinal logistic regression were used to model the relationship between pulmonary inflammation indicators and asthma control status. The ability of sputum total IgE in identifying different levels of asthma control was assessed by receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Patients with UCA had worse lung function and airway inflammation as indicated by lower levels of forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV1)%pred, FEV1/FVC, MEF75%pred, MEF50%pred and MEF25%pred, and higher levels of FeNO and sputum eosinophil% compared with the WCA group. In addition, higher levels of total sputum IgE and Phadiatop were found in patients with UCA than in patients with WCA and PCA. Univariate and multifactor ordinal logistic regression analysis indicated that sputum total IgE was the unique significant risk factor for poor asthma control (adjusted odds ratio = 6.25; 95% CI, 1.07-36.55; p < 0.05) among pulmonary inflammation indicators including different indices of pulmonary function test, sputum IgE and FeNO. Sputum total IgE levels showed a significant correlation with asthma control scores (r = 0.53, p < 0.001). Moreover, ROC analysis showed that the predictive value of sputum total IgE for patients with UCA was 0.82 (95% CI, 0.74-0.9).

Univariate logistic analysis, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and stepwise logistic regression were utilized for feature screening. Finally, nine machine-learning models were constructed and compared, and grid search was performed to adjust the parameters. Model performance was evaluated using calibration curve and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Nine risk factors were eventually identified: age, treatment modality, cancer types, history of allergies, age-corrected Charlson comorbidity index, percentage of eosinophils, absolute number of monocytes, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status, and C-reactive protein. Among the models, the logistic model performed best, demonstrating strong performance in test set (AUROC = 0.734) and external validation set (AUROC = 0.817).

The purpose of this study was to compare the accuracy of determining gait independence using APMT and SMI in community-dwelling older adults undergoing outpatient rehabilitation. This study included 98 older adults (mean age: 85.2 years). Participants received outpatient rehabilitation one to three times a week. The main outcomes were gait independence (functional independence measure gait score: 6 or 7), skeletal muscle mass index (SMI), and APMT. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of APMT and SMI for gait independence were created, and cut-off values were calculated using the Youden index. Additionally, the area under the curve (AUC) s of the APMT model and the SMI model were compared using the Delong test. Among the 98 participants (male; 19, female; 79), 53 (54.1%) were in the gait independent group. The cut-off value of APMT calculated from the ROC curve was 13 mm; the sensitivity and specificity were 67.9% and 86.7%, respectively; and the AUC was 0.800. The cut-off value of SMI calculated from the ROC curve was 4.6 kg/m2; the sensitivity and specificity were 90.6% and 26.7%, respectively; and the AUC was 0.582. The AUC for the APMT model was significantly higher than the SMI model (P < 0.001). The results of this study show that the cut-off value of APMT for determining the gait independence was 13 mm. In addition, APMT had a higher accuracy of determining gait independence than SMI. This indicates that measuring APMT is more useful for predicting gait independence than SMI in community-dwelling older adults undergoing outpatient rehabilitation.","2025","European geriatric medicine"

This study aims to develop predictive models to identify level II lymph node metastasis (LNM), guiding selective neck dissection (SND) to minimize unnecessary surgery and morbidity in low-risk patients. A retrospective cohort of 313 PTC patients who underwent modified radical neck dissection (MRND) between October 2020 and January 2023 was analyzed. The patients were randomly assigned to a training cohort (70%) and a validation cohort (30%). Five predictive models were developed using neural networks (NNET) and logistic regression (LR) based on ultrasound radiomic features, clinical-pathological data, or a combination of both. Each model's performance was evaluated based on accuracy, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity in predicting occult level II LNM. SHapley Additive exPlanations and nomogram were used to interpret the most important features in the models. The occurrence rate of level II LNM was 28% in the cohort. Among the five predictive models developed, the LR-radiomics signature model demonstrated the highest performance, achieving an accuracy of 96.8% and an AUC of 0.989 in the validation set. In comparison, the NNET-radiomic + clinical feature model achieved an AUC of 0.935, while other models exhibited moderate to low accuracy and AUCs ranging from 0.699 to 0.785. The decision curve analysis demonstrated that the LR-radiomics signature model provided the greatest clinical utility, offering the highest net benefit across a range of decision thresholds for identifying occult level II LNM.

A Study of Thresholds Optimized for Patient Satisfaction Using the Simple Shoulder Test.","Clinically important improvement after total shoulder arthroplasty is often assessed with shoulder-specific patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) quantifying reduction in pain and restoration in function. It is unclear if commonly utilized threshold such as minimal clinically important difference (MCID), substantial clinical benefit (SCB), or patient acceptable symptom state (PASS), represent optimal improvement from the patients' perspective. The objectives of this study were to utilize the Simple Shoulder Test to: 1) compare commonly utilized thresholds for change in score and final score to thresholds optimized to patient satisfaction using receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, and 2) determine the impact of using different thresholds on reporting of independent predictors of successful outcome in terms of patient satisfaction. This study included 406 anatomic total shoulder arthroplasty (aTSA) patients from a longitudinally maintained database with two-year follow-up. Surveys included the Simple Shoulder Test (SST) and a satisfaction questionnaire. SST thresholds were calculated by commonly described techniques for MCID, SCB, %MPI (percentage of maximal possible improvement), and PASS. ROC curves were constructed to determine the optimal threshold of SST change in score (Change-ROC), final SST score (Final-ROC), and %MPI (%MPI-ROC) based on patient satisfaction. Youden's index (J) was calculated to determine each threshold's performance in maximizing sensitivity and specificity. Multivariable analysis was performed to determine predictors of surpassing selected threshold values. The thresholds with the highest Youden's index correlating best with patient satisfaction were %MPI-ROC (aTSA 61%, J=0.49; RnR 63% J=0.64) and Final-ROC (aTSA 9.5, J=0.48; RnR 9.5 J=0.60). Commonly utilized thresholds including MCID of 2.0 (J=0.21) and SCB of 2.7 (2.7) had the lowest Youden's index of the thresholds studied. Characteristics predictive of success varied substantially based on selected threshold. Current thresholds commonly utilized to gauge success after aTSA have limited ability to predict success based on patient satisfaction using the Simple Shoulder Test. Given that focus in healthcare value is shifting towards patient satisfaction, optimal thresholds utilized to measure success after shoulder arthroplasty may require reconsideration.","2025","Journal of shoulder and elbow surgery"

The umbilical vein blood flow is a surrogate parameter of the amount of oxygen and nutrients delivered to the fetus, providing valuable insights about the function of the placenta. Nevertheless, currently, this parameter is not used in the diagnosis and management of fetal growth restriction. To evaluate the umbilical vein blood flow and fetal growth velocity in small for gestational age fetuses and in fetal growth restriction, and to evaluate their capacity to predict adverse perinatal outcome and iatrogenic preterm birth. Secondly, to assess the correlation between umbilical vein blood flow and fetal growth velocity. This was a prospective multicentric observational cohort study of women with a diagnosis of small for gestational age or fetal growth restriction in which fetal biometry and Doppler assessment, including umbilical vein blood flow measurement, were performed. The fetal growth velocity was derived from the difference between the estimated fetal weight calculated in 2 consecutive sonographic evaluations. The pregnancies were followed until delivery. Between-group differences were evaluated, and Pearson or Spearman correlation coefficients were reported to assess the relationship between variables of interest. Optimal cutoffs on the resulting receiver operating characteristic curve were determined and used to predict the outcomes of interest. Simple and multiple logistic regression models were estimated using umbilical vein blood flow and fetal growth velocity to predict adverse perinatal outcomes and iatrogenic preterm birth. The study population included 64 small for gestational age and 58 growth restricted fetuses. When compared to reference ranges, small for gestational age fetuses had significantly lower fetal growth velocity and umbilical vein blood flow (P<.001). When compared to small for gestational age, fetuses with growth restriction had lower umbilical vein blood flow (P<.001), umbilical vein blood flow corrected for estimated fetal weight and abdominal circumference (P<.01 and P<.001), and fetal growth velocity (P<.001). Fetal growth velocity was positively correlated with umbilical vein blood flow (r=0.46, P<.001). The multivariable logistic regression analyses showed that, after adjusting for diagnosis of fetal growth restriction, umbilical vein blood flow ≤0.65 multiple of the median (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.5; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.0-11.8) and fetal growth velocity ≤0.63 multiple of the median (adjusted odds ratio 3.0, 95% CI 1.2-7.9) were associated with adverse perinatal outcome. Furthermore, when accounting for fetal growth restriction diagnosis, umbilical vein blood flow ≤0.60 multiple of the median (adjusted odds ratio 5.2, 95% CI 1.7-15.9), and fetal growth velocity ≤0.63 multiple of the median (adjusted odds ratio 3.6, 95% CI 1.1-12.6) were significant predictors of iatrogenic preterm birth. Umbilical vein blood flow could play a role to identify fetuses with fetal growth restriction and to predict fetal growth at the subsequent biometric evaluation. We found a significant correlation between umbilical vein blood flow and fetal growth. Umbilical vein blood flow and fetal growth velocity are independent predictors of iatrogenic preterm birth and adverse perinatal outcome in a population of small fetuses, regardless of the Delphi consensus criteria. These results support future study on the predictive value of this parameter in fetuses with a suspected fetal growth restriction.","2025","American journal of obstetrics and gynecology"

Since SCD is based on subjective experiences, no specific medical test can definitively confirm its presence, making early detection challenging. Thus, it is advantageous to develop an AI model to capitalize on self-reported health complications, personality traits, and sociodemographic factors for early detection of SCD. This research has proposed an AI-based framework for SCD detection using self-reported measures from the BRFSS 2021 dataset. A novel Weighted Fusion Selection (WFS) approach has been introduced, which combines multiple feature selection techniques to address class imbalance and identify relevant features associated with less frequent classes. The data set has shown a significant imbalance, with individuals at risk of SCD being 81.76% fewer than those not at risk. An Attention Cost Convolutional Neural Network (AC-CNN) has been developed to address this, integrating channel-wise attention mechanisms and cost-sensitive learning to enhance performance across imbalanced data. The AC-CNN model has achieved a balance between specificity (77%) and sensitivity (81%), with an AUC-ROC of 0.87. This has represented an overall 24.8% improvement in handling class imbalance compared to prior studies. Additional testing on the NHIS 2022 dataset has shown that AC-CNN has maintained balanced performance, confirming its robust generalizability, while other models have remained unstable. Further, applying SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) explainable techniques to the AC-CNN model has revealed how individual aspects of an individual's health records, lifestyle, and demographics contribute to the prediction of SCD. For example, depression, low education, poor income, inadequate healthcare, and poor overall health have all been strongly linked to an increased risk of SCD.","2025","Journal of biomedical informatics"

Taking measures against NETs is important for the treatment of acute rejection in kidney transplantation. We used the kidney ransplantation acute rejection dataset GSE50058 as a basis for identifying biomarkers associated with the regulation of NETs therein and constructing a diagnostic model using WGCNA and four machine learning algorithms. We also explored the infiltration levels of 64 immune cells and the correlation between NETs-related biomarkers and immune cells in acute rejection of kidney transplants using the xCell algorithm. Meanwhile, we established a rat kidney ransplantation acute rejection model and validated the expression of biomarkers in animal experiments. Finally, we also explored the role of one of the biomarkers in the regulation of NETs by injecting adeno-associated viruses into the tail vein of rats. In this study, we identified a total of four NETs-associated biomarkers in acute rejection of kidney transplantation: GPX3, B2M, CDK1 and MAP3K5. Among them, the expression of GPX3 was negatively correlated with acute rejection of kidney transplantation, while the remaining three markers were positively correlated with acute rejection. We constructed a diagnostic model based on the above four biomarkers, and both the ROC curve and the calibration curve proved the good diagnostic value of the model, and the DCA curve confirmed the clinical decision-making ability of the four biomarkers. The xCell algorithm identified 20 types of immune cells with significantly altered infiltration levels in acute rejection of kidney transplants, and the expression of four biomarkers was strongly associated with multiple immune cells. In animal experiments, the expression levels of the four biomarkers were consistent with the results analyzed in the dataset GSE50058. Finally, we also found through animal experiments that overexpression of GPX3 could inhibit the activation of NETs in renal tissues and reduce the secretion of inflammatory factors, thereby alleviating renal tissue injury caused by acute rejection of kidney transplantation. GPX3, B2M, CDK1 and MAP3K5 as biomarkers associated with NETs in acute rejection of kidney transplantation. Among them, GPX3 can inhibit the activation of NETs and reduce the expression of inflammatory factors in the acute rejection of kidney transplantation, thus alleviating renal tissue injury.","2025","International immunopharmacology"

The study participants were 119 patients who underwent transperitoneal RAPN. With regard to stranding, ROIs were evaluated, and the mean CT numbers were assigned a score ranging from 0 to 3. Clinical variables were evaluated in a multivariate logistic regression analysis in relation to prolonged operation time. The percentage of patients with score ≥ 3 by MAP score alone was significantly higher than those of patients with score ≥ 3 by ROI-modified MAP score alone (26.8% vs. 13.4%, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed no independent association with the MAP score. On the other hand, for ROI-modified MAP score, score ≥ 3 was an independent factor for prolonged operation time (OR = 4.28, p = 0.0032) along with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 22 (OR = 4.46, p = 0.01), R.E.N.A.L. nephrometry score ≥ 7 (OR = 4.12, p = 0.0047), posterior tumor location (OR = 2.85, p = 0.036), and clinical T stage ≥ 1b (OR = 6.19, p = 0.0044). Regarding the predictive performance, the accuracy of the ROI-modified MAP score was significantly higher than the MAP score (area under the curve [AUC] value: 0.652 vs. 0.721, p = 0.034). The ROI-modified MAP score was a more relevant factor regarding operation time, suggesting that it might be a better preoperative predictor.","2025","World journal of urology"

Notably, SSC in critically ill patients (SSC-CIP) is the most frequent cause. Variables associated with worse prognosis remain unclear. The primary aim of this study was to identify factors associated with transplant-free survival in SSC-CIP patients using readily available data. A cohort of 47 patients diagnosed with SSC-CIP was retrospectively analysed for clinical, biochemical and endoscopic variables. Kaplan-Meier survival curves, log-rank tests and univariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess associations with transplant-free survival. A multivariable Cox regression model was constructed using Lasso regularisation and validated with Bootstrap resampling. Model performance was assessed using the C-statistic for discrimination. Kaplan-Meier analysis identified bile duct obstruction requiring stent placement, and cholangitis episodes, as significant prognostic factors. In univariable analysis, age over 47 years (HR 2.61 (95% CI 1.02, 7.06), p=0.04), at least one cholangitis episode (HR 2.46 (95% CI 1.005, 6.06), p=0.04), stent placement (HR 2.89 (95% CI 1.13, 7.38), p=0.03), lower albumin levels (HR 0.52 (95% CI 0.28, 0.97), p=0.04) and higher international normalised ratio (INR) (HR 3.22 (95% CI 1.09, 9.53), p=0.03) were significant. Multivariable analysis showed that age at diagnosis, albumin and INR were significant independent predictors. The C-index was 0.78 (95% CI 0.65, 0.91), surpassing the model of end-stage liver disease score's prognostic accuracy (Concordance Index at 3 years: 66.2% vs 74.9%). These findings provide valuable insights for establishing standard exception criteria for this rare liver disease, which could lead to improved organ allocation.

This system showed promising results in single-center studies. We aim to evaluate the prognostic performance of RECIP 1.0 in assessing treatment outcomes in metastatic prostate cancer patients with a systematic review and meta-analysis. Searches were conducted across PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, and Web of Science databases through March 2024. Only studies involving patients with metastatic prostate cancer who underwent PSMA PET/CT to assess therapeutic response and who were evaluated using the RECIP 1.0 criteria were included. Pooled hazard ratios for mortality and concordance indices (c-index) of RECIP were assessed. A secondary analysis compared RECIP 1.0 to PSMA PET Progression Criteria (PPP) in head-to-head studies. From an initial 553 reports, eight met the eligibility criteria after full-text review (n=516 patients) and six underwent quantitative analysis. RECIP 1.0 significantly differentiated between disease progression and non-progression in terms of mortality risk (HR: 3.48; 95% CI: 2.64-4.59). A sub-analysis of three studies with 174 patients demonstrated a pooled c-index of 0.68 (95% CI: 0.65-0.71).

The efficacy of such advice depends on reliable glucose responses. To explore within-subject variability of CGM responses to duplicate presented meals in an inpatient setting. CGM data were collected from two inpatient feeding studies in 30 participants without diabetes, capturing 1189 responses to duplicate meals presented ∼1 wk apart from four dietary patterns. One study used two different CGMs (Abbott Freestyle Libre Pro and Dexcom G4 Platinum) whereas the other study used only Dexcom. We calculated the incremental area under the curve (iAUC) for glucose for each 2-h postmeal period and compared within-subject, within-CGM responses to duplicate presented meals using linear correlations, intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman analyses. Individual variability of interstitial glucose responses to duplicate meals were also compared with different meals using standard deviations (SDs). There were weak-to-moderate positive linear correlations between within-subject iAUCs for duplicate meals [Abbott r = 0.46, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.38, 0.54, P < 0.0001 and Dexcom r = 0.45, 95% CI: 0.39, 0.50, P < 0.0001], with low within-participant reliability indicated by ICC (Abbott 0.28, Dexcom 0.17). Bland-Altman analyses indicated wide limits of agreement (LoA) (Abbott -29.8 to 28.4 mg/dL and Dexcom -29.4 to 32.1 mg/dL) but small bias of mean iAUCs for duplicate meals (Abbott -0.7 mg/dL and Dexcom 1.3 mg/dL). The individual variability of interstitial glucose responses to duplicate meals was similar to that of different meals evaluated each diet week for both Abbott [SDweek1 11.7 mg/dL (compared with duplicate P = 0.01), SDweek2 10.6 mg/dL (P = 0.43), and SDduplicate 10.1 mg/dL] and Dexcom [SDweek1 10.9 mg/dL (P = 0.62), SDweek2 11.0 mg/dL (P = 0.73), and SDduplicate 11.2 mg/dL]. Individual postprandial CGM responses to duplicate meals were highly variable in adults without diabetes.

However, an optimal metric for RIL remains undefined but is important for the application of this knowledge in clinical decision-making and trial designs. The aim of this study was to find the optimal RIL metric discerning survival. Patients with esophageal cancer treated with concurrent chemoradiation therapy (CRT; 2004-2022) were selected. Studied metrics included absolute lymphocyte counts (ALCs) and neutrophil counts-and calculated derivatives-at baseline and during CRT. Multivariable Cox regression models for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) were developed for each RIL metric. The optimal RIL metric was defined as the one in the model with the highest c-statistic. Among 1339 included patients, 68% received photon-based and 32% proton-based CRT (median follow-up, 24.9 months). In multivariable analysis, the best-performing models included ""ALC in week 3 of CRT"" (corrected c-statistic 0.683 for PFS and 0.662 for OS). At an optimal threshold of <0.5 × 103/μL (ie, grade ≥3 RIL), ALC in week 3 was significantly associated with PFS (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.64; 95% CI, 1.27-2.13) and OS (adjusted hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% CI, 1.15-2.08), with 5-year PFS of 29% vs 40% and OS of 38% vs 51%, respectively. Reaching grade ≥3 RIL in week 3 of CRT for esophageal cancer is the strongest RIL metric to distinguish survival outcomes. We suggest that this metric should be the target for lymphopenia-mitigating strategies and propose this metric to be included in future trials.","2025","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"

We retrospectively analyzed 538 AAV patients diagnosed between January 2013 and July 2019, with follow-up data extending to August 2020. The Least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) regression analysis was employed to identify variables predictive of mortality. Subsequently, a nomogram was developed, with its predictive accuracy and discrimination assessed by the concordance index and calibration curves, respectively. A total of 460 (85.5 %) AAV patients presented with pulmonary involvement. The mortality was 36.8 %. Patients with pulmonary involvement more frequently exhibited respiratory symptoms, predominantly interstitial lung disease on radiographs, and were at higher risk for respiratory failure, diffuse alveolar hemorrhage, mechanic ventilation and death (All P < 0.05). The LASSO regression pinpointed 16 predictors of mortality, and the predictive model demonstrated an area under the curve of 0.810. The nomogram, based on these variables, achieved a concordance index of 0.825, with calibration curve indicating excellent predictive agreement. The study establishes a predictive model for AAV mortality with high accuracy, offering insights crucial for patient care. Pulmonary involvement, prevalent and linked to higher mortality, underscores the need for precise predictive tools in AAV management.","2025","International immunopharmacology"

This study aimed to evaluate the time-dose-effect relationship of miR-200c-3p in plasma, urine and cartilage of rats with drinking water fluorosis, and to explore its potential as a biomarker. Analyses were conducted using Generalised linear models, Restricted cubic spline, Spearman correlation analysis, and Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). Results indicated that both fluoride exposure time and dose had significantly affected on urinary and cartilage miR-200c-3p expression in rats, while plasma miR-200c-3p expression was only influenced by fluoride exposure time. Restricted cubic spline plots revealed that urinary miR-200c-3p was non-linearly and positively correlated with serum fluoride, urinary fluoride, dental fluorosis, and Mankin score groups, and also linearly and positively correlated with cartilage fluoride. Regression analysis showed that for each unit increase in urinary miR-200c-3p, the likelihood of dental fluorosis increased by 1.300 times, and in the Mankin score groups, the likelihood increased by 1.251 times. The ROC curves demonstrated that urinary miR-200c-3p had high sensitivity and specificity in diagnosing dental and skeletal fluorosis. Blood and cartilage miR-200c-3p showed weaker diagnostic efficacy. In summary, fluoride has different effects on the expression levels of miRNA-200c in various biological samples of rats, and miRNAs in urine demonstrate potential as biomarkers for fluorosis.","2025","Ecotoxicology and environmental safety"

A total of 161 patients who underwent major abdominal surgery were readmitted to the surgical intensive care unit during hospitalization. To clarify the predictors of mortality in patients after surgical intensive care unit readmission, clinical data, including the 3 types of early warning scores at the time of deterioration before readmission, were analyzed. The incidence of readmission to the surgical intensive care unit was 6.0%, and the mean duration between the first discharge from the surgical intensive care unit and readmission was 11.2 days. Of the 161 patients, 58 (36.0%) died in hospital. In the multivariate analyses, a higher Modified Early Warning Score at readmission was independently associated with 30-day and in-hospital mortality. The receiver operating characteristic curve of Modified Early Warning Score at readmission demonstrated fair predictive power for 30-day (area under the curve = 0.709) and in-hospital (area under the curve = 0.697) mortality in patients readmitted to the surgical intensive care unit after major abdominal surgery.

The performance of defacing with the face mask created by TotalSegmentator was compared to a state-of-the-art CT defacing algorithm. Face detection was performed using deep learning models. The cosine similarity between facial embeddings for intra- and inter-patient images was compared. A Support Vector Machine was trained on cosine similarity values to assess defacing performance, determining if two renderings came from the same patient. This analysis was conducted on defaced and non-defaced images using 5-fold cross-validation. Faces were detected in 76.5 % of non-defaced images. Intra-patient images exhibited a median cosine similarity of 0.65 (IQR: 0.47-0.80), compared to 0.50 (IQR: 0.39-0.62) for inter-patient images. A binary classifier performed moderately on non-defaced images, achieving a ROC-AUC of 0.69 (SD = 0.01) and an accuracy of 0.65 (SD = 0.01) in distinguishing whether a scan belonged to the same or a different individual. Following defacing, performance declined markedly. Defacing with the TotalSegmentator decreased the ROC-AUC to 0.55 (SD = 0.02) and the accuracy to 0.56 (SD = 0.01), whereas the CTA-DEFACE algorithm brought the performance down to a ROC-AUC of 0.60 (SD = 0.02) and an accuracy of 0.59 (SD = 0.01). These results demonstrate the effectiveness of defacing algorithms in mitigating re-identification risks, with the TotalSegmentator providing slightly superior privacy protection. Facial recognition software can identify facial features from partial and complete head CT scan renderings. However, using the TotalSegmentator to deface images reduces re-identification risks to a near-chance level. We offer code to implement this privacy-preserving pipeline. Utilizing the TotalSegmentator framework, the proposed pipeline efficiently removes facial features from CT images, making it ideal for multi-site research and data sharing. It is a useful tool for radiographers and radiologists who must comply with medico-legal requirements necessitating the removal of facial features.","2025","Radiography (London, England : 1995)"

Traditionally, PA intensity is classified using METs, with 1 MET equal to 3.5 mL O2·min-1·kg-1. However, this may underestimate moderate and vigorous intensity due to age-related changes in resting metabolic rate (RMR) and VO2max. VO2reserve accounts for these changes. While receiver operating characteristics (ROC) analysis is commonly used to develop PA, intensity cut-points, machine learning (ML) offers a potential alternative. This study aimed to develop ROC cut-points and ML models to classify PA intensity in older adults. Sixty-seven older adults performed activities of daily living (ADL) and two six-minute walking tests (6-MWT) while wearing six accelerometers on their hips, wrists, thigh, and lower back. Oxygen uptake was measured. ROC and ML models were developed for ENMO and Actigraph counts (AGVMC) using VO2reserve as the criterion in two-third of the sample and validated in the remaining third. ROC-developed cut-points showed good-excellent AUC (0.84-0.93) for the hips, lower back, and thigh, but wrist cut-points failed to distinguish between moderate and vigorous intensity. The accuracy of ML models was high and consistent across all six anatomical sites (0.83-0.89).

Previous studies often faced limitations, such as small sample sizes, focusing on only one neuroimaging modality, and reliance on univariate analyses, which produced inconsistent findings. This study was designed to overcome these issues by using for the first time advanced multivariate machine-learning techniques to identify the neural mechanisms underlying SAP. Specifically, we relied on the multimodal Canonical Correlation Analysis approach combined with Independent Component Analysis (ICA) to decompose the structural magnetic resonance images from 122 participants into covarying gray and white matter networks. Stepwise logistic regression and boosted decision trees were then used to extract a predictive model of SAP. Our results indicate that four covarying gray and white matter networks, IC19, IC14, IC21, and IC13, were critical in classifying SAP individuals from control subjects. These networks included brain regions, such as the Middle Temporal Gyrus, Precuneus, Insula, and Anterior Cingulate Cortex-all known for their roles in emotional regulation, cognitive control, and sensory processing. To test the generalizability of our results, we additionally ran a supervised machine-learning model (boosted decision trees), which achieved an 83.3% classification accuracy, with AUC of 0.9, indicating good predictive power. These findings provide new insights into the neurobiological underpinnings of SAP and suggest potential biomarkers for diagnosing and treating this condition.

Additionally, ROC curves indicated a significant relationship between Post-CL and LOCL (p = 0.008, AUC = 0.718), with a Post-CL threshold value of 9.5°, and a relationship between Pre-T1s and LOCL (p = 0.025, AUC = 0.687). Tumor location, clinical staging, age, sex, and length of the segments involved in the tumor were not significantly associated with LOCL. Patients with a post-CL of less than 9.5° or Pre-T1s of more than 24.5° had a noticeably higher risk of developing LOCL. Active intervention in conjunction with surgical follow-up may be required for patients experiencing significant discomfort and associated functional impairment.","2025","Neurosurgical review"

It primarily includes T2-Weighted imaging (T2w), diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and Dynamic Contrast-Enhanced imaging (DCE). Despite its improvements in CsPca screening, concerns about the cost-effectiveness of DCE persist due to its associated side effects, increased cost, longer acquisition time, and limitations in patients with poor kidney function. Recent studies have explored Biparametric MRI (Bp-MRI) as an alternative that excludes DCE. The main objective of this study is to compile and evaluate updated results of Bp-MRI as a diagnostic alternative to detect CsPca. A systematic review was conducted using PubMed, Central Cochrane, and ClinicalTrialls.gov registry. Inclusion criteria was focused on observational and experimental studies that assessed a direct comparison of Bp-MRI and Mp-MRI for CsPca detection. The primary outcomes included were necessary to create a contingency 2×2 table and CsPca prevalence from each study. The secondary outcomes included were demographic data and imaging protocol features. The statistical analysis used a Bivariate Random-Effect model to estimate the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC). An univariate random-effect model was conducted to estimate the positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, and diagnostic odds ratio. Risk of bias was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies -2 tool. From 534 articles initially identified, 19 studies met the inclusion criteria with a total of 5075 patients. The pooled sensitivity estimated was 0.89, pooled specificity was 0.73, and AUC was 0.90; these results showed a slight increase compared to previous studies. The results obtained showed that Bp-MRI is a feasible alternative to detect CsPca, which demonstrates high diagnostic accuracy and avoids the drawbacks associated with DCE. This is a sub-analysis of the protocol registered at PROSPERO (CRD42024552125).","2025","Urologic oncology"

Traditional imaging methods such as CT and endoscopy have limitations in staging accuracy. This retrospective study included 691 gastric cancer patients treated from March 2017 to March 2024. Enhanced venous-phase CT and endoscopic images, along with postoperative pathological results, were collected. We developed three modeling approaches: (1) nine deep learning models applied to CT images (DeepCT), (2) 11 machine learning algorithms using handcrafted radiomic features from CT images (HandcraftedCT), and (3) ResNet-50-extracted deep features from endoscopic images followed by 11 machine learning algorithms (DeepEndo). The two top-performing models from each approach were combined into the Integrated Multi-Modal Model using a stacking ensemble method. Performance was assessed using ROC-AUC, sensitivity, and specificity. The Integrated Multi-Modal Model achieved an ROC-AUC of 0.933 (95% CI, 0.887-0.979) on the test set, outperforming individual models. Sensitivity and specificity were 0.869 and 0.840, respectively. Various evaluation metrics demonstrated that the final fusion model effectively integrated the strengths of each sub-model, resulting in a balanced and robust performance with reduced false-positive and false-negative rates. The Integrated Multi-Modal Model effectively integrates radiomic and deep learning features from CT and endoscopic images, demonstrating superior performance in preoperative pathological staging of gastric cancer. This multimodal approach enhances predictive accuracy and provides a reliable tool for clinicians to develop individualized treatment plans, thereby improving patient outcomes.

Data of 115 patients with STTs of extremities and trunk were collected from our hospital as the training set, and data of other 70 patients were collected from another center as the external validation set. Outlined Regions of interest included the intratumor and the peritumor region extending outward by 5 mm, then the corresponding radiomics features were extracted respectively. Deep learning was performed using pretrained 3D ResNet algorithms, and deep learning features were extracted from the entire FS-T2WI of patients. Recursive feature elimination and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator were used to select the radiomics and deep learning features with predictive value. Five machine learning algorithms were applied to build radiomics models, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) in the validation set were used to evaluate the diagnostic performance, and decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the clinical benefit of models. Based on 20 selected deep learning and radiomics features, the deep learning radiomics (DLR) model had the best predictive performance in the validation set, with an AUC of 0.9410. DCA and calibration curves showed that the DLR model had better clinical net benefit and goodness of fit. By extracting more features from FS-T2WI, the DLR model is a noninvasive, low-cost, and highly accurate preoperative differential diagnosis of benign and malignant STTs.","2025","Academic radiology"

In this retrospective study, patients with biopsy or surgerical resection and histopathologically confirmed small (≤20 mm) SPLs were included. One wk before biopsy/surgery, pre-operative B-mode ultrasound and contrast-enhanced ultrasound were performed. An ultrasonic system (ACUSON Sequoia, Siemens Medical Solutions, PA, USA) equipped with a 5C1 MHz convex array transducer was utilized. A dose of 1.5 ml SonoVue (Bracco, Italy) was injected as the contrast agent. Time-intensity curves were generated using VueBox software (Bracco) and various DCE-US quantitative parameters were subsequently calculated after curve fitting. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis were utilized. From August 2020 to November 2023, a total of 76 patients (31 males and 45 females; mean age: 61.9 ± 10.5 y) with 76 small (≤20 mm) SPLs were included. Mean size of the lesions was 16.4 ± 0.4 mm (range: 7-20 mm). Final diagnosis included 37 benign and 39 malignant small SPLs. On B-mode ultrasound, the majority of malignant (37/39, 94.9%) and benign SPLs (30/37, 81.1%) were hypo-echoic lesions with ill-defined borders and irregular shapes (p > 0.05). During the arterial phase of contrast-enhanced ultrasound, most SPLs (59/76, 77.6%) exhibited iso-enhancement when compared with surrounding pancreatic parenchyma. Subsequently, 82.1% (32/39) of malignant SPLs and 35.1% (13/37) of benign SPLs demonstrated wash-out in the venous phase and showed hypo-enhancement in venous and late phases (p > 0.05). Compared with benign SPLs, the time-intensity curves of small malignant SPLs revealed earlier and lower enhancement in the arterial phase, and a faster decline during the venous phase with a decreased area under the curve. Among the quantitative parameters, a lower peak enhancement ratio and higher fall time ratio were more common in small malignant SPLs (p < 0.05). For DCE-US analysis, the combined areas under the curve of significant quantitative parameters was 0.919, with 87.2% sensitivity and 86.5% specificity when differentiating between small malignant and benign SPLs. This result was better than contrast-enhanced computed tomography, which has a sensitivity of 74.4% and a specificity of 75.7%. DCE-US analysis provides added value for the pre-operative differential diagnosis of small malignant SPLs.","2025","Ultrasound in medicine & biology"

In 35,815 patients from the VISION cohort study and 9219 patients from the POISE-2 trial who were ≥45 yr old and underwent nonurgent inpatient noncardiac surgery, we examined (by age and sex) the association between continuous nonlinear preoperative estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and the composite of myocardial injury after noncardiac surgery, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or death owing to a cardiac cause within 30 days after surgery. We estimated contributions of predictive information, C-statistic, and net benefit from eGFR and other common patient and surgical characteristics to large multivariable models. The primary composite occurred in 4725 (13.2%) patients in VISION and 1903 (20.6%) in POISE-2; in both studies cardiac events had a strong, graded association with lower preoperative eGFR that was attenuated by older age (Pinteraction<0.001 for VISION; Pinteraction=0.008 for POISE-2). For eGFR of 30 compared with 90 ml min-1 1.73 m-2, relative risk was 1.49 (95% confidence interval 1.26-1.78) at age 80 yr but 4.50 (2.84-7.13) at age 50 yr in female patients in VISION. This differed modestly (but not meaningfully) in men in VISION (Pinteraction=0.02) but not in POISE-2 (Pinteraction=0.79). eGFR contributed the most predictive information and mean net benefit of all predictors in both studies, most C-statistic in VISION, and third most C-statistic in POISE-2. Continuous preoperative eGFR is among the best cardiac risk predictors in noncardiac surgery of the large set examined. Along with its interaction with age, preoperative eGFR would improve risk calculators. ClinicalTrials.gov NCT00512109 (VISION) and NCT01082874 (POISE-2).","2025","British journal of anaesthesia"

Exosome non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), a type of liquid biopsy, have emerged as promising diagnostic biomarkers for various tumours. This study aimed to identify a serum exosome ncRNA feature for enhancing GC diagnosis. Serum exosomes from patients with GC (n=37) and healthy donors (n=20) were characterised using RNA sequencing, and potential biomarkers for GC were validated through quantitative reverse transcription PCR (qRT-PCR) in both serum exosomes and tissues. A combined diagnostic model was developed using LASSO-logistic regression based on a cohort of 518 GC patients and 460 healthy donors, and its diagnostic performance was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic curves. RNA sequencing identified 182 candidate biomarkers for GC, of which 31 were validated as potential biomarkers by qRT-PCR. The combined diagnostic score (cd-score), derived from the expression levels of four long ncRNAs (RP11.443C10.1, CTD-2339L15.3, LINC00567 and DiGeorge syndrome critical region gene (DGCR9)), was found to surpass commonly used biomarkers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen, carbohydrate antigen 19-9 (CA19-9) and CA72-4, in distinguishing GC patients from healthy donors across training, testing and external validation cohorts, with AUC values of 0.959, 0.942 and 0.949, respectively. Additionally, the cd-score could effectively identify GC patients with negative gastrointestinal tumour biomarkers and those in early-stage. Furthermore, molecular biological assays revealed that knockdown of DGCR9 inhibited GC tumour growth. Our proposed serum exosome ncRNA feature provides a promising liquid biopsy approach for enhancing the early diagnosis of GC.","2025","Gut"

This study aimed to identify potential biomarkers for early detection of CRC utilizing targeted metabolite profiling of platelet-rich plasma (PRP). Based on multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode, liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis identified metabolites in PRP collected from patients with CRC (n = 70) and healthy controls (n = 30). A total of 302 metabolites were identified and quantified in this study, including various categories such as lipids, lipid mediators, amino acids, and derivatives, organic acids and derivatives, nucleotides and derivatives, alkaloids, carbohydrates, vitamins and derivatives, and others. The differential analysis revealed that five carbohydrates and organic acids (lactose, glycerol-3-phosphate, 2-hydroxyglutaric acid, isocitric acid, and citric acid) involved in the carbohydrate metabolism pathway displayed consistent upregulation within PRP derived from patients with CRC. To further validate the abundance of differential metabolites, 10 pairs of CRC tissues, adjacent tissues, and matched PRP were collected. Ultimately, five carbohydrate metabolites were validated in PRP, and compared with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and cancer antigen 19-9 (CA199), the five carbohydrate metabolites significantly improved the specificity of differentiating patients with CRC from healthy controls. Furthermore, the diagnostic efficacy of the combined five-carbohydrate metabolite panel was superior to that of individual metabolites, CEA and CA199. The sensitivity, specificity, and AUC of the metabolite panel in distinguishing patients with CRC from healthy controls were 90.00%, 96.67%, and 0.961 (95% CI 0.922-0.998), respectively.

TTE and 3D STE were employed to evaluate cardiac function and structure, also left atrial strain. Patients were categorized into two groups based on functional outcome at discharge and 3 months post-stroke, respectively. Models combining variables related to unfavorable outcome were established, and their predictive efficacy was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Additionally, AIS patients were stratified into cardioembolic and non-cardioembolic stroke groups. Logistic regression identified predictors for cardioembolic stroke, and ROC curves assessed their diagnostic performance. We found that a decrease in early diastolic peak velocity of the mitral valve (E value) was independently associated with adverse outcomes at both discharge (P = 0.014, OR = 0.126, 95% CI 0.024-0.657) and 3 months post-stroke in AIS patients (P = 0.004, OR = 0.054, 95% CI 0.007-0.403). Adding E value significantly improved predictive ability for adverse outcome at discharge and 3 months post-onset (0.807 vs. 0.794; 0.834 vs. 0.815). Moreover, left atrial diameter (LAD) [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.705] was the most valuable TTE parameter, and left atrial reservoir circumferential strain (LASr-c) (AUC = 0.766) was the most valuable STE parameter, even among all echocardiographic parameters for prediction of cardioembolic stroke. This study indicates reduced E value was associated with unfavorable outcome at discharge and 3 months post-onset of AIS patients.

In June and September 2020, samples from the metro trains, ground transport and stationary objects were collected, enriched and cultured. The antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by broth microdilution. Staphylococcus aureus isolates exhibiting inconclusive results of vancomycin susceptibility testing were retested by broth macrodilution and subjected to whole genome sequencing. All S. aureus isolates were tested for vancomycin heteroresistance (hVISA). A total of 513/542 (94.6 %) samples were culture-positive with higher frequency in September (p = 0.004). S. aureus was the most frequent opportunistic bacterial pathogen found (3.7 %, 20/542) followed by Enterobacterales spp. (1.8 %, 10/542). No methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), extended-spectrum beta-lactamase producers (ESBL) or carbapenemase-producing bacteria were detected. Resistance to clinically relevant drugs was rare except for resistance to ampicillin (67 %, 8/12), cefuroxime (42 %, 5/12) in Enterobacterales and chloramphenicol (90 %, 18/20), penicillin (45 %, 9/20), and erythromycin (20 %, 4/20) in S. aureus. One S. aureus isolate was shown to be resistant to vancomycin (8 mg/L) by forming large visible cell aggregates. Population analysis profile-area under the curve ratio (PAP-AUC) testing did not confirm the hVISA phenotype, but mutations in the hVISA phenotype-related gene vraR and other genes related to cell wall synthesis (fmtB) and intercellular adhesion (sasC) were found. Our study shows that in the COVID-19 pandemic, despite the intensive use of disinfectants, public transport was a source of opportunistic bacterial pathogens including S. aureus with unusual vancomycin resistance phenotype that could be easily missed by standard susceptibility testing.","2025","Ecotoxicology and environmental safety"

Traditional radiomic models are lacking in a consideration for intratumoral regional heterogeneity. The study aimed to establish and validate the predictive power of multiple habitat radiomic models in predicting prognosis of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). A total of 232 HCC patients were retrospectively included, including a training/validation cohort and two external testing cohorts from 4 centers. For habitat radiomics, intratumoral habitat partitioning based on CT images was first performed by using Otsu thresholding method. Second, a total of 350 habitat radiomic models were constructed to select the optimal model. Then, both ROC curve analyses and Kaplan-Meier survival curve analyses were applied to assess the predictive performances. Ultimately, an immune status profiling was conducted based on bioinformatic analyses and multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) assays to reveal the potential mechanisms. A total of 4 habitats were segmented, and the corresponding habitat radiomic models were constructed based on each habitat and an integration of all the four habitats. Generally, habitat radiomic models outperformed traditional radiomic models in stratifying prognosis for HCC. The habitat radiomic model based on the segmented habitat 4 involving decision tree (DT) screening and random forest (RF) classifier was identified as the optimal model with an AUCmean of 0.806. Distinct resting natural killer (NK) cell infiltrations significantly contributed to the prognosis stratification of HCC by the optimal habitat radiomic model. The habitat radiomic model based on CT images was potentially predictive of overall survival for HCC, with a superiority over the traditional radiomic model. The prognostic power of the habitat radiomic model was partly attributed to the distinct immune status captured in the CT images.","2025","Translational oncology"

Cutoffs for PsAID12 were determined against disease activity scores, defining disease impact states (ie remission, low impact, moderate impact and high impact). Statistics used to assess the optimal cutoff point included the Youden's index and the 75th percentile method, with external anchors (i.e. DAPSA, VDLA/MDA and single questions for both patients and physicians) serving as gold standards. The diagnostic performance of these cutoffs was evaluated using Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. A total of 410 patients were analyzed. Mean (standard deviation, SD) PsAID12 score was 3.4 (SD 2.5). The prevalence of remission varied between 12.4% and 36.1%, while low disease activity ranged from 37.8% to 59.8%. PsAID12 performed well against external anchors, with high areas under the ROC curves ranging from 0.75-0.94.

Compared with composite scores, patient and physician opinions performed less stringent. This study established cutoffs for PsAID12 in a clinical practice observational population, corresponding to remission and varying levels of disease impact. However, these proposed cutoffs need further validation, and an expert consensus is essential to confirm the most accurate thresholds for future use.","2025","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)"

Among the various types of end-organ damage associated with sepsis, hepatic injury is linked to significantly higher mortality rates compared to dysfunction in other organ systems. This study aimed to investigate potential biomarkers of hepatic injury in sepsis patients through a multi-center, case-control approach. We enrolled three matched cohorts: 37 sepsis patients with hepatic dysfunction (S-HD), 37 sepsis patients without hepatic dysfunction (S-CON), and 18 healthy controls (HC). We measured five proposed biomarkers of hepatic dysfunction-ARG1, MDH1, GSTα, 5-NT, and SDH-using multiplex immunoassays. These biomarkers were compared to traditional markers of hepatic dysfunction, including albumin, bilirubin, ALT, AST, and GGT, across the cohorts using both conventional statistical methods and machine learning techniques. The median age of participants was comparable across cohorts: S-HD (65.0 years, IQR 49.5-82.5), S-CON (65.0 years, IQR 48.0-81.5), and HC (62.5 years, IQR 53.0-65.0; P = 0.794). Patients with hepatic dysfunction (S-HD) exhibited higher illness severity scores compared to those without hepatic dysfunction (S-CON): MODS scores were median 7.0 (IQR 4.0-10.0) in S-HD versus median 4.0 (IQR 2.0-7.0) in S-CON (P = 0.005), and SOFA scores were median 7.0 (IQR 4.0-11.0) in S-HD versus median 3.0 (IQR 2.0-6.0) in S-CON (P < 0.001). Hemoglobin and platelet counts were lower, while creatinine levels were higher in S-HD compared to S-CON (P < 0.05). On ICU Day 1, bilirubin, ALT, AST, GGT, and INR were significantly elevated in S-HD relative to S-CON (P ≤ 0.001), and albumin levels were lower (P < 0.05). Additionally, ARG1, GSTα, 5-NT, and SDH were significantly higher in S-HD patients on ICU Day 1 compared to S-CON (P < 0.05). ARG1, MDH1, and SDH showed positive correlations with AST, ALT, and MODS (P < 0.01). From ICU Day 1 to Day 7, ARG1, GSTα, SDH, and AST levels significantly decreased in S-HD patients (P < 0.05), whereas MDH1 and 5-NT levels did not. Among the proposed biomarkers, GSTα and 5-NT did not correlate with traditional hepatic dysfunction markers but were significant in identifying S-HD patients (feature importance 0.131 and 0.097, respectively) in a random forest classification model. This comprehensive model demonstrated excellent performance in distinguishing sepsis patients with hepatic injury, with sensitivity 0.93, specificity 0.94, NPV 0.94, PPV 0.94, and AUC 0.94.

We conducted a cross-sectional study collecting spirometry data from a healthcare center and a tertiary hospital between 2017 and 2022, with additional raw flow-volume curve data from primary healthcare institutions in 2023. We analyzed differences in concavity between spirometric patterns. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the predictive power of concavity for spirometric patterns. The relationship among concavity indices was examined. This study included 18,938 cases, with 22% exhibiting an obstructive pattern. The dataset comprised 14,868 cases for training, 3716 cases for validation, and 354 cases for testing. In the training set, the mean angle β were 180.3 ± 12.4 and 148.5 ± 12.7 degrees in normal and obstruction patterns. The angle β had an AUC of 0.970 (95% CI 0.966-0.973) for identifying normal and obstructive patterns, with a cut-off value of 163.0 degrees. In the validation set, out of 2311 cases with a normal forced vital capacity (FVC), 3.1% cases exhibited a Z-score of forced expiratory volume in 1 s to FVC ratio (FEV1/FVC) ≥  - 1.645 but an angle β < 163.0 degrees. In testing set, a correlation coefficient of - 0.96 and - 0.79 was found between the angle β and the central or peripheral concavity. The concavity of the descending limb of MEFV curves may be crucial in identifying spirometric patterns.","2025","Lung"

We evaluated the performance of a novel electronic nose for different respiratory diseases, and exhaled breath samples from patients were analyzed by GC-MS. Patients with lung cancer, pneumonia, structural lung diseases, and healthy controls were recruited (May 2019-July 2022). Exhaled breath samples were collected for eNose and GC-MS analysis. Breathprint features from eNose were analyzed using support vector machine model and leave-one-out cross-validation was performed. A total of 263 participants (including 95 lung cancer, 59 pneumonia, 71 structural lung disease, and 38 healthy participants) were included. Three-dimensional linear discriminant analysis (LDA) showed a clear distribution of breathprints. The overall accuracy of eNose for four groups was 0.738 (194/263). The accuracy was 0.86 (61/71), 0.81 (77/95), 0.53 (31/59), and 0.66 (25/38) for structural lung disease, lung cancer, pneumonia, and control groups respectively. Pair-wise diagnostic performance comparison revealed excellent discriminant power (AUC: 1-0.813) among four groups. The best performance was between structural lung disease and healthy controls (AUC: 1), followed by lung cancer and structural lung disease (AUC: 0.958). Volatile organic compounds revealed a high individual occurrence rate of cyclohexanone and N,N-dimethylacetamide in pneumonic patients, ethyl acetate in structural lung disease, and 2,3,4-trimethylhexane in lung cancer patients. Our study showed that the novel eNose effectively distinguishes respiratory diseases and holds potential as a point-of-care diagnostic tool, with GC-MS identifying candidate VOC biomarkers.","2025","Lung"

We describe an approach for creating a reference standard for acute infection using unrestricted adjudication and apply it to compare biomarker tools. Adults and children with suspected acute infection enrolled in three prospective studies at emergency departments and urgent cares were included. Adjudicators, blinded to C-reactive protein, procalcitonin, and MeMed BV (MMBV), labeled each case (bacterial/viral/non-infectious/indeterminate). Initial adjudication involved 3 adjudicators. Reference standard cohorts were defined: Microbiologically confirmed (3/3 adjudicators concur with high confidence and a concordant microbiological finding), unanimous (3/3 adjudicators concur with high confidence), suspected (3/3 adjudicators concur with high/moderate confidence or 2/3 adjudicators concur with high confidence) and all-inclusive (remaining unlabeled cases were reviewed by up to 7 additional adjudicators until reaching a leading label). Among 1016 patients, 156 difficult-to-diagnose cases required over 3 adjudicators. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve in the microbiologically confirmed (n=427), unanimous (n=565), suspected (n=860) and all-inclusive (n=1016) cohorts for MMBV were 0.98 (95% confidence interval 0.94-1.00), 0.98 (0.95-1.00), 0.95 (0.92-0.98) and 0.90 (0.87-0.93), respectively, and for procalcitonin were 0.69 (0.57-0.81), 0.77 (0.68-0.86), 0.74 (0.68-0.80) and 0.70 (0.65-0.75), respectively. A delta in performance between MMBV and procalcitonin was maintained across the different cohorts. Creating a reference standard that includes difficult-to-diagnose cases demands an approach to addressing diagnostic uncertainty in acute infections. Tool performance depends on the reference standard applied and decreases as the difficulty to diagnose increases, highlighting the importance of using the same reference standard when comparing tools.","2025","Clinical infectious diseases : an official publication of the Infectious Diseases Society of America"

We aimed to explore the relationship between plasma proteomics and PAD in individuals with T2D, and assess whether proteomics could refine PAD risk prediction. This cohort study included 1,859 individuals with T2D from the UK Biobank. Multivariable-adjusted Cox regression models were used to explore associations between 2,920 plasma proteins and incident PAD. Proteins were further selected as predictors using least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) penalty. Predictive performance was assessed using Harrell's C-index, time-dependent area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, continuous/categorical net reclassification improvement, and integrated discrimination improvement. Over a median follow-up of 13.2 years, 157 incident PAD cases occurred. We observed 463 proteins associated with PAD risk, primarily involved in pathways related to signal transduction, inflammatory response, plasma membrane, protein binding, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interactions. Ranking by P values, the top five proteins associated with increased PAD risk included EDA2R, ADM, NPPB, CD302, and NPC2, while BCAN, UMOD, PLB1, CA6, and KLK3 were the top five proteins inversely associated with PAD risk. Incorporating 45 LASSO-selected proteins or a weighted protein risk score significantly enhanced PAD prediction beyond clinical variables alone, reaching a maximum C-index of 0.835. This study identified plasma proteins associated with PAD risk in individuals with T2D. Adding proteomic data into the clinical model significantly improved PAD prediction.","2025","Diabetes care"

Capillary blood has the potential for application in vitamin A assessment. The aim of this study is to validate the accuracy of capillary blood for assessing vitamin A nutritional status among young children. Venous and capillary blood samples were simultaneously collected from 1366 healthy children under 7 years of age across 12 regions in China. Retinol was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS/MS). The agreement was assessed with Bland-Altman plot, Kappa, and prevalence-adjusted and bias-adjusted kappa (PABAK) values. The sensitivity and specificity were evaluated using the ROC curve method. Venous and capillary retinol levels showed significant differences but were highly correlated with r of 0.93. Ordinary least squares regression was used to characterize (β = 0.913) and correct the systematic bias in capillary data (compared to paired venous). Thereafter, Bland-Altman analysis demonstrated that the mean bias of corrected capillary retinol compared to venous retinol was 0.01 (95%CI: -0.24, 0.25) μmol/L with no significant difference (p ＞ 0.05). Corrected capillary retinol showed excellent performance for estimating vitamin A status when compared to venous retinol, with Kappa of 0.77-0.83, PABAK of 0.80-0.96, sensitivity of 0.86-0.91 and specificity of 0.87-0.98.

To improve the screening ability of COPD-EQ, we used a series of machine learning (ML)-based methods, including logistic regression, XgBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. These models were developed and then evaluated on a random 3:1 train/test split. Through the Delphi approach, we developed the primary version of COPD-EQ with nine items. In the following prospective multicentre study, we recruited 1824 outpatients from 12 sites, of whom 404 (22.1%) were diagnosed with COPD. After the score assignment assisted by ML models and the Shapley Additive Explanation method, six of nine items were retained for a briefer version of COPD-EQ. The scoring-based method achieves an AUC score of 0.734 at a threshold of 4.0. Finally, a novel six-item COPD-EQ questionnaire was developed.

We evaluated cognition in COVID-19 patients hospitalized during the first wave (March to June 2020) from six Dutch hospitals, nine months post-discharge, using a comprehensive multi-domain neuropsychological test battery. Test performance was corrected for sex, age, and education differences and transformed into z-scores. Scores within each cognitive domain were averaged and categorized as average and above (z-score ≥ -0.84), low average (z-score -1.28 to -0.84), below average (z-score -1.65 to -1.28), and exceptionally low (z-score < -1.65). Patients were classified with cognitive impairment if at least one domain's z-score fell below -1.65. We assessed the MoCA's accuracy using both the original cutoff (<26) and an ""optimal"" cutoff determined by Youden's index. Cognitive impairment was found in 12.1% (24/199) of patients, with verbal memory and mental speed most affected (6.5% and 7% below -1.65, respectively). The MoCA had an area under the curve of 0.84. The original cutoff showed sensitivity of 83% and specificity of 66%. Using the identified optimal cutoff of <24, maintained sensitivity while improving specificity to 81%. Cognitive impairment prevalence in initially hospitalized COVID-19 patients is lower than initially expected. Verbal memory and processing speed are primarily affected.

This retrospective study evaluates the efficacy of machine learning algorithms, with a focus on the Random Forest Classifier, to predict the presence of thyroid-specific autoantibodies (TPOAb and TgAb) in pSS patients. A total of 96 patients with pSS were included in the retrospective study. All participants underwent a complete clinical and laboratory evaluation. All participants underwent thyroid function tests, including TPOAb and TgAb, and were accordingly divided into positive and negative thyroid autoantibody groups. Four machine learning algorithms were then used to analyze the risk factors affecting patients with pSS with positive and negative for thyroid autoantibodies. The results indicated that the Random Forest Classifier algorithm (AUC = 0.755) outperformed the other three machine learning algorithms. The random forest classifier indicated Age, IgG, C4 and dry mouth were the main factors influencing the prediction of positive thyroid autoantibodies in pSS patients. It is feasible to predict AIT in pSS using machine learning algorithms. Analyzing clinical and laboratory data from 96 pSS patients, the Random Forest model demonstrated superior performance (AUC = 0.755), identifying age, IgG levels, complement component 4 (C4), and absence of dry mouth as primary predictors. This approach offers a promising tool for early identification and management of AIT in pSS patients.

Eight landmarks, two lines and a coordinate system were defined on 3D bone models of knees based on weight-bearing CT and non-weight-bearing CT. The shift and tilt of patella in three orthogonal axes (Xshift, Yshift, Zshift, Xtilt, Ytilt, Ztilt) were evaluated. Xshift and Yshift were significantly higher, Zshift, Xtilt and Ytilt were significantly lower in WB condition than NWB condition (p < 0.001, p < 0.001, p = 0.001, p = 0.002, p = 0.010). In both WB and NWB conditions, Xshift, Yshift and Ztilt were significantly higher, and Xtilt was significantly lower in the RPD group than the control group (WB/NWB: p < 0.001/p = 0.002, p < 0.001/p = 0.001, p < 0.001/p < 0.001, p < 0.001/p = 0.009).

Ninety-four patients, including 55 with pathologically verified CRLM, were enrolled, totaling 422 lesions (287 metastatic, 135 benign). Two independent readers assessed three MRI protocols per patient: Protocol 1 included non-contrast sequences (T2-weighted turbo spin-echo, T1-weighted Dixon, diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI), and ADC mapping). Protocol 2 included gadoxetic acid enhancement with hepatobiliary phase imaging, T2 TSE, DWI, and ADC maps. Protocol 3 utilized the standard Gadoxetic Acid-enhanced MRI sequence, which included pre-contrast T1-weighted imaging, T1-weighted Dixon sequences, post-contrast T1-weighted imaging (including arterial, portal venous, transitional and hepatobiliary phases), and additional T2-weighted and DWI sequences. Diagnoses were scored on a 5-point scale (benign = 1; malignant = 5), with scores ≥ 3 indicating CRLM. ROC curves analyzed diagnostic accuracy, comparing area under the curve (AUC) values across protocols. No significant difference in AUCs was observed between Protocol 1 (0.899-0.909) and Protocol 2 (0.906-0.931) versus Protocol 3 (0.935-0.939) (p = 0.091-0.195). For lesions ≤ 10 mm, Protocol 1 was slightly inferior to Protocol 3 (p = 0.002-0.032), while Protocol 2 remained comparably effective (p = 0.096-0.179). These findings held when using a threshold of ≥ 4 to define CRLM. The non-enhanced abbreviated MRI protocol is as effective as the gadoxetic acid-enhanced protocol in identifying CRLM. The proposed Ab-MRI approach may be a viable alternative for CRLM surveillance. The non-enhanced abbreviated MRI (Ab-MRI) protocol is as effective as the gadoxetic acid-enhanced protocol in identifying colorectal liver metastasis (CRLM).

This single-center retrospective study included pathologically confirmed BCa patients who underwent preoperative contrast-enhanced DLCT. Patients were divided into low- and high-grade groups based on pathology. We measured and calculated the following spectral CT parameters: iodine density (ID), normalized ID (NID), arterial enhancement fraction (AEF), extracellular volume (ECV) fraction, virtual non-contrast (VNC), slope of the attenuation curve, and Z effective (Zeff). Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were used to determine the best predictive factors in differentiating between low- and high-grade BCa. We used receiver operating characteristic curve analysis to assess diagnostic performance and decision curve analysis to determine the net benefit. The study included 64 patients (mean age, 64 ± 11.0 years; 46 men), of whom 42 had high-grade BCa and 22 had low-grade BCa. Univariate analysis revealed that differences in ID and NID in the corticomedullary phase, AEF, ECV, VNC, and Zeff images were statistically significant (p = 0.001-0.048). Multivariable analysis found that AEF was the best predictor of high-grade tumors (p = 0.006). With AEF higher in high-grade BCa, AEF results were as follows: area under the curve (AUC), 0.924 (95% confidence interval, 0.861-0.988); sensitivity, 95.5%; specificity, 81.0%; and accuracy, 85.9%. The cutoff valve of AEF for predicting high-grade BCa was 67.7%. Using DLCT AEF could help distinguish high-grade from low-grade BCa. This research demonstrates that the arterial enhancement fraction (AEF), a parameter derived from dual-layer spectral detector CT (DLCT), effectively distinguishes between high- and low-grade bladder cancer, thereby aiding in the selection of appropriate clinical treatment strategies. This study investigated the value of dual-layer spectral detector CT in the assessment of bladder cancer (BCa) histological grade. The spectral parameter arterial enhancement fraction could help determine BCa grade.

Preoperative quantitative CTP parameters, including cerebral blood flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV), mean transit time (MTT), time to drain (TTD), and transit time to maximum of the residue function (Tmax), along with clinical data, were compared between the groups with and without post-CI. Predictors of post-CI were identified and assessed using multivariable logistic regression and receiver-operating characteristic curve analyses. Post-CI occurred in 11 patients (12.0%). In univariate analysis, preoperative mean values for CBF, MTT, TTD, Tmax, initial presentation, infarction within the 2 months before surgery, surgical side, and modified Rankin Scale score on admission were associated with post-CI (all p < 0.05). Multivariable logistic regression revealed that the preoperative mean Tmax (OR 2.342, 95% CI: 1.267-4.330, p = 0.007) and infarction within the 2 months before surgery (OR 14.345, 95% CI: 2.108-97.638, p = 0.006) were independent predictors of post-CI. The preoperative mean Tmax produced the largest area under the curve (0.955, 95% CI: 0.914-0.997) with a cutoff of 3.590 s (sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 87.7%). Adults with MMD are at risk of post-CI when the preoperative mean Tmax is > 3.590 s. Cerebral infarction during the 2 months before revascularization is also a risk factor for post-CI. Post-CI is a serious complication for adults with MMD following surgical revascularization. The risk of post-CI can be predicted using preoperative CTP parameters, which will assist neurosurgeons with surgical decisions and implementing individualized prophylactic strategies. Predicting the risk of post-CI in MMD patients is beneficial to their prognosis. The preoperative mean Tmax was an excellent perfusion parameter for predicting post-CI.

Retrospective analysis was conducted on non-contrast and contrast-enhanced CT scans containing pulmonary nodules measuring 5-30 mm. Ground truth was defined by histology or follow-up stability. The final analysis was performed on 297 patients with 422 eligible nodules, of which 105 nodules were malignant. Classification performance of the LCP-CNN, Brock model, and Lung-RADS® was evaluated in terms of diagnostic accuracy measurements including ROC-analysis for different subcohorts (total, screening, emphysema, and interstitial lung disease). LCP-CNN demonstrated superior performance compared to the Brock model in total and screening cohorts (AUC 0.92 (95% CI: 0.89-0.94) and 0.93 (95% CI: 0.89-0.96)). Superior sensitivity of LCP-CNN was demonstrated compared to the Brock model and Lung-RADS® in total, screening, and emphysema cohorts for a risk threshold of 5%. Superior sensitivity of LCP-CNN was also shown across all disease groups compared to the Brock model at a threshold of 65%, compared to Lung-RADS® sensitivity was better or equal. No significant differences in the performance of LCP-CNN were found between subcohorts. This study offers further evidence of the potential to integrate deep learning-based decision support systems into pulmonary nodule classification workflows, irrespective of the individual patient risk profile and underlying pulmonary disease. Question Is a deep-learning approach (LCP-CNN) superior to multiparametric models (Brock model, Lung-RADS®) in classifying pulmonary nodule risk across varied patient profiles? Findings LCP-CNN shows superior performance in risk classification of pulmonary nodules compared to multiparametric models with no significant impact on risk profiles and structural pulmonary diseases. Clinical relevance LCP-CNN offers efficiency and accuracy, addressing limitations of traditional models, such as variations in manual measurements or lack of patient data, while producing robust results.

An automated marker of NPH was developed and evaluated on clinical CT images, and its utility was assessed in a large patient cohort. A retrospective review was conducted of CT images from 306 tap test-responsive patients with NPH between January 2015 and January 2022. Control CT images were obtained from patients in the emergency department who were evaluated for headache and had unremarkable CT findings between June 2021 and August 2022. The ventricle-to-subarachnoid volume ratio (VSR) was automatically calculated by the imaging software and used as a predictor of NPH in linear regression modeling with adjustment for age and sex. The correlations of VSR with age, sex, and the receiver operating characteristic were computed. VSR was significantly greater in patients with NPH than controls (P < .001). Importantly, VSR was not significantly correlated with age (P = .56, R2 = 0.001). VSR identifies NPH with a sensitivity and specificity of 94.1% and 92.5%, respectively, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.99 (95% CI 0.975-0.995). Automated assessment of the VSR on head CT images identified probable NPH with 93% accuracy. The assessment of a large cohort of patients with NPH supports the generalizability of clinical screening of CT images.

This study aims to investigate the difference in FF between symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with ICAS and its potential optimal threshold. A total of 124 patients with ICAS with severe intracranial stenosis who had undergone cerebral angiography were recruited. According to the time of onset, the patients were divided into a symptomatic ICAS group (n=78) and an asymptomatic ICAS group (n=46). The Angio-FF of each group was collected and compared. Receiver-operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was performed to assess the discriminative ability of Angio-FF to predict hemodynamics for ICAS. Compared with the asymptomatic ICAS group, the symptomatic ICAS group had a significantly lower Angio-FF (0.75 (0.66-0.85) vs 0.85 (0.77-0.89), P<0.001). The optimal cut-off value of Angio-FF for distinguishing symptomatic ICAS from asymptomatic ICAS was 0.785 (sensitivity 71.74%, specificity 57.69%).

Both enantiomers showed significant stereoselectivity in vivo. The AUC0-72h of R-(-)-clethodim was 4.50 and 4.90 times that of S-(+)-clethodim in plasma after intragastric and intravenous administration, respectively. However, the bioavailability of R-(-)-clethodim (12.96%) was lower than that of S-(+)-clethodim (14.14%). S-(+)-clethodim was found in a relatively high abundance in most tissues. No mutual transformation between the two enantiomers was observed in vivo, indicating that configuration conversion did not contribute to the differences in the content of the enantiomers in the plasma and tissues. This may be due to the binding of clethodim enantiomers to serum albumin and acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which was verified by the molecular docking experiment.

However, no clinical tool has been developed to date to predict the risk of adverse events (AEs) during tooth extraction. We prospectively enrolled 774 elderly patients (aged ≥ 60 years) with cardiovascular disease (CVD) who were scheduled to undergo tooth extraction at the dental surgery department of Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital from January 2021 to July 2022. To determine the predictive risk factors for AEs, we collected and recorded 62 factors on general characteristics, clinical information, physical and imaging examinations, psychological tests, perioperative characteristics, and surgical characteristics. We used a univariate logistic regression model to explore the 62 potential risk factors and included 21 factors in a multivariate model (all P-values < 0.05). After stepwise selection, 11 factors, including age, systolic blood pressure, severe hypertension, history of pacemaker use, stroke, ejection fraction, valvular insufficiency, atrial premature beats, ventricular premature beats, extraction of more than one tooth and the General Health Questionnaire-28 score, were included in the predictive model (all P-values < 0.05). In the test group, the area under the curve was 0.893 (0.866, 0.919), sensitivity was 0.878 (0.827, 0.93), specificity was 0.735 (0.697, 0.773) and accuracy was 0.768 (0.736, 0.800). In the validation group, these values were 0.857 (0.760, 0.954), 0.938 (0.819, 1.056) and 0.524 (0.417, 0.631), respectively. We created a nomogram to predict the risk factors for AEs during tooth extraction. Mental status plays a critical role in the risk of adverse effects, and the blood pressure also has a key influence on the prediction of adverse effects. We developed and validated a predictive model with 11 clinical factors for the AEs during tooth extraction in elderly patients with CVD with well efficiency.","2025","Annals of medicine"

Heterologous expression of hTRPM8 in HEK293T cells was required for anti-TRPM8 antibody staining and TRPM8 agonist induced Ca2+ mobilization signals which were both used to optimize transfection efficiency. FLIPR Calcium 6 dye concentration, loading time, and TRPM8 transfected cell seeding density were optimized and a DMSO tolerance of ≤0.2 % was set. The resting baseline relative fluorescent unit (RFUs) signals of the TRPM8 Ca2+ mobilization assay exhibited substantial well-to-well variability, even though such differences were small relative to maximal agonist induced responses. Maximum RFU, cumulative RFU sum, or area under the curve values were extracted from Ca2+ mobilization kinetic data to plot curves and calculate EC50 and IC50 values. Fold over baseline (FOB) ratio data processing eliminated well-to-well differences in resting baseline signals, reduced error bars, improved curve fits and reduced 95 % confidence interval EC50 and IC50 ranges. FOB ratio data processing decreased variability and improved the precision of repeat measurements in single experimental sessions thereby reducing the minimum threshold difference in EC50 or IC50 values required to distinguish compound potencies. EC50 and IC50 values of TRPM8 agonists and antagonists determined in single experiments were strongly aligned to those from multiple independent experiments. Benchmark TRPM8, TRPV1, and TRPA1 EC50 and IC50 values were within the ranges previously reported for agonist and antagonist standards. The improved precision and accuracy of the TRP Ca2+ mobilization assays afforded by FOB ratio data processing enhances their utility for investigating structure activity relationships.","2025","SLAS discovery : advancing life sciences R & D"

This time-critical process requires the simultaneous pursuit of multiple resuscitation goals. Recognizing whether the required goal is being pursued can reduce errors in goal-related task performance and improve patient outcomes. The intention to pursue a goal can often be inferred from ongoing and completed treatment activities, but monitoring goal pursuit is cognitively demanding and prone to errors. We introduced an interpretable deep learning-based approach to aid decision making by automatically recognizing goal pursuit during trauma resuscitation. We developed a predictive model to recognize the pursuit of two resuscitation goals: airway stabilization and circulatory support. We used event logs of 381 pediatric trauma resuscitations from August 2014 to November 2022 to train a neural network model with a dual-GRU structure that learns from both time-level and activity-type-level features. Our model makes predictions based on a sequence of activities and corresponding timestamps. To enhance the model and facilitate interpretation of predictions, we used the attention weights assigned by our model to represent the importance of features. These weights identified the critical time points and contributing activities during a goal pursuit. Our model achieved an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) score of 0.84 for recognizing airway stabilization and 0.83 for recognizing circulatory support. The most contributing activities and timestamps were aligned with domain knowledge. Our interpretable predictive model can recognize provider intention based on a limited number of treatment activities. The model outperformed existing predictive models for medical events in accuracy and in interpretability. Integrating our model into a decision-support system would automate the tracking of provider actions, optimizing workflow to ensure timely delivery of care.","2025","Journal of biomedical informatics"
1103,"39746430","Unveiling pathology-related predictive uncertainty of glomerular lesion recognition using prototype learning.","Recognizing glomerular lesions is essential in diagnosing chronic kidney disease. However, deep learning faces challenges due to the lesion heterogeneity, superposition, progression, and tissue incompleteness, leading to uncertainty in model predictions. Therefore, it is crucial to analyze pathology-related predictive uncertainty in glomerular lesion recognition and unveil its relationship with pathological properties and its impact on model performance. This paper presents a novel framework for pathology-related predictive uncertainty analysis towards glomerular lesion recognition, including prototype learning based predictive uncertainty estimation, pathology-characterized correlation analysis and weight-redistributed prediction rectification. The prototype learning based predictive uncertainty estimation includes deep prototyping, affinity embedding, and multi-dimensional uncertainty fusion. The pathology-characterized correlation analysis is the first to use expert-based and learning- based approach to construct the pathology-related characterization of lesions and tissues. The weight-redistributed prediction rectification module performs reweighting- based lesion recognition. To validate the performance, extensive experiments were conducted. Based on the Spearman and Pearson correlation analysis, the proposed framework enables more efficient correlation analysis, and strong correlation with pathology-related characterization can be achieved (c index > 0.6 and p < 0.01). Furthermore, the prediction rectification module demonstrated improved lesion recognition performance across most metrics, with enhancements of up to 6.36 %. The proposed predictive uncertainty analysis in glomerular lesion recognition offers a valuable approach for assessing computational pathology's predictive uncertainty from a pathology-related perspective. The paper provides a solution for pathology-related predictive uncertainty estimation in algorithm development and clinical practice.","2025","Journal of biomedical informatics"

To understand the mechanisms and identify potential biomarkers related to prediabetes trajectories, we compared the proteomics and metabolomics profile of people with prediabetes progressing to diabetes or reversing to normoglycemia within 1 year. The fasting plasma concentrations of 1,389 proteins and the fasting, 30-min, and 120-min post-oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) plasma concentrations of 152 metabolites were measured in up to 134 individuals with new-onset diabetes, prediabetes, or normal glucose tolerance. For 108 participants, the analysis was repeated with samples from 1 year before, when all had prediabetes. The plasma concentrations of 14 proteins were higher in diabetes compared with normoglycemia in a population with prediabetes 1 year before, and they correlated with indices of insulin sensitivity. Higher levels of dicarbonyl/L-xylulose reductase and glutathione S-transferase A3 in the prediabetic state were associated with an increased risk of diabetes 1 year later. Pathway analysis pointed toward differences in immune response between diabetes and normoglycemia that were already recognizable in the prediabetic state 1 year prior at baseline. The area under the curve during OGTT of the concentrations of IDL particles, IDL apolipoprotein B, and IDL cholesterol was higher in new-onset diabetes compared with normoglycemia. The concentration of glutamate increased in prediabetes progressing to diabetes. We identify new candidates associated with the progression of prediabetes to diabetes or its remission to normoglycemia. Pathways regulating the immune response are related to prediabetes trajectories.","2025","Diabetes care"

Although postoperative internal rotation deficits occur, their impact on outcomes of total shoulder arthroplasty (TSA) is not well established. Previous authors have validated the Single Assessment Numeric Evaluation (SANE) as a patient-reported assessment of acceptable outcomes of TSA. (1) Is there an association between postoperative internal rotation and acceptable outcomes following TSA as assessed by SANE? (2) Is there a threshold for internal rotation after TSA beyond which increasing internal rotation no longer improves odds of acceptable outcomes? A single institution's longitudinally maintained shoulder arthroplasty registry was used to identify patients undergoing primary anatomic or reverse TSA (RTSA). The registry provides postoperative patient-reported outcomes, including SANE scores. Postoperatively, patients complete a previously validated ROM self-assessment to quantify their current abduction, forward elevation, external rotation in adduction and abduction, and internal rotation in adduction. Data on patient age, preoperative Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System mental health scores, gender, surgery performed, and hand dominance were also obtained. In all, 784 patient-reported surveys were available. Thirty-four percent (268 of 784) of the surveys were collected at 1 year, 52% (410 of 784) at 2 years, 11% (87 of 784) at 5 years, and 2% (19 of 784) at 10 years. More than 50% percent (446 of 784) of patients underwent RTSA, 48% were men, and the mean ± SD age was 68 ± 8 years at the time of surgery. A logistic multivariate analysis was used to assess the association of internal rotation with an acceptable outcome (defined as a SANE score of > 75%). A receiver operating characteristic curve was used to assess an internal rotation threshold associated with an acceptable SANE score. After accounting for age, gender, hand dominance, pain level, and surgical procedure, patients with internal rotation below the upper back had lower odds of achieving a SANE score of > 75% (p < 0.05). The threshold for SANE scores > 75% was identified to be internal rotation to the midback and higher, resulting in an area under the curve of 0.71 (95% CI 0.67 to 0.75; p < 0.001) with sensitivity of 57% (95% CI 0.56 to 0.58) and specificity of 75% (95% CI 0.73 to 0.77). After shoulder arthroplasty, shoulder normalcy was associated with postoperative internal rotation. Although our study has not proven a causal relationship between limited internal rotation and poorer SANE scores, our clinical experience combined with these findings suggests that limited internal rotation indeed is likely clinically important in this context, and so addressing postoperative internal rotation deficits, especially for RTSA, may improve the quality of shoulder arthroplasty. Further research is needed to understand the modifiable factors that prevent sufficient internal rotation following shoulder arthroplasty.

Adherence to RASA medications, defined as having a proportion of days covered (PDC) of at least 80%, has been improving for several years, suggesting that further investigation is needed to assess the appropriateness of the current 80% PDC threshold for medication adherence as an indicator of quality. The 80% PDC threshold has been found to be associated with improved health care resource utilization outcomes; however, little evidence exists to show that this threshold is optimal. To evaluate the association between adherence to RASA medications and health care resource utilization outcomes within a Medicare Advantage population and to identify the optimal PDC threshold that maximizes economic and utilization benefits. This retrospective cohort study used de-identified administrative claims data from the 2015 to 2018 in Optum's de-identified Clinformatics Data Mart Database. Inclusion in the study was based on measure specifications for the RASA adherence measure used in the Medicare Part D Star Ratings program. Adherence was assessed over a 1-year period, and health care utilization and medical costs were assessed in the subsequent year. Multivariable logistic regression models were used to assess the relationship between adherence and economic outcomes after accounting for hypothesized confounders. A total of 1,006,901 individuals were included in the study with an average PDC of 87.5% (SD = 17.8%). During the follow-up period, 12.1% of individuals experienced a hospitalization, 14.81% used an emergency department (ED), and 32.3% visited a non-ED outpatient facility. Each percentage point increase in PDC was significantly associated with decreased odds of hospitalization (odds ratio [OR] = 0.997; 95% CI = 0.997-0.997) and ED visit (OR = 0.997; 95% CI = 0.996-0.997), being in the top decile of payer medical costs (OR = 0.998; 95% CI = 0.997-0.998), and increased odds of outpatient visits (adjusted OR = 1.001; 95% CI = 1.001-1.002). Receiver operator characteristic curve analyses found the optimal PDC thresholds to be 91.5%, 90.7%, 90.7%, and 90.4% for hospitalization (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.527), ED visit (AUC = 0.534), outpatient visit (AUC = 0.501), and medical costs (AUC = 0.532), respectively. This study demonstrated the importance of medication adherence for preventing undesirable outcomes, such as future hospitalizations, ED visits, and high medical costs, among individuals with hypertension enrolled in Medicare Advantage. The optimal threshold for PDC related to health care resource utilization outcomes was found to be greater than that used in the measure in CMS Star Ratings. Future research should examine the impact of changes in adherence thresholds for economic and clinical outcomes.","2025","Journal of managed care & specialty pharmacy"

Our objective was to develop predictive models for CPAP outcomes and assess whether the inclusion of physiological traits enhances prediction. Methods: We constructed predictive models from baseline information for subsequent residual apnea-hypopnea index (AHI) and optimal CPAP pressure. We compared models utilizing clinical variables with those incorporating both clinical and physiological factors. Furthermore, we assessed the performance of regression versus machine learning. All performances, including root mean square error (RSME), R-squared, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC), were evaluated using a five-fold cross validation with ten repeats. Results: For predicting residual AHI, random forest models outperformed regression models, and models that incorporated both clinical and physiological variables also outperformed models using only clinical variables across all performance metrics. Random forest using both clinical features and physiological traits achieved the best performance. In both regression and random forest models, central apnea index is found to be the most important feature in predicting residual AHI. For predicting CPAP pressure, there was no additional predictive value of physiological traits or random forest modeling. Conclusions: Our findings demonstrated that the combined use of clinical and physiological variables yields the most robust predictive models for residual AHI, with random forest models performing best. These findings support the notion that prediction of OSA therapy outcomes may be improved by more flexible models using machine learning, potentially in combination with physiology-based models.","2025","Journal of clinical sleep medicine : JCSM : official publication of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine"

A retrospective observational cross-sectional study was conducted with 2,527 urine samples from patients of a quaternary hospital in Brazil. Urine samples were processed simultaneously in Sysmex UF-5000 flow cytometry analyzer (urinalysis) and MALDI-TOF (culture). For all samples, a cutoff of 123.8 bacteria/µL was established to discriminate culture-negative specimens. ROC curve indicated the following cutoffs for females and males, respectively: 193.65 and 23.55 bacteria/µL, and 21.35 and 5.05 squamous epithelial cells (SEC)/µL, with the latter two related to scenarios of sample contamination/colonization through mixed cultures. Performing univariate logistic regression, we found a 2.78 (CI95 %: 2.12-3.65) times higher chance of probable mixed culture when SEC values were above the cutoffs for each sex, and 6.91(CI95 %: 4.56-10.47) times for bacteria. For multivariate logistic regression, the OR values were 1.62 (CI95 %: 1.21-2.15) and 5.82 (CI95 %: 3.77-8.98), respectively. The fluorescent flow cytometry analyzers could efficiently identify urinary bacteria counts associated with contamination/colonization scenarios using the cutoffs of 21.35 SEC/µL for women and 5.05 SEC/µL for men. The cutoffs for bacteria/µL (193.65 for females and 23.55 for males) indicated that the presence of bacteria in male samples may be more associated with urinary tract infections (UTIs), while in female samples, it may be associated with either UTIs or contamination/colonization scenarios.

Meal carbohydrate content is an important predictor of PPGR, but dietary interventions to mitigate PPGR are not always successful. A personalized approach, considering behaviour and habitual pattern of glucose excursions assessed by continuous glucose monitor (CGM), may be more effective. Data were collected under free-living conditions, over 2 weeks, in older adults (age 60 ± 7, BMI 33.0 ± 6.6 kg/m2), with prediabetes (n = 35) or early onset type 2 diabetes (n = 3), together with sleep and physical activity by actigraphy. We assessed the predictive value of habitual CGM glucose excursions and fasting glucose on PPGR after a research meal (hereafter MEAL-PPGR) and during an oral glucose tolerance test (hereafter OGTT-PPGR). Mean amplitude of glucose excursions (MAGE) and fasting glucose were highly predictive of all measures of OGTT-PPGR (AUC, peak, delta, mean glucose and glucose at 120 min; R2 between 0.616 and 0.786). Measures of insulin sensitivity and β-cell function (Matsuda index, HOMA-B and HOMA-IR) strengthened the prediction of fasting glucose and MAGE (R2 range 0.651 to 0.832). Similarly, MAGE and premeal glucose were also strong predictors of MEAL-PPGR (R2 range 0.546 to 0.722). Meal carbohydrates strengthened the prediction of 3 h AUC (R2 increase from 0.723 to 0.761). Neither anthropometrics, age nor habitual sleep and physical activity added to the prediction models significantly.

This study aimed to investigate the association between eGDR and various CVD events, including myocardial infarction (MI), heart failure (HF), atrial fibrillation (AF) and ischemic stroke. Additionally, the predictive values of eGDR, triglyceride-glucose (TyG) index, TyG-waist circumference (WC), TyG-body mass index (BMI), TyG-waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), triglyceride (TG)-to-high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) ratio (TG/HDL-C) and the metabolic score for insulin resistance (METS-IR) for CVD events were compared. The study population was extracted from the UK Biobank, and the CVD events were documented by linking to hospital records. Cox proportional hazards model and the restricted cubic spline model were used to assess the association between eGDR and the risk of CVDs with adjustment for potential confounders. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the area under the curve (AUC) were used to compare the predictive values of eGDR, TyG, TyG-WC, TyG-BMI, TyG-WHtR, TG/HDL-C and METS-IR.

Below a set point threshold, airborne isolation precautions are automatically discontinued; otherwise, additional evaluation, including infection control review, is recommended. The model was validated through retrospective application of the CDSS to all individuals hospitalized in the Mass General Brigham system from July 2016 to December 2022 with culture-confirmed pulmonary TB (cases) and equal numbers of age and date of testing-matched controls with three negative respiratory mycobacterial cultures. 104 individuals with TB (cases) and 104 controls were identified. Prior residence in a highly endemic country, positive interferon release assay, weight loss, absence of symptom resolution with treatment for alternative diagnoses, and findings concerning for TB on chest imaging were significant predictors of TB (all P < 0.05). CDSS contents and scoring were refined based on the case-control analysis. The final CDSS demonstrated 100% sensitivity and 27% specificity for TB with an AUC of 0.87. The TBorNotTB CDSS demonstrated modest specificity and high sensitivity to detect TB even when AFB smears were negative.

Capillary isoelectric focusing (cIEF) is a high-resolution separation for proteins and peptides which is capable of separating proteoforms. MS detection coupled to cIEF can separate, detect, and characterize proteoforms at the molecular level. However, cIEF with MS detection is a compromised process.

This research aimed to evaluate the diagnostic benefits of baseline testing in acute concussion assessment compared with normative reference values and characterize the athletes who receive the most diagnostic utility from baseline testing. Cohort study (Diagnosis); Level of evidence, 2. The investigators selected athletes from the National Collegiate Athletic Association-Department of Defense (NCAA-DoD) Concussion Assessment, Research, and Education (CARE) Consortium with at least 2 baseline assessments and 1 concussion. Two predictive models were developed that mimic acute concussion assessment using multivariate logistic regression based on a battery of postural control, neurocognitive status, and symptom assessments. The first predictive model gives a concussion status prediction based on change scores computed using individualized baseline testing information, whereas the second model uses normative reference values. The investigators defined and computed a novel metric called the Diagnostic Utility of Baseline Testing by comparing the concussion status predicted by each of these predictive models. The Diagnostic Utility of Baseline distribution was analyzed across athlete demographic characteristics and medical history. The study included 1081 collegiate athletes (43.9% female) with 1279 acute concussion assessments (24- to 48-hour postinjury assessments) and 1551 reference assessments (baseline and 6-month assessments). Both the baseline and normative models exhibited notably high area under the curve values of .89 and .90, respectively. Most athletes (86.7%) did not gain additional diagnostic benefits from baseline testing versus normative values. Those with Hispanic ethnicity (P = .038) or a history of psychiatric disorders (P < .001) or depression (P = .002) were more likely to be correctly identified as having acute concussion when change scores were derived from normative values instead of individualized baseline values. This study highlights that the additional diagnostic benefit of preseason baseline testing over normative data is limited for most collegiate student-athletes. Thus, normative data can be used for most collegiate student-athletes in the absence of baseline testing. Moreover, these results can inform decisions on the allocation of baseline tests in resource-limited athletic settings, emphasizing the need for targeted concussion assessment strategies based on individual characteristics.","2025","The American journal of sports medicine"

These 2 methods of detecting hyperkalemia have not been compared. To determine the accuracy of POC and ECG potassium measurements for hyperkalemia detection in patients with critical illness. This retrospective study involved intensive care patients in an academic medical center from October 2020 to September 2021. Patients who had 12-lead ECG, POC potassium measurement, and central laboratory potassium measurement within 1 hour were included. The POC potassium measurements were obtained from arterial blood gas analysis; ECG potassium measurements were calculated by a previously developed deep learning model. Hyperkalemia was defined as a central laboratory potassium measurement of 5.5 mEq/L or greater. Fifteen patients with hyperkalemia and 252 patients without hyperkalemia were included. The POC and ECG potassium measurements were available about 35 minutes earlier than central laboratory results. Correlation with central laboratory potassium measurement was better for POC testing than for ECG (mean absolute errors of 0.211 mEq/L and 0.684 mEq/L, respectively). For POC potassium measurement, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) to detect hyperkalemia was 0.933, sensitivity was 73.3%, and specificity was 98.4%. For ECG potassium measurement, AUC was 0.884, sensitivity was 93.3%, and specificity was 63.5%. The ECG potassium measurement, with its high sensitivity and coverage rate, may be used initially and followed by POC potassium measurement for rapid detection of life-threatening hyperkalemia.","2025","American journal of critical care : an official publication, American Association of Critical-Care Nurses"

In a 12-wk parallel arm, randomized controlled trial, we recruited 120 participants with prediabetes based on American Diabetes Association criteria. The intervention group (n = 60) consumed 60 g pistachios (30 g prebreakfast and predinner) whereas the control group (n = 60) followed a routine diet that excluded nuts. At baseline and 12 wk, we collected blood samples for biochemical analysis, anthropometrics, and 24-h recalls. Participants wore a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor during the trial's first and last 2 wk. Urinary N-methyl-trans-4-hydroxy-l-proline (MHP) was measured as a marker of pistachio consumption. A total of 109 participants completed the study (follow-up rate = 90.8%). Compared with participants in the control group, those in the intervention group had significant reductions in HbA1c (mean between-group difference: -0.2; 95% confidence interval: -0.3, -0.1; P < 0.001] with no significant changes in fasting or 2-h post glucose load plasma glucose. Compared with the control group, the intervention group had significant reductions in serum triglyceride, waist circumference, lipid accumulation product, visceral adiposity index, and atherogenic index.

Therefore, the identification and mapping of flood-prone areas is crucial for flood disaster management. The main objective of this study is to identify and map the potential flood areas of the Wardha Basin using frequency ratio (FR) and statistical index (SI) models. The analysis was based on twelve determinants such as elevation, slope, aspect, curvature, topographic wetness index (TWI), stream power index (SPI), rainfall, distance from the river, stream density, soil types, land use/land cover (LULC) and distance from the road. The flood inventory map was prepared based on 377 flood sites. Flood locations were randomly classified as 70% training samples (264 flood points) and 30% (113) testing samples. According to the FR model, approximately 1% of the area belongs to the very high flood vulnerability category and 39% to the very low flood vulnerability category. On the other hand, the SI model results showed that 4161 km2 (7%) of the basin area is very high susceptible to flooding, while very low flood sensitivity covers 6011 km2 (13%) of the basin area. A comparative analysis of the FR and SI models showed that the SI model is very accurate for the Wardha Basin because it has a higher area under the curve (AUC) for success rate (88.24%) than FR (86.99%).

Therefore, we evaluated the association between suspected methotrexate pharmacogenomic variants and methotrexate-related neurotoxicity. This study included children (aged 2-20 years) diagnosed with ALL (2005-2019) at six treatment centers in the southwest United States. Clinical information was abstracted from medical records. Suspected neurotoxic events occurring within 21 days of intravenous and/or intrathecal methotrexate delivered between the end of induction and start of maintenance therapy were independently reviewed by at least two pediatric oncologists. Germline DNA was genotyped and 97 methotrexate pharmacogenomic variants of interest with at least grade 3 evidence were identified using the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base. Associations between variants and neurotoxicity were assessed by logistic regression. Data were randomly split (80/20) and random forest was constructed to estimate the ability of the variants to correctly classify neurotoxicity. Of the 763 patients included in the study, 8.2% (n = 63) developed methotrexate-associated neurotoxicity. In logistic models, none of the 97 available pharmacogenomic variants reached adjusted statistical significance. However, two variants, rs17222723 (odds ratio [OR] = 2.83 [ref. = T allele], 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.20-6.15) in ABCC2 and rs1045642 (OR = 0.66 [ref. = minor A allele], 95% CI: 0.44-0.98) in ABCB1, were nominally associated (p-value < 0.05) with neurotoxicity susceptibility. The addition of pharmacogenomic variants did not improve the predictive performance of random forest model (AUC = 0.73) compared to clinical information alone (AUC = 0.74). Overall, our results suggest that associations between neurotoxicity susceptibility and methotrexate pharmacogenomic variants are generally modest and these variants do not significantly improve neurotoxicity risk stratification among children with ALL.","2025","Pharmacotherapy"

In order to support medical decisions, we aimed to predict response to fingolimod compared to placebo, by developing and validating prognostic multivariable models. We included two-year follow-up from intention-to-treat populations of two multi-country placebo-controlled randomized controlled trials (RCT) of daily fingolimod 0.5 mg. The data was accessed via ClinicalStudyDataRequest.com (Proposal Number: 11223) The RCTs were in adult RRMS patients with active disease. We used four Cox proportional hazards based penalized (elastic net and grouped lasso) and tree methods (transformation tree and forest) to predict time-to relapse and other relevant efficacy and safety endpoints in data from the RCT FREEDOMS. Treatment arm, 80 baseline variables and their interaction with treatment were considered as candidate predictors in the models. A nested cross-validation scheme ensured independent tuning parameter optimization and internal model performance evaluation. The generalizability of the models with the highest cross-validated time-dependent area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) was further evaluated in terms of discrimination (AUC), calibration (plots, intercept, slope), clinical utility (decision curve analysis), and treatment response plots by external validation in data from the RCT FREEDOMS II. The best performing model predicting relapse risk (331 events) in the development sample (n=843) was an elastic net regression with main terms for four predictors alongside treatment: EDSS score, volume of Gadolinium enhanced T1 lesions, number of relapses in the last 2 years, and number of prior MS treatments. In external validation (n=713), it had an AUC of 0.68 (95% CI 0.63-0.72), but the predictions were overestimating the actual risk (358 events) with a calibration-in-the-large of -0.17 (-0.3 - -0.04) and a slope of 1.06 (0.78-1.35). Almost no heterogeneity (variability 0.001) was detected in the predicted relapse risk change in response to fingolimod. FREEDOMS II participants were predicted to have 0.21 to 0.31 absolute relapse risk reduction with fingolimod compared to placebo. The selected model predicting new or enlarging T2 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) lesions had an AUC of 0.74 (0.70-0.78), moderate calibration, but no treatment response variability. The final model predicting confirmed disability progression had an AUC of 0.59 (0.54-0.64) and the predicted treatment response heterogeneity was not significant. The overall safety outcome could not be predicted with sufficient discrimination. However, the final model predicting infections or neoplasms had an AUC of 0.69 (0.63-0.74) and non-significant treatment response heterogeneity. For the efficacy outcomes, important predictors were related to (para)clinical disease activity or disability. Unexpected influential predictors included concomitant disorders. Relapse and new or enlarging T2 MRI lesions were moderately predictable in an independent sample with the developed prognostic models. Fingolimod was expected to decrease the risk of these events for all patients, with no predictable heterogeneity. Disability and safety outcomes could not be well-predicted and it is yet unresolved whether the change in their risk as response to fingolimod is heterogeneous or not.","2025","Multiple sclerosis and related disorders"

Significant heterogeneity in clinical characteristics and course of depression hinders treatment success. Efforts to identify more homogeneous subgroups of depression could reduce heterogeneity of depression and therefore improve treatment development and randomized clinical trial outcomes. Event-related potentials (ERPs) derived from continuous electroencephalogram (EEG) can be used to identify depression and predict course (i.e., advance precision psychiatry). In the current study, we demonstrate how multiple ERPs collected from the same individual across different experimental paradigms can provide insight into brain function and individual differences in depression using factor analysis. This approach for neurotyping depression exploits the high within-task and low between-task associations between ERPs to better understand brain function and depression. We observed three neurotypes, two of which differentiated depressed from non-depressed individuals. Only one neurotype - related to affective processing - prospectively predicted full remission. This neurotype predicted remission even when accounting for other clinical and demographic variables related to subsequent remission. The AUC of this neurotype was acceptable (i.e., 0.72) in predicting remission, exceeding previous study's measures within a single task. Leveraging multiple ERPs derived from many tasks is an important yet underutilized approach in precision psychiatry.","2025","Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry"

However, O2, as the most commonly used oxidant, tends to result in inevitable overoxidation and waste of methane feedstock. Herein, we first report a photocatalytic OCM using CO2 as a soft oxidant for C2H6 production under mild conditions, where an efficient photocatalyst with unique interface sites is designed and constructed to facilitate CO2 adsorption and activation, while concurrently boosting CH4 dissociation. As a prototype, the Au quantum dots anchored on oxygen-deficient TiO2 nanosheets are fabricated, where the Au-Vo-Ti interface sites for CO2 adsorption and activation are collectively disclosed by in situ Kelvin probe force microscopy, quasi in situ X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and theoretical calculations. Compared with single metal site, the Au-Vo-Ti interface sites exhibit the lower CO2 adsorption energy and decrease the energy barrier of the *CO2 hydrogenation step from 1.05 to 0.77 eV via Au-C and Ti-O dual-site bonding. The adsorbed CO2 on the photocatalyst reduces the energy barrier of *CH4 dissociation to *CH3 from 2.13 to 1.59 eV, contributing to CH4 oxidation. Additionally, in situ Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy unveils the Au site facilitates ethane production by engaging in *CH3-Au interaction and accelerating CH3-CH3 coupling. Thus, the photocatalyst demonstrates a high C2H6 evolution rate of 2.60 mmol g-1 h-1 for OCM using CO2 as the soft oxidant, surpassing most of previously reported photocatalysts regardless of OCM and nonoxidative coupling of methane. This work highlights the importance of soft oxidants for improving oxidation reaction efficiency and provides atomic scale insight into the design of photocatalysts for CH4 conversion.","2025","Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English)"

This study aims to use machine learning and deep learning algorithms to develop a prediction model of MPA exposure for pediatric autoimmune diseases with optimizing sampling frequency. Pediatric autoimmune patients' data were collected at Nanfang Hospital between June 2018 and June 2023. Univariate analysis was applied for feature selection. Ten algorithms, including Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, Gradient Boosting Decision Tree, CatBoost, Artificial Neural Network, Grandient Boosting Machine, Transformer, Wide&Deep, and TabNet, were employed for modeling based on two, three, or four concentrations of MPA. A total of 614 MPA AUC0-12h samples from 209 patients were enrolled. Among the 10 models evaluated, the Wide&Deep model exhibited the best predictive performance. The predictive performance of the Wide&Deep model using four and three blood concentration points was similar (R 2 ≈ 1 for four points; R 2 = 0.95 for three points). No significant difference in accuracy within ±30% was observed between models utilizing three and four blood concentration points (p = 0.06). This study demonstrates that in the Wide&Deep model, MPA exposure can be accurately estimated with three sampling points in children with autoimmune diseases.

We used 8 rumen-cannulated cows in a replicated 4 × 4 Latin square experiment with 16-d periods. Treatments were (1) abomasal infusion of water (control), (2) abomasal infusion of free His, Lys, and Met (FAA), (3) administration of RPHis + RPLys + RPMet1 (rumen-protected methionine protected with ethyl cellulose; RPAA1), and (4) administration of RPHis + RPLys + RPMet2 (rumen-protected methionine protected with a pH-sensitive polymer; RPAA2). On d 7 of each experimental period, a pulse-dose of water (control) or FAA were infused into the abomasum of the cows, or RPAA were placed directly in the rumen, and blood samples were taken from the jugular vein through a catheter 11 times over a 24-h period for the AUC method. Following the AA pulse-dose, infusion lines were installed into the abomasum for continuous infusion of FAA for the PDR method, or RPAA were fed from d 12 to d 16 and cows were fitted with urinary catheters for total collection of feces for the FFAA method. Fecal collection and blood sampling were conducted from d 14 to 16. Due to technical issues likely leading to unrealistic BA estimates, data for the PDR method are reported in the supplemental material. Relative BA based on the AUC method (computed as AUC of RPAA treatment plasma AA concentration divided by AUC of FAA treatment plasma AA concentration) was lower for RPMet1 compared with RPMet2 (43% vs. 61%) and was 45% (SEM = 3.35) and 72% (SEM = 5.99), for RPHis and RPLys, respectively. Rumen escape fractions of RPAA, estimated in a previous study using an in situ method, and digestibility data from the current study were used for calculations of BA for the FFAA method. Bioavailability based on the FFAA method was lower for RPMet1 (67%) compared with RPMet2 (91%) and was 87% (SEM = 0.71) and 75% (SEM = 2.75) for RPHis and RPLys, respectively. The relative differences in estimated BA based on both the AUC and FFAA methods between the RPMet products were as expected, based on literature, and data for all 4 RPAA products corresponded well with previously estimated BA using the FFAA method. The unrealistic data for the PDR method were likely caused by technical deviations from the original method (e.g., once-daily dosing of RPAA and inability to capture representative plasma concentration data with the sampling time points). Therefore, comparison of the PDR method with the AUC and FFAA methods were not possible in this study. Further comparisons are needed without deviations from the original PDR method. Variability in BA data and differences in estimated BA between the in vivo methods highlight the current challenges for accurate measurements of relative in vivo BA of RPAA products. Different protection technologies may call for different methodology to be used for BA estimations. Further research and standardization of in vivo BA methods are warranted.","2025","Journal of dairy science"

Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed to evaluate the ability of maximum diameter (D-max) of IFA to predict cesarean-hysterectomy need. The study was completed with 49 women who underwent a cesarean-section with uterus-sparing surgery (n = 22) and a cesarean-hysterectomy (n = 27). Outer placental-half extension of IFA and each 1 mm increase in IFA D-max >3.5 mm were associated with a 58.82- and 3.52-fold increased risk of cesarean-hysterectomy, respectively. An IFA D-max of >3.5 mm was associated with cesarean-hysterectomy need at any PAS stage [area under the curve (AUC) = 0.845, 95 % CI:0.71-0.93, p < 0.001)] and in PAS 2 patients (AUC = 0.750, 95 % CI:0.56-0.89, p = 0.010), in whom prenatal prediction of cesarean-hysterectomy need is difficult. Evaluation of D-max and outer placental-half extension of IFA along with other markers of PAS improved the ability of ultrasonography to predict cesarean-hysterectomy need.","2025","Placenta"
1132,"39723763","pH-Adjusted Liquid SERS Approach: Toward a Reliable Plasma-Based Early Stage Lung Cancer Detection.","Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) provides a rapid and nondestructive method for biological plasma analysis, offering unparalleled sensitivity and specificity. However, most current studies predominantly employ the drop-cast method, where liquid samples are dried on the SERS substrate for spectral recording. While effective, this method is both time-consuming and inconsistent. Additionally, the Raman spectral signal of uric acid in plasma often dominates, overshadowing other crucial biomarkers necessary for disease differentiation. In this study, we present the application of label-free SERS detection for distinguishing early stage lung cancer (LC) from healthy controls (HC) using plasma samples. Plasma was diluted, adjusted to a weakly acidic pH, and combined with silver nanoparticles (Ag NPs) for SERS analysis. To maintain the plasma in a liquid state and prevent evaporation, liquid paraffin was employed. Our findings indicate that a 10-fold dilution of plasma under weakly acidic conditions significantly enhanced diagnostic performance, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.975. This method is featured by its simplicity and high efficiency, presenting a promising strategy for the minimally invasive diagnosis of early stage LC using SERS technology.","2025","Analytical chemistry"

In this context, this study's objective is to conduct a meta-analysis to compare and assess existing prognostic models designed for predicting in-hospital mortality in HF patients. A systematic search of databases was conducted, including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library up to January 2023. To ensure comprehensiveness, we performed an additional search in June 2023. The Prediction Model Risk of Bias Assessment Tool was employed to assess the validity and reliability of ML models. Our analysis incorporated 28 studies involving a total of 106 predictive models based on 14 different ML techniques. In the training data set, these models showed a combined C-index of 0.781, sensitivity of 0.56, and specificity of 0.94. In the validation data set, the models exhibited a combined C-index of 0.758, sensitivity of 0.57, and specificity of 0.84. Logistic regression (LR) was the most frequently used ML algorithm. LR models in the training set had a combined C-index of 0.795, sensitivity of 0.63, and specificity of 0.85, and these measures for LR models in the validation set were 0.751, 0.66, and 0.79, respectively. Our study indicates that although ML is increasingly being leveraged to predict in-hospital mortality for HF patients, the predictive performance remains suboptimal. Although these models have relatively high C-index and specificity, their ability to predict positive events is limited, as indicated by their low sensitivity.","2025","Clinical cardiology"

We comparatively analyzed N- and O-glycans in the pretreatment serum of 27 treatment-naïve patients with typical CIDP and 20 age- and sex-matched healthy controls (HC) using mass spectrometry. We determined the association between clinical parameters and glycans. The serum glycan and neurofilament light-chain (NfL) levels were assessed at the baseline, and treatment response was defined according to the degree of improvement in the modified Rankin scale 12 weeks after the first dose of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg). Compared with the HC, the CIDP group demonstrated significantly lower levels of serum total N-glycans (CIDP, median 973.3 [IQR 836.2-1131.3] pmol/μL; HC, 1125.0 [1005.0-1236.2] pmol/μL; p < 0.05), especially sialylated N-glycans (CIDP, 898.0 [752.2-1037.2] pmol/μL; HC, 1064.4 [942.7-1189.8] pmol/μL; p < 0.01). In contrast, the O-glycan levels did not differ significantly between the two groups. The treatment response was associated with low N-glycan levels, but not with the serum NfL levels. Low levels of sialylated N-glycans were associated with resistance to treatment over 12 weeks, with an area under the curve of 0.822 (p < 0.01). Low levels of sialylated N-glycans could potentially serve as a novel biomarker, reflecting pathophysiology and therapeutic resistance in typical CIDP.","2025","European journal of neurology"

Zhengqing Fengtongning (ZF) is a traditional Chinese medicine preparation used to treat RA. ZF may cause liver injury. In this study, we aimed to develop a prediction model for abnormal liver function caused by ZF. This retrospective study collected data from multiple centers from January 2018 to April 2023. Abnormal liver function was set as the target variable according to the alanine transaminase (ALT) level. Features were screened through univariate analysis and sequential forward selection for modeling. Ten machine learning and deep learning models were compared to find the model that most effectively predicted liver function from the available data. This study included 1,913 eligible patients. The LightGBM model exhibited the best performance (accuracy = 0.96) out of the 10 learning models. The predictive metrics of the LightGBM model were as follows: precision = 0.99, recall rate = 0.97, F1_score = 0.98, area under the curve (AUC) = 0.98, sensitivity = 0.97 and specificity = 0.85 for predicting ALT < 40 U/L; precision = 0.60, recall rate = 0.83, F1_score = 0.70, AUC = 0.98, sensitivity = 0.83 and specificity = 0.97 for predicting 40 ≤ ALT < 80 U/L; and precision = 0.83, recall rate = 0.63, F1_score = 0.71, AUC = 0.97, sensitivity = 0.63 and specificity = 1.00 for predicting ALT ≥ 80 U/L.

Multidimensional CT (MDCT) is the main imaging mortality for the diagnosis of SLT but it enhances the risk of contrast-induced nephropathy. Our study aimed to use an innovative wearable acoustic cardiography (ACG) device to diagnose SLT as an alternative option. This prospective cohort study consecutively enrolled patients with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who underwent successful TAVR. We collected and analysed clinical data including ACG measurements and imaging results. Discrimination capability analysis (ie, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity) of a composite feature from ACG readings in predicting SLT during follow-up was performed. Based on the severity of SLT, patients were categorised into three groups: Group 1 (no SLT), Group 2 (mild SLT) and Group 3 (moderate-to-severe SLT). 116 patients consented and enrolled in the study. At the 1-month follow-up, MDCT revealed a 25% prevalence of SLT with 11.2% classified as moderate-to-severe. ACG analysis revealed distinctive patterns of early systolic, baseless and high-energy murmurs exclusively in patients in Group 3 but not in group 2. The diagnostic performance of ACG for moderate-to-severe SLT showed a sensitivity of 84.62%, specificity of 91.26% and AUC of 0.920 (95% CI: 0.855 to 0.962, p<0.001). At 6 months, both MDCT and ACG indicated that nine (70%) patients in Group 3 who received anticoagulant therapy achieved complete resolution of SLT. ACG can be considered as an effective tool to assist in the diagnosis of SLT based on deterioration of transvalvular haemodynamics post-TAVR.

1138,"39721453","The role of lncRNA NEAT1 in acute graft-versus-host disease: Regulation of macrophage polarization and inflammatory cytokine secretion via JNK/NLRP3 pathway.","Acute graft-versus-host disease (aGVHD) is a complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The role of macrophages as proficient antigen-presenting cells in aGVHD is a prominent area of investigation in contemporary research. The association between long noncoding RNA nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (lncRNA NEAT1) and the macrophage function is of significant interest. However, the role of lncRNA NEAT1 in aGVHD needs to be further explored. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were collected from patients with or without aGVHD (non-aGVHD) after allo-HSCT. RAW264.7 cells and bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) were transduced with NEAT1 lentiviral vector or transfected with NEAT1 small interfering RNA to change the expression level of lncRNA NEAT1. Finally, an aGVHD mouse model was established to evaluate the role of JNK inhibitor or NLRP3 inhibitor in aGVHD. Compared with non-aGVHD patients, lncRNA NEAT1 was significantly up-regulated in the PBMCs of aGVHD patients. ROC and AUC analysis confirmed that the expression of lncRNA NEAT1 was correlated with the occurrence of aGVHD. The overexpression of lncRNA NEAT1 in RAW264.7 could significantly promote the proliferation, migration, and differentiation into M1 macrophages. Knockdown of lncRNA NEAT1 could significantly decrease the proportion of M1 macrophages, regulate pro-inflammatory cytokines secretion, and affect the JNK/NLRP3 pathway in lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced BMDMs. Correspondingly, JNK and NLRP3 inhibitors reduced LPS-induced pro-inflammatory responses in macrophages. Furthermore, JNK and NLRP3 inhibitors regulated macrophage polarization and improved symptoms in aGVHD mice. The aforementioned data suggest that lncRNA NEAT1 potentially plays a significant role in macrophage polarization and the secretion of inflammatory cytokines through its modulation of the JNK/NLRP3 pathway. Consequently, this study establishes a foundation for the development of novel therapeutic approaches targeting aGVHD.","2025","International immunopharmacology"

Subsequently, six machine learning models were constructed, including random forest, decision tree, gradient boosting decision tree, k-nearest neighbor, support vector machine, and AdaBoost algorithms. Feature importance analysis, partial dependence plot, and shapley additive explanations were integrated to enhance the interpretability of the CVD prediction model. Among all models, the random forest exhibited the best performance, with an accuracy of 90 %, an area under the curve of 0.85, and an F1 score of 0.86. Urine cadmium (Cd), blood lead (Pb), urine thallium (Tl), and urine tungsten (W) were identified as the most significant predictors of CVD, with importance scores of 0.062, 0.057, 0.051, and 0.050, respectively. At the overall level, higher levels of urine Cd, blood Pb, and urine W were associated with an increased risk of CVD, whereas a lower level of urine Tl was linked to a reduced CVD risk. Additionally, the analysis of synergistic effects revealed that Cd was the predominant determinant of CVD risk.

Delayed graft function was defined as decreased blood creatinine < 25% within the first 24 h compared to pre-transplantation, and the patients needed hemodialysis in the first 7 days. The atherogenic index of plasma was calculated based on pre-transplant plasma triglycerides and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. The ratio of delayed graft function in renal transplant recipients from living donors was 13.8% (23/167 patients). Hemodialysis time, the ratio of hepatitis infection, overweight and obese, atherosclerosis, positive PRA, and acute rejection in the DGF (+) group were higher than those of the DGF (-) group, p < 0.05 and < 0.001. In particular, plasma CRP-hs level and AIP also were higher in DGF (+) patients compared to those of DGF (-) ones, p < 0.001. Long hemodialysis time, obesity, high plasma CRP-hs, and high AIP in pre-transplant patients were independent factors related to DGF and had predictive value for DGF after kidney transplantation, in which AIP had good predictive value: AUC = 0.859, p < 0.001.

This study aimed to identify immune-related genes associated with the response to imatinib (IM) therapy in CML. Gene expression profiles from IM-treated CML patients were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus database and categorized into high- and low-score groups based on immune scores calculated using the ESTIMATE algorithm. Subsequent bioinformatics analysis identified 428 differentially expressed immune-related genes in the CML context. Functional enrichment analysis revealed that these genes were involved in immune-related pathways, including T-cell receptor signaling and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Finally, based on five modules in weighted gene co-expression network analysis and the top-ranked degree, 10 hub genes were identified. Receiver operating characteristic analysis in two Gene Expression Omnibus datasets identified IL10RA, SCN9A, and SLC26A11 as potential biomarkers for predicting IM response. We further validated these biomarkers in an independent clinical cohort of 60 CML patients treated with IM. Results from quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) revealed high expression of IL10RA and SLC26A11 in responders, while SCN9A showed low expression. All three genes had an area under the curve greater than 0.75, confirming their potential as predictive biomarkers.

The global A-STESS AUC significantly improved for both in-hospital (0.837, 95% CI = 0.760-0.916, p = 0.002) and 6-month (0.739, 95% CI = 0.688-0.826; p = 0.033) mortality prediction. A-STESS-3 cutoff demonstrated a strong sensitivity-specificity balance for both in-hospital (sensitivity = 0.88, specificity = 0.68, accuracy = 0.70) and 6-month (sensitivity = 0.67, specificity = 0.73, accuracy = 0.72) mortality. Hypoalbuminemia is an easily measurable biomarker reflecting the overall patient's condition and is independently related to short- and long-term SE mortality. Integrating hypoalbuminemia into the STESS (A-STESS) significantly enhances mortality prediction. Future studies are needed to externally validate the A-STESS and evaluate the benefits of albumin supplementation in SE patient prognosis.","2025","European journal of neurology"

However, this method is both cumbersome and subjective. Therefore, a microbroth assay was developed to assess host range and lytic activity patterns of phages in the agar overlay method against a collection of carbapenemase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) isolates. The host range of 11 K. pneumoniae-specific phages against 8 non-repetitive well-characterized CRKP isolates was assessed with the agar overlay method and a microbroth assay by monitoring optical density (OD) at 630 nm for 24 h at different phage concentrations (5 × 109-5 × 103 PFU/ml) and two bacterial inocula (5 × 106 and 5 × 108 CFU/ml). The lytic activity of phage-bacteria pairs with transparent/semi-transparent (N = 7), turbid (N = 6), and no (N = 6) lysis in overlay agar method was compared statistically with the growth inhibition at 6 and 24 h in the microbroth assay with analysis of variance (ANOVA), receiver operating characteristic curves (ROC) curves and Fisher's exact test. Optimal cutoffs were determined, and sensitivity and specificity were calculated. Statistically significant differences of growth inhibition at 6 and 24 h for phage concentrations ≥ 5 × 108 PFU/ml for both inocula were found between phages with transparent/semi-transparent, turbid, and no lysis. ROC curve analysis indicated an optimal growth inhibition cutoff of ≥ 31% at high phage and bacteria concentrations for detecting phages with lysis and ≥ 61% at high-phage and low-bacteria concentrations for detecting phages with transparent/semi-transparent lysis with sensitivity/specificity 100%/100% and 100%/86%, respectively. The microbroth growth inhibition assay provided fast, reliable, and objective results for K. pneumoniae phage host-range lytic activity differentiating different patterns of lysis in a high-throughput format.","2025","Infectious diseases and therapy"

Bt is a common Gram-positive, rod-shaped bacterium widely distributed in various environments, including soil and water. It is widely recognized as a source of effective and safe agricultural biopesticides for pest management in various climatic regions globally. In the present work, ensemble species distribution models were developed for Bt based on the generalized linear model (GLM), generalized boosting model (GBM), random forest (RF), and maximum entropy (MaxEnt) under two distinct scenarios, SSP2-4.5 (optimistic) and SSP5-8.5 (pessimistic) for the year of 2050, 2070, and 2090. The performance of our models was evaluated based on true skill statistics (TSS) and the area under the receiver-operator curve (AUC) indices. Both AUC and TSS values were observed in an acceptable range, with AUC at 0.84 and TSS at 0.512, respectively. Results indicate that most of the areas currently suitable for Bt will likely remain stable in the future, particularly Central America, Central and South Africa, South Asia, and parts of Oceania. Norway, Peru, and the UK will have notable habitat gains by 2090 based on SSP2-4.5 and SSP5-8.5 scenarios. On the contrary, Serbia, Guinea, Poland, Croatia, Spain and Romania showed notable losses under both scenarios. Our results underscore Bt potential to improve pest control, crop yields, and environmental sustainability, especially in regions where agriculture is predominant. Our research highlights the need to understand ecological dynamics for future conservation and agricultural planning in the face of climate change.","2025","The Science of the total environment"

Recently, we validated an open-source digital image analysis (DIA) to quantify somatostatin receptor subtype 2 (SSTR2) expression. We aimed to validate the DIA also on somatostatin receptor subtype 5 (SSTR5) in a new cohort of growth hormone (GH)-secreting pituitary tumors, with IHC performed in a different laboratory, and to correlate fg-SRL response with SSTs expression. Somatostatin receptor subtype 2 and SSTR5 were assessed in 42 GH-secreting pituitary tumors, using a semiquantitative immunoreactivity score (IRS) and the DIA by use of the open-access software CellProfiler. The DIA calculates the staining intensity and the percentage of positive cells (%PC). We found a good correlation between IRS and DIA for both SSTR2 and SSTR5 (P < .001), demonstrating the reliability of the DIA in this setting. Response to fg-SRL treatment correlated with SSTR2, but not SSTR5, expression. Somatostatin receptor subtype 2 expression predicted response to fg-SRL. In particular, the identified cut-offs were IRS ≥ 5 (area under the curve [AUC] 0.763; sensitivity 77%; specificity 83%); intensity/area ≥0.106 (AUC 0.833; sensitivity 92%; specificity 83%); and %PC-DIA ≥63.7% (AUC 0.917; sensitivity 92%; specificity 83%).

Data for 294 patients were retrieved and divided into training and validation cohorts (206 and 88 patients, respectively). Univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were used to evaluate prognostic factors to establish a nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves and decision curves were drawn to determine the predictive ability of our model. Preoperative parathyroid hormone (PTH), fasting blood glucose (Glu0h), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), creatinine, and 25(OH) vitamin D (25(OH)D) were identified as essential factors in SHPT, and their combination in the multivariate regression had good performance. Based on the multivariate model, we established a nomogram with a low degree of overfitting, as validated in the training (area under the curve: 0.743) and validation (area under the curve: 0.726) cohorts, which showed good discrimination. The calibration and decision curves also indicated that with a definite threshold, using the nomogram to predict SHPT was more beneficial.

Patients with CD or UC (n = 20) received single doses of probe substrates for CYP1A2 (caffeine 100 mg), CYP2C9 (warfarin 10 mg), CYP2C19 (omeprazole 20 mg), CYP2D6 (metoprolol 50 mg), and CYP3A (midazolam 2 mg) before and after intravenous infusions of risankizumab 1800 mg once every 4 weeks for four doses. Serial blood samples were collected for determination of concentrations of the CYP probe drugs and metabolites with and without risankizumab. Trough samples for risankizumab were collected at sparse timepoints. The point estimates and 90% confidence intervals for maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and the area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to infinity (AUCinf) ratios for the CYP probe substrates administered with risankizumab versus without risankizumab were mostly within the 0.8-1.25 equivalence bounds, except for omeprazole and caffeine. While the upper 90% CI for caffeine AUCinf exceeded 1.25, the point estimate was a modest 1.13 and the Cmax ratio was well within 0.8-1.25. For omeprazole, while the lower bound of the 90% CI for AUCt (0.715) and AUCinf (0.624) extended slightly below the default equivalence limit, the exposures of its metabolite, 5-hydroxy-omeprazole, formed via CYP2C19, were comparable before and after risankizumab treatment, indicating a limited impact of risankizumab.

Our analysis focused on 15,906 and 6,690 beehives in California state, United States, and Quebec province, Canada for 2023, respectively. The accuracy of the RSF model was assessed through three accuracy metrics, namely concordance index (C-index), integrated Brier score (IBS), and time-dependent area under the curve (AUC). Besides, the variables' importance was assessed in both California and Quebec under two criteria configurations, incorporating beehive management criteria and excluding such criteria. Including beehive-management criteria improved accuracy: for the test dataset in California, C-index of 0.8845, IBS of 0.0177, and time-dependent AUC of 0.8819; in Quebec, C-index of 0.9618, IBS of 0.0121, and time-dependent AUC of 0.9687. Comparing feature importance across the regions revealed differences, with sugar-feeding frequency, precipitation, and Miticide-treatment frequency exerting more influence in California and DEM, precipitation, and sugar-feeding frequency playing more substantial roles in Quebec. Beekeeping suitability maps for both regions were provided, classifying land suitability for beekeeping into five categories from very low to very high. By aggregating the areas classified as highly and very highly suitable for beekeeping, the beekeeping suitability maps indicated that 64.712% of California and 66.423% of Quebec exhibit suitable conditions for beekeeping. This study could contribute to reducing honeybee colony losses and supporting the advancement of sustainable agriculture in California and Quebec through 1) pinpointing essential environmental, ecological, and meteorological factors, alongside beehive management practices affecting beehive mortality, and 2) providing maps illustrating land suitability for beekeeping.","2025","Journal of environmental management"

Therefore, this study was aimed to develop a model that leverages plasma methylation biomarkers and clinical characteristics to distinguish between malignant and benign PNs. In a training cohort of 210 patients with PNs, we evaluated plasma circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for the presence of three lung cancer-specific methylation markers: SHOX2, SCT, and HOXA7. Subsequently, we constructed a combined model utilizing methylated SHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 (mSHOX2/SCT/HOXA7) ctDNA levels, the largest nodule size measured by LDCT, and age, employing the binary logistic regression algorithm. Furthermore, we compared the diagnostic performances of the combined model with the Mayo Clinic model and the single mSHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 model by analyzing the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each. The combined model demonstrated an impressive AUC of 0.87 and an accuracy of 0.75 in the training cohort, using pathologic diagnoses as the gold standard. This performance was significantly superior to that of the single mSHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 panel (AUC = 0.81, P < 0.0001) and the Mayo model (AUC = 0.65, P = 0.0005). Further validation in a cohort of 82 patients with PNs confirmed the diagnostic value of the combined model. Additionally, we observed that as the size of the nodule increased, the diagnostic accuracy of the combined model also improved. A combined model incorporating the ctDNA-based methylation status of SHOX2/SCT/HOXA7 genes, the largest nodule size measured by LDCT, and age can serve as a supplementary approach to LDCT for lung cancer. This model enhances the precision in identifying high-risk individuals and optimizes the clinical management strategies for PNs detected by CT.","2025","Lung cancer (Amsterdam, Netherlands)"

However, identifying an individual carrying a specific disease from people with a multi-disease background is challenging. To address this, we developed a Raman spectral implicit feature augmentation with a Raman Intersection, Union, and Subtraction augmentation strategy (RIUS). RIUS expands the data set without requiring additional labeled data by leveraging set operations at the feature level, significantly enhancing model performance across various applications. On a challenging 30-class bacterial classification task, RIUS demonstrated a substantial improvement, increasing the accuracy of ResNet by 2.1% and that of SE-ResNet by 1.4%, achieving accuracies of 85.7% and 87.1%, respectively, on the Bacteria-ID-4 Data set, where RIUS improved ResNet and SE-ResNet accuracies by 13.6% and 14.5%, respectively, with only ten samples per category. When the sample size was reduced, accuracy gains increased to 31.7% and 38.3%, demonstrating the method's robustness across different sample volumes. Compared to basic augmentation, our method exhibited superior performance across various sample volumes and demonstrated exceptional adaptability to different levels of complexity. RIUS exhibited superior performance, particularly in complex settings. Moreover, cluster analysis validated the effectiveness of the implicit feature augmentation module and the consistency between theoretical design and experimental results. We further validated our approach using clinical serum samples from 70 breast cancer patients and 70 controls, achieving an AUC of 0.94 and a sensitivity of 92.9%.

Afterwards, GSE5406 was utilized as the validation set, including 16 without heart failure, 86 with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM), and 108 individuals with ischemic cardiomyopathy (ICM). We conducted a comparative analysis of the variations in TIIRGs gene expression across various forms of heart failure. There were eight genes that showed substantial changes between patients with EFrHF and those without heart failure. A risk model for EFrHF was developed utilizing JAK1 and EIF2AK2, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.909. Five genes exhibited notable disparities between IDCM and ICM. Through multivariate analysis, it was shown that JAK1 and IFNA16/IFNA14 were identified as independent risk variables for distinguishing between the two pathogenic categories. The model, utilizing JAK1 and IFNA16/IFNA14, successfully differentiated between IDCM and ICM with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.722. In the validation set GSE5406, the expression of JAK1 was dramatically downregulated, while EIF2AK2 was significantly upregulated in heart failure (HF) tissues.

Among them, 48 patients were diagnosed with histopathologically confirmed liver fibrosis. A total of 107 radiomic features per patient were extracted from MRI imaging. The dataset was then divided into training and test sets for model development and validation. Stepwise feature reduction was employed to identify the most relevant features and subsequently used to train a gradient-boosted tree model. The gradient-boosted tree model, trained on the training cohort with identified radiomic features to differentiate fibrosis grades, exhibited good performances, achieving AUC values from 0.997 to 0.998. In the independent test cohort of 24 patients, the radiomics model demonstrated AUC values ranging from 0.617 to 0.830, with the highest AUC of 0.830 (95% CI 0.520-0.830) for classifying fibrosis grade 2. Incorporating ADC values did not improve the model's performance. In conclusion, our study emphasizes the significant promise of using radiomics analysis on MRI images for noninvasively staging liver fibrosis.

It is imperative to anticipate the effects of these events on the habitat suitability and resilience of coastal salt marsh vegetation to inform restoration efforts and management strategies. Herein, an ensemble model was developed to evaluate the recovery of Suaeda Salsa in the two subsequent years following the anomalously high temperatures and decreased precipitation experienced during the summer of 2018, potentially leading to a decline in this species in the eastern coast of Liaohe Estuary wetland (Bohai Sea, China). Additionally, the resilience of the ecosystem was evaluated based on the evolution of density and morphology metrics of S. salsa. The findings suggest that the ensemble model demonstrates exceptional predictive performance in assessing habitat suitability, as evidenced by True Skill Statistic (TSS) values of 0.94 ± 0.02 and 0.96 ± 0.03 for the years 2019 and 2020, respectively, and Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) values of 0.96 ± 0.03 in 2019 and 0.97 ± 0.02 in 2020. Tidal elevation and soil salinity were identified as the primary predictors for the habitat suitability of S. salsa, while sand content emerged as the most influential factor driving its expansion. The core and suitable habitat areas of S. salsa experienced a significant increase from 9.61 ± 1.16 km2 in 2019 to 15.66 ± 2.24 km2 in 2020, representing a 62.96 ± 8.44 % growth. A notable increase in density and above-ground biomass was noted, indicating a potential recovery of salt marsh vegetation from multi-stresses. However, a decline in below-ground biomass, from 61.9 g m-2 in August 2018 to 39.8 g m-2 in August 2020, suggests a reduction in the resilience of S. salsa to future disturbances. This decrease in below-ground reserves, which were crucial for the tolerance of S. Salsa, may impact the vegetation's ability to withstand future challenges. The results highlight the effectiveness of optimizing freshwater irrigation and implementing artificially constructed tidal channels as strategies for future restoration efforts.

This follow-up study aims to explore if AAR can also predict short- and long-term SNM outcomes at less than and more than 5 y, respectively. Outcome data were reviewed from a prospectively managed database. Successful treatment was defined as >50% improvement in patient reported fecal incontinence or urgency episodes, or in a symptom severity score. Twenty-six female patients (median: 53 y [range 31-80]) who received a permanent SNM implant were analyzed. In the short-term, no differences were observed in baseline AAR and symptom severity parameters between patients reporting success or failure. At long-term follow-up (median: 122 mo [113-138]) data was available from 17 (17/26, 65%) patients with 7 (7/17, 41%) reporting continued treatment success.

Qualitative assessment of chest CT by radiologists is standard clinical practice and reliable quantification of disease from CT would support ongoing efforts to identify sarcoidosis phenotypes. Standard imaging feature engineering techniques such as radiomics suffer from extreme sensitivity to image acquisition and processing, potentially impeding generalizability of research to clinical populations. In this work, we instead investigate approaches to engineering variogram-based features with the intent to identify a robust, generalizable pipeline for image quantification in the study of sarcoidosis.Approach. For a cohort of more than 300 individuals with sarcoidosis, we investigated 24 feature engineering pipelines differing by decisions for image registration to a template lung, empirical and model variogram estimation methods, and feature harmonization for CT scanner model, and subsequently 48 sets of phenotypes produced through unsupervised clustering. We then assessed sensitivity of engineered features, phenotypes produced through unsupervised clustering, and sarcoidosis disease signal strength to pipeline.Main results. We found that variogram features had low to mild association with scanner model and associations were reduced by image registration. For each feature type, features were also typically robust to all pipeline decisions except image registration. Strength of disease signal as measured by association with pulmonary function testing and some radiologist visual assessments was strong (optimistic AUC ≈ 0.9,p≪0.0001in models for architectural distortion, conglomerate mass, fibrotic abnormality, and traction bronchiectasis) and fairly consistent across engineering approaches regardless of registration and harmonization for CT scanner.Significance.

LSDs are characterized by impaired lysosomal activity caused by mutations in key proteins and enzymes. While lysosomal dysfunction is also linked to AD pathogenesis, its precise role in disease onset or progression remains unclear. Lysosomal ionic homeostasis is recognized as a key feature of many LSDs, but it has not been clinically linked with AD pathology. Thus, investigating whether this regulation is disrupted in AD is important, as it could lead to new therapeutic targets and biomarkers for this multifactorial disease. Here, using two-ion mapping (2-IM) technology, we quantitatively profiled lysosomal pH and Ca2+ in blood-derived monocytes from AD patients and age-matched controls and correlated lysosome ionicity with age and key markers of AD pathology, namely, amyloid deposits, tauopathy, neurodegeneration, and inflammation. Together, the data show that the ionic milieu of lysosomes is dysregulated in monocytes of AD patients and correlates with key plasma biomarkers of AD. Using a machine learning model based on the above parameters, we describe a proof-of-concept combinatorial biomarker platform that accurately distinguishes between patients with AD and control participants with an area under the curve of >96%. Our study introduces a convenient, noninvasive platform with the potential to diagnose Alzheimer's disease based on fluid, cellular, and molecular biomarkers.

Eye shape was classified into spheroidal, ellipsoidal, temporally distorted, nasally distorted, conical, and barrel-shape identified from three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging. Spheroidal and ellipsoidal shapes were defined as nondeformity; others were defined as eye deformity. Myopic maculopathy progression was determined through color fundus photography. Within a 4-year follow-up, 17.1% (7/41) of patients with nondeformed eye shape had MM progression, whereas 69.2% (18/26) of patients with eye shape deformity had MM progression. In multivariable analysis, eye shape deformity (odds ratio, 4.35; 95% confidence interval, 1.10-17.29; P = 0.036) and axial length of ≥28 mm (odds ratio, 12.75; 95% confidence interval, 2.27-71.48; P = 0.004) significantly correlated with MM progression. The predictive discrimination of eye shape alone for MM progression did not differ from axial length (area under the curve: 0.765 vs. 0.750, P = 0.486). By incorporating age, sex, axial length, and eye shape, the prediction model achieved an area under the curve of 0.862 for discriminating MM progression.

The developed SNEDS were characterized using dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy. Thereafter, the loading capacity, in vitro release, thermodynamic, and gastrointestinal stability of the developed formulation were evaluated. The safety and oral bioavailability of VESylated-FMN-SNEDS were assessed in Sprague-Dawley rats, whereas insulin-sensitizing potency was assessed in high-fat diet-induced type 2 diabetic mice. The VESylated-FMN-SNEDS quickly emulsified on dilution (droplet size ∼79.17 nm) and showed remarkable thermodynamic and gastrointestinal stability. The developed formulation demonstrated enhanced oral bioavailability (∼1.3-fold higher AUC0-t) of VESylated-FMN without liver and kidney injury. Consequently, VESylated-FMN-SNEDS significantly improves insulin sensitivity and glycemic control in HFD-fed mice compared to VESylated-FMN by upregulating the transcript level of insulin-sensitizing genes. Therefore, the SNEDS formulation could be an effective strategy to augment the oral bioavailability and insulin-sensitizing potency of VESylated-FMN.","2025","Molecular pharmaceutics"

Pre-interventional variables assessed were International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS), prostate volume (PV), maximum urinary flow rate, prostate-specific antigen, postvoid residual urine volume, and age. The primary outcome was poor urinary function after LDR-BT, defined as an IPSS-Quality of Life score >3 (""mostly dissatisfied"" or worse) at 3 yr or the occurrence of TURP during follow-up. Associations were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was also performed. Poor urinary function outcomes were observed in 46 patients (5.0%). Significant predictors included pre-interventional IPSS (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] per point 1.18; p < 0.001) and PV (aOR per ml, 1.04; p = 0.004). Limitations of the study include potential selection bias and the absence of external validation. Pre-interventional IPSS and PV were significant predictors of poor urinary function after LDR-BT for prostate cancer. A risk calculator based on these parameters was developed to assist individualized treatment planning. Further studies are needed to validate these findings before they can be applied in routine clinical practice. We created a tool to predict the likelihood of urinary problems after a type of radiotherapy called brachytherapy for prostate cancer. The size of the prostate and urinary symptoms before treatment were associated with poor urinary function after treatment. This tool could help doctors and patients in making informed decisions about treatment for prostate cancer.","2025","European urology open science"

A retrospective analysis of the Guangzhou Lung-Care programme was conducted, retrieving average transverse diameter, location, histopathology, frequency and follow-up intervals. Diagnostic performances for 'lung cancers' were evaluated using areas under the curve (AUCs), decision curve analysis (DCA), sensitivities and specificities, with thresholds ranging from 5 mm to 10 mm. We divide malignant pGGNs into three groups: (1) minimally invasive adenocarcinoma (MIA) and invasive adenocarcinoma (IA), (2) atypical adenomatous hyperplasia (AAH) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) and MIA and IA and (3) IA-only. In 'MIA+IA', increasing the threshold from 5 mm to 8 mm improved specificity (60.97% to 88.85%, p<0.001) and positive predictive values (PPVs; 5.87% to 14.88%, p<0.001), but decreased sensitivity (94.44% to 75.56%, p<0.001). Further raising threshold from 8 mm reduced sensitivity (75.56% to 60.00%, p<0.001), while slightly increasing specificity (88.85% to 93.47%, p<0.001) and PPVs (14.88% to 19.15%, p<0.001). Increasing threshold from 5 mm to 7 mm enhanced the AUC for 'MIA+IA' (from 0.711 to 0.829), 'AAH+AIS+MIA+IA' (from 0.748 to 0.804) and 'IA-only' (from 0.783 to 0.833). At 8 mm, the AUCs for these categories were similar. However, increasing the threshold from 7 mm to 10 mm resulted in reduced AUCs for 'MIA+IA' (0.829 to 0.767), 'AAH+AIS+MIA+IA' (0.804 to 0.744) and 'IA-only' (0.833 to 0.800). DCA reveals that the 8 mm predictive model demonstrates greater clinical utility compared with models with other thresholds. Increasing the diameter threshold for positive results for pGGNs, up to 8 mm could enhance diagnostic performance. NCT04938804.","2025","Thorax"

Hypoxia and immune escape are critical factors that contribute to the progression of and resistance to therapy in patients with TNBC. Nevertheless, few studies have comprehensively analyzed hypoxia and immune escape in patients with TNBC. This study aimed to examine the expression of hypoxia- and immune escape-related genes in TNBC and their influence on prognosis. TNBC datasets were downloaded and processed from The Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus. Differential expression analysis identified 4949 differentially expressed genes, between TNBC and normal tissues. The intersection yielded 116 hypoxia- and immune escape-related differentially expressed genes (H&IERDEGs), including KIF4A, BIRC5, and BUB1. Enrichment analyses indicated that H&IERDEGs were significantly enriched in biological processes, including cell chemotaxis, leukocyte migration, and cytokine-cytokine receptor interaction. Subsequently, weighted gene co-expression network analysis identified 43 module genes that were found to define two TNBC subtypes. We constructed a prognostic risk model consisting of eight signature genes, which demonstrated a high predictive performance to predict the overall survival (OS) of patients with TNBC with an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 0.9 at 1 year survival. This indicates that the model effectively differentiates between outcomes, reflecting its robust performance. This study investigated the roles and potential mechanisms of hypoxia- and immune escape-related genes in TNBC and constructed a prognostic risk model with a high predictive performance.

Currently, there is a paucity of established biomarkers capable of evaluating SLE flares. This study aimed to identify novel biomarkers that exhibit improved diagnostic accuracy in assessing SLE activity. A cross-sectional study was conducted at Zhongshan Hospital Xiamen University from August 2021 to April 2024,enrolling 118 patients with SLE, including 81 cases of active SLE, 50 cases of active lupus nephritis (LN) and 30 cases of active non-LN. The objective was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of novel biomarker called Neutrophil Extracellular Traps(NETs) for SLE activity and analyze its correlations with conventional biomarkers such as complement C3, C4, and anti-dsDNA. Serum NETs levels were significantly elevated in patients with active SLE and active LN(P < 0.001). Furthermore, positive correlations were observed between NETs levels and disease activity score based on Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Disease Activity Index-2 K (SLEDAI-2 K) (r = 0.64, P < 0.001), as well as anti-dsDNA antibody (r = 0.54, P < 0.001).Conversely, the NETs levels were negativity correlated with complement C3 concentration (r = -0.50, P < 0.001), as well as C4 concentration (r = -0.34,P < 0.001). Univariate and multivariate analysis revealed two biomarkers performed statistical significance: NETs (OR = 6.802, 95 %CI: 2.414-19.167,P < 0.001) and anti-dsDN A(OR = 3.95,95 %CI:1.582-9.864, P = 0.003).

However, there is still a lack of practice in combining fatty tissue to discriminate benign and malignant pulmonary nodules. This study proposes a deep learning (DL) approach to explore the potential predictive value of dual imaging markers, including intrathoracic fat (ITF), in patients with pulmonary nodules. We enrolled 1321 patients with pulmonary nodules from three centers. Image feature extraction was performed on computed tomography (CT) images of pulmonary nodules and ITF by DL, multimodal information was used to discriminate benign and malignant in patients with pulmonary nodules. Here, the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of the model for ITF combined with pulmonary nodules were 0.910(95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.870-0.950, P = 0.016), 0.922(95 % CI: 0.883-0.960, P = 0.037) and 0.899(95 % CI: 0.849-0.949, P = 0.033) in the internal test cohort, external test cohort1 and external test cohort2, respectively, which were significantly better than the model for pulmonary nodules. Intrathoracic fat index (ITFI) emerged as an independent influencing factor for benign and malignant in patients with pulmonary nodules, correlating with a 9.4 % decrease in the risk of malignancy for each additional unit. This study demonstrates the potential auxiliary predictive value of ITF as a noninvasive imaging biomarker in assessing pulmonary nodules.","2025","Physica medica : PM : an international journal devoted to the applications of physics to medicine and biology : official journal of the Italian Association of Biomedical Physics (AIFB)"

Timely diagnosis and early identification of severe cases are crucial to improving patient outcomes and overall survival rates. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy of two transcripts, IFI44L and PI3, in the early differentiation between SFTS virus (SFTSV) infection and bacterial sepsis, as well as in the prompt identification of severe cases during epidemic seasons. In a prospective study conducted between 1 May 2021 and 30 September 2022, we enrolled 225 patients who presented with acute fever and thrombocytopenia at four hospitals in Shandong Province, China. The two-transcript signature provided a clear distinction between SFTS and bacterial infection, achieving an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.961 (95% confidence interval [95% CI] 0.916-0.986), outperforming C-reactive protein (0.810 [95% CI 0.738-0.870]) and procalcitonin (0.764 [95% CI 0.687-0.830]). Importantly, the relative expression of the IFI44L gene was significantly elevated in fatal SFTS cases, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.820 (95% CI 0.727-0.914), indicating its potential as an early prognostic marker. Additionally, IFI44L and PI3 were identified as potential biomarkers for distinguishing SFTS patients with and without invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, with AUC values of 0.817 and 0.753, respectively.

Traditional experimental approaches for investigating circRNA-miRNA interactions (CMI) are both time-consuming and costly, making computational methods a valuable alternative. Hence, we propose a computational model for predicting CMI, leveraging a hybrid multimodal network and higher-order neighborhood information (Hither-CMI). Specifically, Hither-CMI employs Multiple Kernel Learning (MKL) to integrate sequence, structure, and expression similarity networks of circRNA and miRNA, resulting in a hybrid multimodal network. Next, an enhanced Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) is utilized to combine the circRNA-miRNA hybrid multimodal network with the CMI association network, producing a hybrid higher-order embedding representation. Finally, the XGBoost classifier is applied for training and prediction. The Hither-CMI model achieved a predicted AUC value of 0.9134. In case studies, 25 out of the top 30 predicted CMI were confirmed by recent literature. These extensive experimental results further validate the effectiveness of Hither-CMI in predicting potential CMI, making it a promising prescreening tool for further biological research.","2025","Journal of chemical information and modeling"

We investigated the use of standardized two-dimensional grayscale ultrasound and Doppler imaging markers in differentiating between these closely related, yet distinct, conditions. This was a retrospective cohort study conducted in two centers with specialized PAS services. All consecutive women with at least one previous Cesarean delivery and a current pregnancy with a low-lying placenta or placenta previa, for whom detailed prenatal ultrasound, management and outcome information was available for review by the research team, were included. PAS was diagnosed clinically by the abnormal adherence of the placenta to the uterus. The PAS cases were classified using the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics clinical classification. Grade 1 was considered low-grade PAS while Grades 2 and 3 were classified as high-grade PAS. The ultrasound markers were categorized according to their underlying pathophysiology, including lower uterine segment (LUS) remodeling, uteroplacental vascular remodeling and serosal hypervascularity. The combined ultrasound features were analyzed among the PAS and non-PAS subgroups using the chi-square test or Fisher's exact test, and univariable and multivariable logistic regression analysis. Additionally, receiver-operating-characteristics (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the combined ultrasound features in differentiating between high-grade PAS and uterine-scar dehiscence. Out of the 150 cases retrieved, six cases were excluded for not meeting the eligibility criteria. The included 144 cases comprised 89 cases of PAS, 23 cases of uterine-scar dehiscence and 32 cases of uncomplicated low-lying placenta or placenta previa. Among the PAS cases, there were 16 cases of low-grade PAS and 73 of high-grade PAS. Combined signs of LUS remodeling were present in most cases of uterine-scar dehiscence (20/23 (87.0%)) and high-grade PAS (67/73 (91.8%)) (P = 0.444), while these signs were absent in cases of low-grade PAS (0/16) and uncomplicated low-lying placenta or placenta previa (0/32). A subgroup analysis of cases with all LUS remodeling features present revealed that the combined signs of serosal hypervascularity (adjusted odds ratio (aOR), 41.2 (95% CI, 7.5-225.3)) and uteroplacental vascular remodeling (aOR, 116.0 (95% CI, 15.3-878.3)) were significantly associated with high-grade PAS. Diagnostic accuracy testing within this subgroup revealed an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.90 (95% CI, 0.81-0.99), sensitivity of 89.6% (95% CI, 79.7-95.7%) and specificity of 90.0% (95% CI, 68.3-98.8%) for the diagnosis of high-grade PAS when all signs of uteroplacental vascular remodeling were present. If both signs of serosal hypervascularity were present, the AUC was 0.84 (95% CI, 0.74-0.95) with a sensitivity of 83.6% (95% CI, 72.5-91.5%) and specificity of 85.0% (95% CI, 62.1-96.8%) for the diagnosis of high-grade PAS. The combined ultrasound markers of LUS remodeling are common in both high-grade PAS and uterine-scar dehiscence, while the combined features of abnormal vascularity (uteroplacental vascular remodeling and serosal hypervascularity) are specific to high-grade PAS.

Elevated hepatic acetate concentrations, often attributed to high caloric intake, are recognized as a pivotal factor in the etiology of obesity and metabolic syndrome. Therefore, the assessment of acetate breakdown and TCA cycle activity plays a central role in understanding the impact of diet-induced alterations on liver metabolism. Magnetic resonance-based deuterium metabolic imaging (DMI) could help to unravel the underlying mechanisms involved in disease development and progression, however, the application of conventional deuterated glucose does not lead to substantial enrichment in hepatic glutamine and glutamate. This study aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of DMI for tracking deuterated acetate breakdown via the TCA cycle in lean and diet-induced fatty liver (FL) rats using 3D DMI after an intraperitoneal infusion of sodium acetate-d3 at 9.4T. Localized and nonlocalized liver spectra acquired at 10 time points post-injection over a 130-min study revealed similar intrahepatic acetate uptake in both animal groups (AUCFL = 717.9 ± 131.1 mM▯min-1, AUClean = 605.1 ± 119.9 mM▯min-1, p = 0.62).

One approach to providing information on the location and biological composition of these ecosystems, especially in difficult-to-reach environments such as the deep sea, is to generate spatial predictions for VME indicator taxa. In this study, the Random Forest algorithm was used to model the spatial distribution of density for 14 deep-water VME indicator taxa under current environmental conditions and future climate change scenarios (SSP2-4.5 and SSP3-7.0) within the New Zealand Territorial Sea and Exclusive Economic Zone (100-1500 m water depth) to evaluate potential changes in the location and distribution of density of these taxa over time. Overall, our species distribution models performed well for all taxa (mean AUC = 0.82; TSS = 0.56; r = 0.40) and predicted a considerable average reduction in density (54%) and habitat extent (61%), by the end of the 21st century under both climate change scenarios. Nevertheless, models identified regions that might serve as internal refugia (approximately 158,000 km2), where some taxa are predicted to maintain the high densities predicted for current-day environmental conditions under future climatic conditions, and external refugia (approximately 121,000 km2) where taxa were predicted to expand into new locations by the end of the 21st century. Our results represent a significant step forward as they provide predictions of the distribution of taxa densities, rather than just occurrence, under both present and future climatic conditions. Furthermore, these findings carry implications for ecosystem management and spatial planning, suggesting current marine spatial protection measures may not offer adequate protection to VME indicator taxa in the face of climate change. Additionally, activities like bottom trawling, present or future, may jeopardize climate refugia viability. Thus, a comprehensive assessment of cumulative effects on VME indicator taxa is recommended to establish effective protection measures for potential climate refugia, ensuring the continuity of essential ecosystem services.","2025","Journal of environmental management"

In Sweden, CRC screening programmes have varied regionally since the mid-2000s, but the significance of organised screening for counteracting complex inequities in screening attendance has not been investigated. This study aimed to assess patterns of inequities in lifetime CRC screening attendance in the Swedish population aged 60-69 years by identifying intersectional strata at higher risk of never attending CRC screening. The research question is answered using decision trees to reduce the complexity of a full intersectional matrix into a reduced intersectional matrix for risk estimation. Participants were drawn from the cross-sectional 2019 European Health Interview Survey (N = 9,757, response rate: 32.52%). The Conditional Inference Tree (CIT) (AUC = 0.7489, F-score = 0.7912, depth = 4, significance level = 0.05) identified region of residence (opportunistic vs organised screening), country of origin, gender, age and income as relevant variables in explaining lifetime CRC screening attendance in Sweden. Then, Poisson regression with robust standard errors estimated that EU-born women living in opportunistic screening regions belonging to the 2nd income quintile had the highest risk of never attending CRC screening (PR = 8.54, p < 0.001), followed by EU-born men living in opportunistic screening regions (PR = 7.41, p < 0.001) compared to the reference category (i.e. people aged 65-69 living in organised screening regions). In contrast, only age-related differences in attendance were found in regions with organised screening (i.e. people aged 60-64 living in regions with organised screening (PR = 2.01, p < 0.05)). The AUC of the reduced intersectional matrix model (0.7489) was higher than the full intersectional matrix model (0.6959) and slightly higher than the main effects model (0.7483), demonstrating intersectional effects of the reduced intersectional matrix compared with the main effects model and better discriminatory accuracy than the full intersectional matrix. In conclusion, regions with long-established organised CRC screening programmes display more limited socio-demographic inequities than regions with opportunistic CRC screening. This suggests that organised screening may be a crucial policy instrument to improve equity in CRC screening, which, in the long run, has the potential to prevent inequities in colorectal cancer mortality. Moreover, decision trees appear to be valuable statistical tools for efficient data-driven simplification of the analytical and empirical complexity that epidemiological intersectional analysis conventionally entails.","2025","Social science & medicine (1982)"

The aim of this study is to identify the critical genes that are involved in the pathogenicity of PE by applying integrated bioinformatic methods and to investigate the genes' diagnostic capability. Datasets that investigated PE have been downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) datasets. Differential gene expression, weighted gene co-expression analysis (WGCNA), protein-protein interaction (PPI) network construction, and finally, the calculation of area under the curve and Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were done for the potential hub genes. The results generated from the GSE186257 dataset (discovery cohort) were validated in the GSE75010 dataset (validation cohort). Following validation of the hub-genes, a multilayer regulatory network was constructed to include the up-stream regulatory elements (transcription factors and miRNAs) of the validated hub-genes. WGCNA revealed six modules that were significantly correlated with PE. A total of 231 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified. DEGs were intersected with the WGCNA modules' genes, totalling 55 genes. These shared genes were used to construct the PPI network; subsequently, four genes, namely FLT1, HTRA4, LEP and PAPPA2, were identified as hub-genes for PE in the discovery cohort. The expressional of these four hub genes were validated in the validation cohort and found to be highly expressed. ROC analysis in both datasets revealed that all these genes had a significant PE diagnostic ability. The regulatory network showed that FLT1 gene is the most connected and regulated gene among the validated hub-genes. This integrated analysis revealed that FLT1, LEP, HTRA4 and PAPPA2 may be strongly involved in the pathogenicity of PE and act as promising biomarkers and potential therapeutic targets for PE.","2025","Placenta"

The Eckardt score is used to define clinical outcomes. However, objective metrics are lacking. This study aimed to identify whether any high-resolution manometry (HRM) parameters may be useful in predicting a positive outcome after laparoscopic Heller-Dor (LHD). Patients who underwent LHD between 2012 and 2022 were enrolled. The patients were divided according to the outcome: the success group (SG) and the failure group (FG). In addition to the common HRM parameters, we measured the difference between pre- and postoperative integrated relaxation pressures (∆-IRPs). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was performed to assess the accuracy of each HRM parameter. Of note, 336 patients (92.3%) were classified in the SG, and 28 patients (7.7%) were classified in the FG. No difference was found in terms of manometric types, symptom duration, and history of previous treatments. Preoperative lower esophageal sphincter (LES) pressure and IRP were higher in the SG than in the FG (41 vs 35 mm Hg [P =.03] and 33 vs 26 mm Hg [P =.002], respectively). The postoperative LES metrics were similar between the 2 groups, except for the ∆-IRP that was higher in the SG (23 mm Hg [IQR, 15-31]) than in the FG (14 mm Hg [IQR, 9-17]) (P =.0002). In the univariate analysis, age, LES preoperative pressure, IRP, and ∆-IRP were factors able to predict a positive clinical outcome. In the multivariate analysis, the ∆-IRP was the only parameter independently related to clinical success (odds ratio, 0.94; 5%-95% CI, 0.89-0.99). The ROC curve for the ∆-IRP showed an area under the curve of 0.71, with a threshold value set at 16.5 mm Hg (sensibility of 71% and specificity of 70%). Our data showed that the ∆-IRP with a threshold of 16.5 mm Hg could represent a new objective tool for predicting the long-term positive outcome of LHD in patients with esophageal achalasia.","2025","Journal of gastrointestinal surgery : official journal of the Society for Surgery of the Alimentary Tract"

The research utilized CT imaging data from 585 OC patients, including 142 cases with complete follow-up information and 125 cases with unknown recurrence status. To pre-train the teacher network, 318 unlabeled images were sourced from public datasets (TCGA-OV and PLAGH-202-OC). Multi-view contrastive learning (MVCL) was employed to generate multi-view 2D tumor slices, enhancing the teacher network's ability to extract features from complex, heterogeneous tumors with high intra-class variability. Building on this foundation, the proposed semi-supervised multi-task self-distillation (Semi-MTSD) framework integrated OC subtyping as an auxiliary task using multi-task learning (MTL). This approach allowed the co-training of a student network for recurrence prediction, leveraging both labeled and unlabeled data to improve predictive performance in data-limited settings. The student network's performance was assessed using preoperative CT images with known recurrence outcomes. Evaluation metrics included area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SEN), specificity (SPE), F1 score, floating-point operations (FLOPs), parameter count, training time, inference time, and mean corruption error (mCE). The proposed framework achieved an ACC of 0.862, an AUC of 0.916, a SPE of 0.895, and an F1 score of 0.831, surpassing existing methods for OC recurrence prediction. Comparative and ablation studies validated the model's robustness, particularly in scenarios characterized by data scarcity and tumor heterogeneity. The MVCL and Semi-MTSD framework demonstrates significant advancements in OC recurrence prediction, showcasing strong generalization capabilities in complex, data-constrained environments. This approach offers a promising pathway toward more personalized treatment strategies for OC patients.","2025","Computerized medical imaging and graphics : the official journal of the Computerized Medical Imaging Society"

However, ankle 3D movement proprioception has never been measured in weight-bearing. Accordingly, the active 3-dimensional movement extent discrimination apparatus (AMEDA-3D) was developed and its reliability and validity were investigated. A total of 58 subjects volunteered for this trial, with 12 subjects with chronic ankle instability (CAI) and 12 healthy controls in the test-retest reliability study. There were 17 subjects with CAI and 17 healthy controls in the validity study. An intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Minimum Detectable Change at the 90% confidence interval (MDC90) were computed. AMEDA-3D scores were analysed by independent samples t-tests, and Youden's index was used to calculate the optimal AMEDA-3D cut-off for discriminating individuals with CAI. Pearson's correlation analysis was used to explore the relationship between AMEDA-3D scores and Y Balance Test (YBT), Time In Balance Test (TIB), and Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) scores. The main results were as follows: (1) The ICC(3,1) value of AMEDA-3D scores was 0.817 (95% CI = 0.452-0.945) in CAI subjects. (2) The AMEDA-3D proprioceptive area under the curve score used to discriminate CAI subjects from healthy controls was 0.778, with a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 82%. (3) AMEDA-3D proprioceptive scores were moderately correlated with CAIT scores (r = 0.58 and p < 0.001), YBT (r = 0.47 and p = 0.005), and TIB (r = 0.68 and p < 0.001). Our findings suggest that the AMEDA-3D tool shows good reliability and validity for clinical assessment of proprioceptive deficits associated with CAI. Improved ankle 3D motor proprioception may positively impact subjects' balance control, self-rated symptoms, and function.","2025","European journal of sport science"

Patients with chronic liver disease were prospectively enrolled and underwent iATT, CAP and MRI-derived PDFF measurements for hepatic steatosis evaluation. According to MRI-derived PDFF values, steatosis grades were categorised as steatosis (S)0 (< 5.2%), S1 (≥ 5.2%, < 11.3%), S2 (≥ 11.3%, < 17.1%) and S3 (≥ 17.1%). Correlation coefficients (CCs) were determined, diagnostic performances were compared by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and agreement was evaluated using the calculated percentage error (PE) and expected limit of agreement (LOA). A total of 414 patients (median age 64 years, 203 females) were evaluated. The CC between iATT and MRI-derived PDFF was 0.727 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.678-0.770), which was higher than that between CAP and MRI-derived PDFF at 0.615 (95% CI 0.551-0.672) (p < 0.001).

Maximum efforts are made to reduce bias, yet DBPCFCs are costly, time-, and resource-intensive. Less demanding open food challenges are increasingly used in clinical practice. However, recommendations regarding the use of these challenges are based on low certainty of evidence, and no comparative studies have been performed using the most recent international food challenge guidelines. We hypothesised that the open food challenge is non-inferior to DBPCFC in children suspected of allergy to cashew nuts, hazelnuts or peanuts. A total of 63 children, aged 4 years and older, were included if referred for suspected IgE-mediated allergy to cashew nut, hazelnut, or peanut. All study participants underwent DBPCFC first, followed by an open food challenge for the same food. Challenge outcomes were assessed by predefined criteria into positive, negative, or inconclusive. DBPCFC and open food challenge outcomes were the same for 36/41 (87.8%) patients. Sensitivity and specificity of the open food challenge were 0.91 (95% CI 0.79, 1.03) and 0.83 (95% CI 0.63, 1.01), respectively, with an AUC value of 0.87. Eliciting and stop doses were not significantly different between both food challenges. The Diagnostic accuracy of open food challenge is non-inferior to that of DBPCFC. This finding implies less demanding open food challenges can be implemented for children from the age of 4 years suspected to be cashew nut, hazelnut, or peanut allergic. Further research is necessary to validate our findings and to investigate the diagnostic accuracy for other major food allergens.","2025","Allergy"

There is limited information on persistent esophageal symptoms despite histologic remission (HR). We aimed to assess the prevalence and predictors of persistent esophageal symptoms in adult patients with EoE in HR. We performed a retrospective cohort study of adult EoE patients in HR (<15 eosinophils per high power field [eos/hpf]). Exclusion criteria included: no available data on symptoms, chronic opiate use, disorders of esophagogastric junction outflow on Chicago Classification version 4 diagnosis, esophageal candidiasis, erosive esophagitis, or other known cause of esophageal dysphagia besides EoE. Based on prior literature, definitions include: complete HR (<5 eos/hpf), partial HR (5-14 eos/hpf), and endoscopic fibrostenosis (rings and/or stricture). Esophageal symptoms were assessed within 2 weeks of HR and categorized into the major symptoms of dysphagia, chest pain, and heartburn. Given the retrospective nature of the study, a global symptom response (absence or presence) was used. Demographics, disease history, endoscopy reports, EoE endoscopic reference score, and histology were recorded. Univariate and multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed. Eosinophil thresholds for persistent symptoms were determined using receiver operating characteristics analyses. Of 289 EoE patients in HR, 133 (46%) had esophageal symptoms: dysphagia (N = 119; 41.2%), heartburn (N = 28; 20.8%), and chest pain (N = 10; 7.5%). Significant predictors for persistent dysphagia were anxiety (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 3.77) and endoscopic fibrostenosis (aOR 3.87). Significant predictors for persistent heartburn with or without chest pain were anxiety or depression (aOR 12.2 and aOR 11.0) and partial HR (aOR 1.17 and aOR 1.18). Threshold eosinophil counts for persistent heartburn and chest pain were 2.5 and 3.5 eos/hpf, respectively (AUC 0.71 and 0.69). We report a high prevalence of persistent esophageal symptoms in EoE patients who are in HR. Risk factors include anxiety, depression, endoscopic fibrostenosis, and partial HR. These findings can help direct patient care, including endoscopic dilation and managing psychiatric comorbidities. Targeting less than 2.5 and 3.5 eos/hpf for heartburn and chest pain may be warranted.","2025","Diseases of the esophagus : official journal of the International Society for Diseases of the Esophagus"

The Kasilian watershed is characterized by multiple sub-watersheds, which vary in their environmental conditions and SR potential, with a total of 19 sub-watersheds. The research was carried out in four phases: mapping SR using the IESM, implementing the Fallback bargaining algorithm based on game theory, applying deep learning algorithms (CNN, LSTM, RNN), and performing statistical analysis for optimal model selection. Based on the results, the analysis of geo-environmental criteria indicated that sub-watersheds with poor conditions regarding rain erosivity, soil erodibility, LS, elevation, and land use faced greater challenges in SR. Utilizing the Fallback bargaining algorithm for sub-watershed prioritization revealed that sub-watershed 5 emerged as having the highest SR potential due to high rain erosivity and a significant LS factor. Spatial SR mapping via game theory algorithm demonstrated that northern sub-watersheds in the Kasilian watershed had greater SR potential. Deep learning algorithms were also utilized for SR distribution modeling, where the RNN model was deemed optimal, yielding error statistics of MAE: 0.05, MSE: 0.04, R2: 0.79, RMSE: 0.20, and AUC: 0.97. The SR distribution patterns demonstrated that RNN and LSTM algorithms exhibited similar classification outcomes, differing from those of the CNN algorithm. The prioritization of sub-watersheds using various approaches revealed that the Fallback bargaining algorithm showed a 47% similarity with the InVEST model results. In contrast, deep learning models such as CNN, LSTM, and ARANN exhibited 84%, 79%, and 79% similarity, respectively. These findings supported SR zonation maps, reinforcing that deep learning models outperformed the game theory algorithm. The Alpha Diversity Indices (ADI) confirmed that the outputs from the LSTM and RNN models showed identical changes across all indices. Minimal variations in the other approaches suggested that all five methods yielded similar results based on diversity indices (including Taxa, Dominance, Simpson, and Equitability), indicating no significant differences among them when compared to the InVEST model in sediment modeling.","2025","Environmental science and pollution research international"

Patient data were gathered from a cohort study titled ""Longitudinal Study of Bariatric Surgery in Western China."" The synthetic minority oversampling technique was implemented, with 70% randomly selected as the training set and the remaining 30% as the testing set. Univariate logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with T2DM remission. These were included in subsequent stepwise multivariate analyses. A nomogram was then constructed. It was evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration plot, and decision curve analysis. Finally, eight pre-existing predictive models were validated. Initially, 166 patients were enrolled with a T2DM remission rate of 89.2%. Univariate logistic regression indicated that male patients, T2DM duration exceeding 1 year, elevated fasting blood glucose levels, and higher HbA1c levels were less likely to achieve remission 1 year following SG. A nomogram was constructed using variables, including sex, T2DM duration, and HbA1c levels. The ROC curve indicated that the nomogram had higher accuracy (AUC = 0.826, 95%CI: 0.768-0.884).

However, the roles of kidney transplant recipients (KTRs) with novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) are still unclear. In this research, we investigated the predictive value of peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets on the severity of KTRs with COVID-19 and the correlation between antibodies and lymphocyte levels. 84 patients with kidney transplantation combined with COVID-19 admitted from December 2022 to February 2023 were included. On the basis of the severity of COVID-19, they were categorized into a mild (n = 49) and a severe group (n = 35). The logistic regression method was utilized to build the critical risk prediction model for KTRs complicated with COVID-19. The receiver operator characteristic curve (ROC), calibration plot and clinical decision curve analysis (DCA) were applied to assess the discrimination, calibration and clinical application value of this model. The Spearman correlation test was applied to examine the connection between antibodies and various immune indexes. Except for the increase of CD4+HLA-DR+ T cells, the number of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ T cell subsets in severe was lower than that in mild (P < 0.05). IL-6 in severe was higher than mild (P < 0.05). After screening variables, we established a regression equation prediction model, logit (P) = 4.965+ (-0.038) × (CD3+/lymphocytes (%)) + 0.064× (CD4+HLA-DR+/ CD4+ T cells (%)) + (-0.040) × (CD14+HLA-DR+/monocytes (%)). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of the prediction model was 0.779 (95 % CI 0.679-0.879, P = 0.001). The cut-off value was 0.308, with a prediction sensitivity of 0.829 (95 % CI 0.657-0.928) and a specificity of 0.653 (95 % CI 0.503-0.779). Logistic regression analysis showed the increase in the percentage of CD4+HLA-DR+ T cells among CD4+ T cells was a risk factor for COVID-19 severity among kidney transplant recipients, while the increase in the percentage of CD3+ T cells among lymphocytes and CD14+HLA-DR+ monocytes among CD14+ monocytes acted as protective factors. COVID-19 antibodies were negatively correlated with CD8+CD45RA+CD27- (Terminally Differentiated Effector Memory T Cells, TEMRA), CD8+CD28-, CD8+CD38+ and CD4+CD38+ T cells, while positively correlated with CD8+CD45RA-CD27- (Effector Memory T cells, T8EM), CD8+CD45RA-CD27+ (Central Memory T cells, T8CM) and CD8+CD28+ T cells.

The adoption of the Phoenix sepsis criteria eliminated the Systemic Inflammatory Response Syndrome criteria from the definition of pediatric sepsis. The objective of this study is to derive and validate machine learning models predicting in-hospital mortality for children with suspected or confirmed infection or who met the Phoenix sepsis criteria for sepsis and septic shock. Materials and Methods: Retrospective cohort analysis of 63,824 patients with suspected or confirmed infection admission diagnosis in two pediatric intensive care units (PICUs) in Atlanta, Georgia, from January 1, 2010, through May 10, 2022. The Phoenix Sepsis Score criteria were applied to data collected within 24 h of PICU admission. The primary outcome was in-hospital mortality. The composite secondary outcome was in-hospital mortality or PICU length of stay (LOS) ≥ 72 h. Model-based score performance measures were the area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC). Results: Among 18,389/63,824 (29%) children with suspected infection (median age [25th - 75th interquartile range [IQR]): 3.9 [1.1,10.9]; female, 45%, a total of 5,355 met Phoenix sepsis criteria within 24 h of PICU admission. Of the children with Phoenix sepsis, a total of 514 (9.6%) died in the hospital, and 2,848 (53.2%) died or had a PICU stay of ≥72 h. Children with Phoenix septic shock had an in-hospital mortality of 386 (16.4%) and 1,294 (54.9%) had in-hospital mortality or PICU stay of ≥72 h. For children with Phoenix sepsis and Phoenix septic shock, the multivariable logistic regression, light gradient boosting machine, random forest, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, support vector machine, multilayer perceptron, and decision tree models predicting in-hospital mortality had AUPRCs of 0.48-0.65 (95% CI range: 0.42-0.66), 0.50-0.70 (95% CI range: 0.44-0.70), 0.52-0.70 (95% CI range: 0.47-0.71), 0.50-0.70 (95% CI range: 0.44-0.70), 0.49-0.67 (95% CI range: 0.43-0.68), 0.49-0.66 (95% CI range: 0.45-0.67), and 0.30-0.38 (95% CI range: 0.28-0.40) and AUROCs of 0.82-0.88 (95% CI range: 0.82-0.90), 0.84-0.88 (95% CI range: 0.84-0.90), 0.81-0.88 (95% CI range: 0.81-0.90), 0.84-0.88 (95% CI range: 0.83-0.90), 0.82-0.87 (95% CI range: 0.82-0.90), 0.80-0.86 (95% CI range: 0.79-0.89), and 0.76-0.82 (95% CI range: 0.75-0.85), respectively. Conclusion: Among children with Phoenix sepsis admitted to a PICU, the random forest model had the best AUPRC for in-hospital mortality compared to the light gradient boosting machine, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, logistic regression, multilayer perceptron, support vector machine, and decision tree models or a Phoenix Sepsis Score ≥ 2. These findings suggest that machine learning methods to predict in-hospital mortality in children with suspected infection predict mortality in a PICU setting with more accuracy than application of the Phoenix sepsis criteria.","2025","Shock (Augusta, Ga.)"

Elevated rates of DOA frequently signify substandard welfare conditions and might stem from multiple causes, resulting in diminished productivity and economic losses. This study included 18,643 truckload entries from 45 farms, encompassing a total of 23,191,809 meat-type ducks sent to a single slaughterhouse in Eastern Thailand between January 2019 and December 2023. The objective of this study was twofold: first, to classify high DOA rates (≥ 0.15%) using several predictors, including season, period of the day, number of ducks per truckload, distance, duration of transportation, age, average body weight, lairage time, and temperature at the lairage area. This classification was performed using machine learning (ML) algorithms such as Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), Random Forests (RF), and Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost). Additionally, several data-sampling techniques, including oversampling, undersampling, Random Over-Sampling Examples (ROSE), and Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE), were utilized to address the issue of imbalanced data. Second, to analyze variable importance contributing to the predictive outcomes. The descriptive analysis revealed a mean DOA percentage of 0.14% (range: 0 to 22.46%, SD = 0.49). The results of the high DOA classification indicated that among all models, XGBoost-Up, XGBoost-Down, and RF-Down were the top three models, achieving the highest overall scores in evaluation metrics including Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC), sensitivity, precision, and F1-score. The primary factors contributing to the high predictive performance of the models were the number of ducks per truckload, temperature at the lairage area, and average body weight. Additionally, the duration and distance of transportation, as well as the period of transportation, were secondary factors contributing to the outcome. These factors should be further investigated to minimize losses during the pre-slaughter phase in meat-type ducks.

Levels of aD1 and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin were quantified with the QUANTA Flash and QUANTA Lite systems, respectively, in sera collected at less than 18 weeks of gestation. Adverse pregnancy outcome was defined as delivery at before 34 weeks of gestation for preeclampsia or placental insufficiency or fetal death after 12 weeks of gestation. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis assessed the diagnostic properties of aD1 and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Bivariate comparisons were made between each biomarker. Multivariable regression modeling of adverse pregnancy outcomes was performed, and backward selection determined variables for a final model for adverse pregnancy outcomes. Logistic regression of lupus anticoagulant quantified the association with aD1 and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin.

Markers associated with adverse pregnancy outcomes were aD1 (P<.001), anticardiolipin IgG (P<.001), β2-glycoprotein I IgG (P=.003), antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG (P<.001), antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgM (P=.03), and lupus anticoagulant (P<.001). Backward selection identified lupus anticoagulant, aD1, and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG for final adverse pregnancy outcome modeling: lupus anticoagulant odds ratio (OR) 7.0 (95% CI, 3.4-14.4), aD1 OR 12.1 (95% CI, 3.64-40.2), and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG OR 11.4 (95% CI, 5.2-25.2). Both aD1 and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG remained significant when lupus anticoagulant was removed from the model. Both aD1 and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG performed the best in ruling in adverse pregnancy outcomes. With a likelihood ratio less than 0.1, aD1 or antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG performed well for ruling out adverse pregnancy outcomes. Both aD1 and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG were associated with lupus anticoagulant positivity: OR 27.9 (95% CI, 12.1-64.0) if both were positive. Adverse pregnancy outcomes were highest in those with positive lupus anticoagulant, aD1, and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG (47.6%). In pregnant individuals with aPL, with or without SLE, aD1 and antiphosphatidylserine-prothrombin IgG are significant independent predictors of adverse pregnancy outcomes and are strongly associated with lupus anticoagulant. Combined use may identify patients at greatest risk for severe obstetric complications.","2025","Obstetrics and gynecology"

VE/VCO2 slope and partial pressure of end-tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) are both affected by ventilation/perfusion mismatch, but research on the utility of PetCO2 for risk stratification in major abdominal surgery is limited. We aimed to determine the correlation between VE/VCO2 slope and PetCO2 measured during preoperative cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET) and its association with major cardiopulmonary complications (MCPCs) or death following oesophageal and other major abdominal cancer surgeries. In a retrospective cohort of 116 patients undergoing preoperative CPET 2008-2023, VE/VCO2 slope and PetCO2 (kPa) were recorded. The main outcome was MCPC during hospitalisation or death ≤90 days of surgery. We determined threshold values for each measure, corresponding to 90% specificity, using receiver operating characteristics analysis. A strong negative correlation was found between PetCO2 after a 5-minute warm-up and VE/VCO2 slope (Pearson r = -.88). In oesophagus cancer, VE/VCO2 slope >38 and PetCO2 < 4.1 kPa (30.8 mmHg) were both significant thresholds for the main outcome. For other major abdominal surgery patients, threshold analyses were non-significant. The area under the curve to predict outcome was similar using VE/VCO2 slope (0.70, 95% confidence interval 0.51-0.89) as compared to PetCO2 (0.71, 0.53-0-90). Both preoperative VE/VCO2 slope and PetCO2 could identify subjects with a very high risk of complications following oesophageal resection, with similar prognostic utility. PetCO2 can be measured with simpler equipment and could therefore be useful when CPET is not available.","2025","Acta anaesthesiologica Scandinavica"

From the Treatment of Obese Pregnant Women (TOP) study, 232 mother-child pairs were included. We conducted an epigenome-wide association study on prePregBMI and CB DNAm (450k array), followed by causal mediation analyses to test whether DNAm may mediate effects of prePregBMI on  BMIz at age 36 months (BMIz36). DNAm at 5345 CpG sites annotated to 2842 genes, which were overrepresented in biological processes linked to carbohydrate metabolism and plasma lipoprotein particle clearance, was associated with prePregBMI (false discovery rate < 10%). Causal mediation analyses of 168 methylation sites associated with BMIz36 (p < 0.05) and overlapping with the 5345 prePregBMI-associated sites identified two sites on SYT7 and DEAF1, partially mediating the effect of prePregBMI on BMIz36 (p ≤ 0.01). After cross-validation, a methylation risk score including these two sites could predict the highest quartile of BMIz36 and fat mass (in grams) with area under the curve = 0.72 (95% CI: 0.58-0.85) and area under the curve = 0.71 (95% CI: 0.58-0.85), respectively.

In this longitudinal prospective observational study, serum samples were collected early (46 ± 24 h) and late (142 ± 52 h) post-injury from 70 patients with ischemic stroke, aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage, and traumatic brain injury that had outcomes dichotomized as favorable (modified Rankin Scores (mRS) 0-3) and unfavorable (mRS 4-6) three months post-injury. Lipidomic profiling of 1153 lipids, analyzed using statistical and machine learning methods, identified 153 lipids with late-stage significant outcome differences. Supervised machine learning pinpointed 12 key lipids, forming a combinatory prognostic equation with high discriminatory power (AUC 94.7 %, sensitivity 89 %, specificity 92 %; p < 0.0001). Enriched functions of the identified lipids were related to sphingolipid signaling, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and necroptosis (p < 0.05, FDR-corrected).

This study examined data from 18,469 adults with hypertension in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2018) and the mortality data from the National Death Index. The link between NPAR and mortality risk was visualized using restricted cubic splines. The optimal NPAR cut-off value for the prediction of survival outcomes was identified via maximally selected rank statistics. We employed weighted multivariate Cox regression and subgroup analyses to evaluate the relationship between NPAR and risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. We assessed NPAR's predictive accuracy for survival outcomes using time-related receiver operating characteristic analysis. During a median follow-up of 105 months, 31.8 % of 18,469 participants died, with 8.9 % from cardiovascular causes. Restricted cubic splines analysis showed a positive link between NPAR and both all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. Cox models indicated that higher NPAR (>1602.08) significantly raised risks of all-cause (HR 1.80, 95 % CI 1.54-2.12, p < 0.0001) and cardiovascular mortality (HR 1.54, 95 % CI 1.24-1.91, p < 0.0001). The stability of results was confirmed through stratified and interaction analyses. The area under the curve for 3-, 5-, and 10-year survival were 0.67, 0.65, and 0.63 for all-cause mortality and 0.61, 0.62, and 0.63 for cardiovascular mortality. Elevated NPAR independently raises the risk of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality in hypertensive patients, indicating its potential in the clinic as a practical tool for predicting long-term mortality risks and influencing treatment strategies.","2025","Maturitas"

The aim of this study was to determine if static and dynamic models are equivalent for the quantitative prediction of metabolic DDIs arising from competitive CYP inhibition. Drug parameter spaces were varied to simulate 30,000 DDIs between hypothetical substrates and inhibitors of CYP3A4. Predicted area under the plasma concentration-time profile ratios for substrates (AUCr = AUC(presence of precipitant)/AUC(absence of precipitant)) were compared between dynamic simulations (Simcyp® V21) and corresponding static calculations, giving an inter-model discrepancy ratio (IMDR = AUCrdynamic/AUCrstatic). Dynamic simulations were conducted using a 'population' representative and a 'vulnerable patient' representative with maximal concentration (Cmax) or average steady-state concentration (Cavg,ss) as the inhibitor driver concentrations. IMDRs outside the interval 0.8-1.25 were defined as discrepancy between models. The highest rate of IMDR <0.8 and IMDR >1.25 discrepancies in the 'population' representative was 85.9% and 3.1%, respectively, when using Cavg,ss as the inhibitor driver concentration. Using the 'vulnerable patient' representative showed the highest rate of IMDR >1.25 discrepancies at 37.8%. Static models are not equivalent to dynamic models for predicting metabolic DDIs via competitive CYP inhibition across diverse drug parameter spaces, particularly for vulnerable patients. Caution is warranted in drug development if static IVIVE approaches are used alone to evaluate metabolic DDI risks.","2025","Clinical pharmacokinetics"

1205,"39654452","Association between fatty acids and female infertility: dual evidence from a cross-sectional study and Mendelian randomization analysis.","Background: Infertility poses a considerable threat to female reproductive health on a global scale. Dietary pattern, as a modifiable lifestyle factor, is frequently recommended as an important intervention for infertility-related diseases. Fatty acids play a crucial role in maintaining the health of the female reproductive system. However, the available evidence on the specific relationship between various types of fatty acids and infertility remains insufficient and controversial. Methods: Initially, a cross-sectional study was conducted utilizing the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) database to collect data from women aged 18-45 years who met the inclusion criteria across the 2013-2020 cycles. Infertility was defined based on information gleaned from reproductive questionnaires. Fatty acid intake was determined by analyzing two 24 hour dietary recall interviews. Weighted logistic regression and weighted restricted cubic spline (RCS) analyses, incorporating covariate adjustments, were employed to preliminarily delineate the association between various types of fatty acids and proportions of fatty acid intake and female infertility risk. Model performance evaluation was carried out through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, complemented by the utilization of a nomogram diagram to gauge the infertility risk attributed to covariates. Genetic instrumental variables pertinent to diverse fatty acid profiles and female infertility were sourced from genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Mendelian randomization (MR), multivariable MR (MVMR) and reverse MR analyses were subsequently used to ascertain causality and reverse causality between distinct fatty acids and infertility, concurrently assessing for heterogeneity and horizontal pleiotropy. Results: In our NHANES analysis, a total of 3159 women were enrolled in the study, with a self-reported infertility prevalence of 11.49%. Infertile women exhibited significantly elevated intake of total omega-6 and omega-6/total fatty acids (TFA) compared to the controls. Weighted logistic regression models confirmed positive correlations between total omega-6 (continuous) and omega-6/TFA (categorical) and infertility risk, while omega-3 (continuous) intake demonstrated a negative correlation. Model 2, post rigorous multivariate covariate adjustment, showed improved predictive performance according to ROC curve analysis. Subgroup analysis suggested that the positive correlation between omega-6/TFA (continuous) and female infertility risk was not affected by stratification. Total omega-6 (continuous) emerged as a risk factor for infertile women aged 18-34 years. However, total saturated fatty acids (TSFAs, continuous), total omega-3 (continuous) and total polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs, categorical) were protective factors only in the infertile women with a BMI ≥ 25 kg m-2. The positive associations between total omega-6 (Q4) and omega-6/TFA (continuous and Q3-Q4) and infertility risk were consistent across all BMI subgroups. MR analysis employing inverse variance weighted (IVW) as the primary method and Bonferroni correction revealed that genetically predicted TSFAs, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs), omega-6 and MUFA/TFA were positively associated with female infertility risk, whereas PUFA/TFA showed a negative association. Importantly, the positive associations between MUFAs and omega-6 and infertility risk remained robust even after adjusting for potential confounders using MVMR analyses. Reverse MR analysis did not provide any evidence for reverse causality. The MR-Egger regression intercept and Cochran's Q test did not detect any heterogeneity or horizontal pleiotropy. Conclusions: This study presents compelling evidence to substantiate the link between diverse fatty acids, particularly omega-6 PUFAs, and the risk of female infertility. However, to fully comprehend the potential mechanisms and impact of distinct fatty acids and their compositional ratios on female infertility, extensive future research spanning fundamental and large-scale clinical inquiries is imperative.","2025","Food & function"

Conventional genomic testing requires high-quality tissue samples and is time-consuming and resource-consuming, and as a result, is not available for most patients, especially those in low-resource settings. We aimed to develop an annotation-free Deep learning-enabled artificial intelligence method to predict GEne Mutations (DeepGEM) from routinely acquired histological slides. In this multicentre retrospective study, we collected data for patients with lung cancer who had a biopsy and multigene next-generation sequencing done at 16 hospitals in China (with no restrictions on age, sex, or histology type), to form a large multicentre dataset comprising paired pathological image and multiple gene mutation information. We also included patients from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) publicly available dataset. Our developed model is an instance-level and bag-level co-supervised multiple instance learning method with label disambiguation design. We trained and initially tested the DeepGEM model on the internal dataset (patients from the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangzhou Medical University, Guangzhou, China), and further evaluated it on the external dataset (patients from the remaining 15 centres) and the public TCGA dataset. Additionally, a dataset of patients from the same medical centre as the internal dataset, but without overlap, was used to evaluate the model's generalisation ability to biopsy samples from lymph node metastases. The primary objective was the performance of the DeepGEM model in predicting gene mutations (area under the curve [AUC] and accuracy) in the four prespecified groups (ie, the hold-out internal test set, multicentre external test set, TCGA set, and lymph node metastases set). Assessable pathological images and multigene testing information were available for 3697 patients who had biopsy and multigene next-generation sequencing done between Jan 1, 2018, and March 31, 2022, at the 16 centres. We excluded 60 patients with low-quality images.

The DeepGEM model, trained on primary region biopsy samples, could be generalised to biopsy samples from lymph node metastases, with AUC values of 0·91 (95% CI 0·88-0·94) for EGFR and 0·88 (0·82-0·93) for KRAS and accuracy values of 0·85 (0·80-0·88) for EGFR and 0·95 (0·92-0·96) for KRAS and showed potential for prognostic prediction of targeted therapy. The model generated spatial gene mutation maps, indicating gene mutation spatial distribution.

Forty-one patients scheduled to undergo a posterolateral thoracotomy were recruited before surgery and followed prospectively for 2 months. The day before surgery, we experimentally induced secondary hyperalgesia at one of the two forearms and measured the change of perception to mechanical pinprick stimuli and the area of hyperalgesia. On postoperative Day 4, Day 15 and at the 2-month follow-up, patients were asked about their pain intensity at rest and during coughing and the area of secondary hyperalgesia around the scar as well as the change in perception to mechanical pinprick stimuli was measured. Of the 41 patients that were recruited only 20 could be analysed. Forty per cent reported pain at the 2-month follow-up. All of them reported cough-evoked pain and 10 per cent also reported pain at rest. A binary logistic regression model with both the magnitude and extent of experimentally induced secondary hyperalgesia was statistically significant (chi-squared = 12.439, p = 0.002, McFadden R2 = 0.462) and showed excellent discriminative power (AUC = 0.938) for the presence or absence of cough-evoked pain at the 2 month follow-up. Our findings indicate that the individual susceptibility to developing experimentally induced secondary hyperalgesia preoperatively may identify patients who are potentially vulnerable to develop persistent post-thoracotomy pain.

In the 7-day repeat-dose cohorts, 100-200 mg of BRII-693 was evaluated in eight participants (six active; two placebo) per cohort. In two 14-day repeat-dose cohorts, 150 mg of BRII-693 was evaluated in 12 participants (10 active, two placebo) each of non-Chinese and Chinese descent. No participant reported a severe or serious adverse event (AE) or an AE leading to death. Across all cohorts and for non-Chinese and Chinese participants, most AEs were mild. Cmax and area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) increased in a dose-proportional manner over the dose range of single- and repeat-dosing. Mean t1/2 was 2.58-4.37 hours and generally similar across single doses. An accumulation of exposure was observed following multiple doses with an accumulation ratio of 1.5 to 1.7 which was within the expected 1.3 to 2.5 range at steady state. Mean total clearance (CL) was similar between single and multiple dose administration, suggesting time-independent pharmacokinetics (PK). PK exposure was statistically equivalent between non-Chinese and Chinese participants. This phase 1 study demonstrates a favorable safety, tolerability, and PK profile of BRII-693 in healthy non-Chinese and Chinese participants.CLINICAL TRIALSThis study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov as NCT04808414.","2025","Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy"

This is reflected in most of the literature and in the EAU guidelines. However, recent studies have shown that multidimensional measures provide better prediction of outcomes. We performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of the prognostic accuracy of measures of stone size (PROSPERO reference CRD42022346967). We considered all studies reporting prognostic accuracy statistics on any intervention for kidney stones (extracorporeal shockwave lithotripsy [ESWL], ureterorenoscopy [URS], or percutaneous nephrolithotomy [PCNL]; Population) using multiplane measurements of stone burden (area in mm2 or volume in mm3; Intervention) in comparison to single-plane measurements of stone burden (size in mm; Intervention) for the study-defined stone-free rate (Outcome) in a PICO-framed question. We also assessed complication rates (overall and by Clavien-Dindo grade) and the operative time as secondary outcomes. Searches were made between 1970 and August 2023. We used the DeLong method to compare receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. Of 24 studies included in the review, 12 were eligible for comparative analysis with the DeLong test following meta-analysis of prognostic accuracy. For prediction of stone-free status, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was significantly higher for stone volume than for stone size (0.71 vs 0.67; p < 0.001). Subanalyses confirmed this for ESWL and URS, but not for PCNL. For URS, the AUC was also significantly higher for stone area than for stone size (0.79 vs 0.77; p < 0.001). Throughout all analyses, there was no difference in AUC between stone area and stone volume. There was high risk of bias for all analyses apart from the URS subanalyses. According to the limited data currently available, stone-free rates are predicted with significantly higher accuracy using multidimensional measures of stone burden in comparison to a single linear measurement. We reviewed different ways of measuring the size of stones in the kidney or urinary tract and compared their accuracy in predicting stone-free rates after treatment. We found that measurement of the stone area (2 dimensions) or stone volume (3 dimensions) is better than stone diameter (1 dimension) in predicting stone-free status after treatment.","2025","European urology open science"

This study included 680 patients from five hospitals, comparing a combination of eight feature screening methods and 11 machine learning algorithms to predict prognosis and construct integrated models. These models were assessed using nested cross-validation and various datasets, benchmarked against TNM stage and performance status. Evaluation metrics such as area under the curve (AUC) were applied. Prognostic models incorporating screened features showed superior performance compared to unselected models, with AR emerging as a key variable. Treatment recommendation models for surgical approaches, including DeepSurv, neural network multitask logistic regression (N-MTLR), and Kernel support vector machine (SVM), indicated that N-MTLR's recommendations were associated with survival benefits. Additionally, some patients identified as suitable for NAR were within groups previously considered for AR. In conclusion, three robust clinical models were developed to predict ICC prognosis and optimize surgical decisions, improving patient outcomes and supporting shared decision-making for patients and surgeons.","2025","Bioscience trends"

Currently, there is no biochemical parameter available for their diagnosis. The aim of our study is to investigate the potential of Elabela as a laboratory marker that could predict placenta previa and placenta accreta, both of which can lead to severe, life-threatening complications for the mother. In this study, which was conducted prospectively in two tertiary centers between 2020 and 2022, Elabela levels were examined in patient groups with placental insertion and invasion anomalies. SPSS program was used for comparative statistical analysis between groups. Of the 67 analyzed patients, 32 were in the control group, 12 were in the previa group, and 23 were in the accreta group. There was no statistically significant difference between the groups regarding age, BMI, number of curettages, presence of previous cesarean section, and smoking status. The Elabela level was measured at 135.6 ± 72.1 in the control group, 988.3 ± 925.5 in the previa group, and 376 ± 364.6 in the accreta group, with a statistically significant difference between the groups. The cut-off value of Elabela levels in the previa group was determined to be 304, with a sensitivity of 83.30 % and a specificity of 83.60 % (AUC = 0.909). In the accreta group, the cut-off value was 195.5, with a sensitivity of 60.90 % and a specificity of 61.40 % (AUC = 0.658).

This single-center, retrospective analysis included adult septic patients admitted to Saga University Hospital from 2013 to 2017, with available ROTEM data. Hypofibrinolysis was assessed using the lysis index at 60 min (LI60) in extrinsic thromboelastometry (EXTEM). Based on their LI60 values, patients were classified into three groups: Hyper (LI60 ≤ 85), Normal (LI60 86-96), and Hypo (LI60 ≥ 97). Among the 63 cases analyzed, the Hypo group showed significantly higher APACHEII and SOFA scores than the Normal group, indicating greater disease severity. Similarly, DIC and sepsis-induced coagulopathy (SIC) scores were notably higher in the Hypo group. The diagnostic performance of LI60 for ISTH-overt DIC showed an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.954, with an optimal cutoff value of 97 %, achieving 100 % sensitivity and 83.3 % specificity. The odds ratio for ISTH-overt DIC was 2.894, indicating a strong association between elevated LI60 and occurrence of DIC. Hypofibrinolysis predicted 28-day mortality and high SOFA scores (≥ 10) with high specificity and negative predictive value (NPV). A Kaplan-Meier curve revealed that the Hypo Group showed significantly worse clinical outcomes than the Normal and Hyper groups. For septic patients, fibrinolysis suppression presenting as ""hypofibrinolysis"" (elevated LI60) is associated with poor prognosis and risk of higher organ dysfunction. Moreover, it is a significant predictor of adverse clinical outcomes in sepsis.","2025","Thrombosis research"

Given the compact neuroanatomic organization of the basal ganglia, we hypothesized that bgICH spatial representation could predict postoperative functional outcomes. Patients undergoing minimally invasive surgical bgICH evacuation between 2013 and 2024 at one center were retrospectively reviewed. bgICH volumes were segmented and stereotactically localized using anatomic landmarks. Heat maps that identified bgICH spatial representation across functional outcome states were generated. Differential bgICH volume overlap with each heat map was calculated after subtracting out that patient's contribution to the map. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) was used to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of differential volume overlap for poor functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score of 4-6 within 1 year of surgery) and compared with that of the intracranial hemorrhage (ICH) score with a z test. Forty-five patients were included (62% men, 7% Caucasian, median age 53 years). Thirty-two patients (71%) had poor functional outcome (median follow-up 4.1 months), which was associated with increased age (P=0.032), bgICH volume (P=0.005), intraventricular hemorrhage severity (P=0.032), National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (P=0.006), and differential volume overlap (P<0.001). Anatomically, poor outcome was associated with bgICH extension into the anterior limb of the internal capsule (P=0.004), caudate (P=0.042), and temporal lobe (P=0.006). The AUC for differential volume overlap was 0.87 (95% CI: 0.76-0.97), which was higher than chance alone (P<0.001), but statistically similar to that (0.82 (0.71-0.97)) of the ICH score (P=0.545).

Multiple learner algorithms, including penalized regressions, random forests, gradient boosting machine, linear discriminant analysis and bootstrap aggregating decision trees were used. Data were split into training and test datasets. Patient demographics, medical and fertility diagnoses, partner information and geographic locations were analysed. A total of 77,631 oocyte-cryopreservation cycles (2014-2020) were analysed. Patient age averaged 34.5 years. Treatment indications varied: planned (35.6%), gender-related (0.1%), medically indicated (15.5%), oncologic (5.7%) and unknown (42.3%). Infertility diagnoses were less common: unexplained infertility (1.8%), age-related infertility (3.2%), diminished ovarian reserve (9.9%) and endometriosis (1.6%). An ensemble model combining bootstrap aggregation classification and regression trees, stochastic gradient boosting and linear discriminant analysis yielded the highest predictive accuracy on test set (balanced accuracy: 0.83, sensitivity: 0.76, specificity: 0.91), with a receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.90 and precision-recall curve and area under the curve of 0.57. Key factors influencing the likelihood of returning for oocyte use included patient age, presence of a partner, race or ethnicity, the clinic's geographic region and oocyte cryopreservation indication. This model demonstrated significant predictive accuracy, and is a valuable tool for patient counselling on oocyte cryopreservation. It helps to identify patients more likely to use stored oocytes, enhancing healthcare decision-making and the efficiency of gamete storage programmes.

Investigating blood-based protein biomarkers aims to simplify the diagnostic process and identify disease-associated changes before they can be seen by using imaging techniques. In this study, plasma and frozen whole blood cell pellets from NSCLC patients and healthy controls were processed using both classical and novel techniques to produce a unique set of four sample types from a single blood draw. These samples were analyzed using 12 immunoassays and liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry to collectively screen 3974 proteins. Analysis of all fractions produced a set of 522 differentially expressed proteins, with conventional blood analysis (proteomic analysis of plasma) accounting for only 7 of the total. Boosted regression tree analysis of the differentially expressed proteins produced a panel of 13 proteins that were able to discriminate between controls and NSCLC patients, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.864 for the set. Our rapid and reproducible (<10% CV for technical replicates) blood preparation and analysis methods enabled the production of high-quality data from only 30 μL of complex samples that typically require significant fractionation prior to proteomic analysis.

To develop and validate a score to predict fibrostenosis in EoE patients prior to endoscopy. We leveraged a large database of newly diagnosed EoE patients. Fibrostenosis was defined as esophageal stricture, luminal narrowing, or dilation performed during the diagnostic endoscopy. Patients were randomly divided into a development and validation set. We compared features between patients with and without fibrostenosis to inform the initial model and assess predictive ability, as measured by area under curve (AUC). We tested the model in the independent validation set and generated a score to predict low, medium and high fibrostenosis risk. In 655 newly diagnosed EoE patients in the development set, fibrostenosis was associated with age ≥ 18 years (OR 10.64; 95% CI 5.61-20.17), symptoms for ≥ 5 years prior to diagnosis (OR 2.07; 1.32-3.24), dysphagia (OR 3.72; 1.68-8.22), food impaction (OR 1.68; 1.07-2.62), and lack of abdominal pain (OR 0.28; 0.14-0.60). The model predicted fibrostenosis (AUC = 0.841). In the validation set (n = 654), AUC was preserved (0.831). A scoring system was generated, with scores of ≤ 2 being low risk (< 10% chance of stricture), 2.5-4.5 medium risk (10-50% stricture), and 5-6 high risk (> 50%). We developed and validated the PICK-UP-STRICS score to increase suspicion and detection of fibrostenotic disease in EoE using readily available clinical features prior to endoscopy.

All consecutive patients with ILVWT (maximal LV wall thickness ≥12 mm), preserved LV function and no significant aortic stenosis who underwent implantation of CIEDs at 2 French referral centers for rare and inheritable cardiac diseases were retrospectively evaluated. Clinical history, imaging, biological data, histologic data, and pacing lead parameters at the time of implantation were collected. Diagnostic categorization of ILVWT (CA, sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, or hypertensive heart disease) was determined according to guidelines. We included 218 patients with ILVWT, of which 150 had CA and 68 had sarcomeric hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or hypertensive heart disease. Ten patients (4.6%) had their device implanted before ILVWT diagnosis, 131 (60.1%) had their device implanted during the same hospitalization, and 77 (35.3%) in a subsequent hospitalization.

This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from 116 004 air passengers who entered Thailand through Suvarnabhumi Airport in Bangkok from April 2020 to September 2020. The incidence of SARS-CoV-2 infection, risk characteristics, and accuracy indices of symptom-based screening were calculated. The overall incidence of SARS-CoV-2 was 0.5%, or 540 infections per 100 000 air passengers. Identified risk factors included sex, nationality, continent of departure, on-arrival screening results, and month of travel. Positive screening results indicated a higher risk and positive likelihood ratio for SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, the on-arrival screening criteria demonstrated low sensitivity and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve. The current study confirms previous findings that the risk of SARS-CoV-2 infection during air travel is low. However, this might result from strict pre-departure screening and the SARS-CoV-2 test requirement for arriving passengers. The symptom-based screening criteria used upon arrival showed a low probability of identifying positive cases, suggesting that incorporating additional criteria could help detect asymptomatic infections.

Clinical algorithms have reduced CCT scans and hospitalisations by 10%. We aimed to established age-appropriate reference values for GFAP and UCH-L1 and evaluate their diagnostic test performance in identifying ciTBI in children. This study was a diagnostic test accuracy substudy within the PROS100B stepped wedge cluster randomised trial that included children aged 16 years or younger, clinically managed within 3 h of mTBI, with a GCS score of 15 requiring hospitalisation or CCT scan according to French Pediatric Society guidelines (equivalent to the intermediate risk group of the PECARN algorithm). Enrolment for PROS100B occurred from Nov 1, 2016, to Oct 31, 2021, at 11 hospital emergency departments in France. Stored blood samples collected from March 1, 2015, to Oct 31, 2015, from children aged 16 years or younger who were outpatients for allergic conditions unrelated to mTBI and free of neurological disease were used as a control group to calculate reference values of GFAP and UCH-L1 across four age groups (<6 months, 6 months to <2 years, 2 years to <4 years, and 4 years to <16 years). The diagnostic test performance of GFAP and UCH-L1, both above the reference range to identify ciTBI, was evaluated in the children with mTBI. GFAP and UCH-L1 were measured with the Alinity analyser (Abbott, Chicago, IL, USA). Reference values were calculated from GFAP and UCH-L1 measured in samples from 718 control children (378 [53%] boys and 340 [47%] girls). 531 children (334 [63%] boys and 197 [37%] girls) aged 0-16 years with mTBI were included. By applying our reference values for GFAP and UCH-L1 across four age groups the biomarker combination (both biomarkers above reference ranges) had a sensitivity of 100% (95% CI 69-100), a negative predictive value of 100% (99-100), a specificity of 67% (63-71), a positive likelihood ratio of 3·01 (2·67-3·40), a negative likelihood ratio of 0, and an area under the curve of 0·83 (0·81-0·85) in identifying ciTBI. Serum GFAP and UCH-L1 identify ciTBI in children with 100% sensitivity and 67% specificity, which could potentially reduce unnecessary CCT scans and hospitalisations in children with mTBI if implemented.

Patients treated with BI 409306 were recruited from two Phase II randomized, placebo-controlled trials in schizophrenia (NCT03351244) and attenuated psychotic disorders (NCT03230097). A machine-learning model was optimized to predict overall trial adherence using AiCure data collected over three monitoring periods (7/10/14 days), adherence cut-offs (0.6/0.7/0.8) and timepoints (Start/Mid/End). Area under the curve (AUC), false negative rate, and false omission rate averaged across 10 model cross-validations were analyzed. In NCT03351244, post hoc analyses compared time to first relapse in patients observed as adherent versus those predicted adherent by the model. Of 235 patients, 60.4 % demonstrated ≥80 % adherence. At an adherence cut-off of 0.8, the 14-day model performed best (AUC: 0.81 versus 0.79 [10-day], 0.77 [7-day]). Within the 14-day model, 0.6 cut-off was optimal (AUC: 0.87 versus 0.85 [0.7 cut-off], 0.81 [0.8 cut-off]). The Trial-End timepoint yielded the most accurate prediction (AUC: 0.92 versus 0.87 [Start], 0.85 [Mid]). Despite NCT03351244 not meeting the primary endpoint, a reduction in risk of first relapse with BI 409306 versus placebo was observed when analyzed with adherent completers (≥80 % across trial; HR = 0.485) and patients with predicted adherence ≥60 % (HR = 0.510). Adherence data with longer monitoring durations (14 days), lower adherence cut-offs (0.6), and later timepoints (Trial-End) produced most accurate adherence predictions. Accurate adherence prediction provides insights about medication adherence patterns that may help clinicians improve individual adherence.","2025","Schizophrenia research"

Our study aimed to investigate risk factors affecting NMOSD relapse and to establish a relapse prediction model within 1 year after the first onset, providing a reference for individualized diagnosis and treatment of NMOSD patients. We retrospectively analyzed clinical data of 102 NMOSD patients admitted to the Second Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University and the Second People's Hospital of Wuxi from January 2020 to August 2023 at their initial presentation. Patients were divided into relapse and non-relapse groups based on the occurrence of relapse within 1 year post-diagnosis. Clinical data were compared between groups, and the relationship between each factor and disease relapse was assessed using single-factor analysis. Binary logistic regression analysis was applied to identify independent risk factors for relapse within 1 year after the first onset of NMOSD, and a Nomogram relapse prediction model was developed and validated. Significant differences were observed in NLR, B lymphocyte level, NK cell count, immunosuppressant use, EDSS score, and spinal lesion segment length between the relapsed and non-relapsed groups (P < 0.05). Binary logistic regression analysis revealed that NLR, B lymphocyte level, NK cell count, non-use of immunosuppressants, and EDSS score were independent risk factors for relapse within 1 year after the first onset of NMOSD. NLR, B lymphocyte level, and EDSS score were positively correlated with the risk of disease relapse, while NK cell count was negatively correlated. A Nomogram prediction model was constructed based on these independent risk factors. The model's C index was 0.788 (95 % CI: 0.698-0.878, P = 0.000), indicating good discrimination. The Bootstrap-corrected C index was 0.787, suggesting robust calibration. Decision curve analysis confirmed the model's clinical utility. Peripheral blood NLR, B lymphocyte level, NK cell count, non-use of immunosuppressants, and EDSS score are risk factors for NMOSD relapse within 1 year after the first onset and can serve as predictive indicators. Early identification of the high-risk relapse group is crucial for the individualized management of NMOSD patients.","2025","Multiple sclerosis and related disorders"

The goal of this study was to determine the feasibility of using time-dependent diffusion MRI (dMRI) for microstructural characterization of PAs. The study included 54 participants, 24 with functioning PA and 30 with nonfunctioning PA. Time-dependent dMRI of the pituitary gland was performed using an inner field-of-view echo-planar imaging based on 2-dimensional-selective radiofrequency excitations with oscillating gradient and pulsed gradient preparation (effective diffusion time: 7.1 and 36.3 ms) at b-values of 0 and 1000 seconds/mm2. Each tumor had its apparent diffusion coefficients (ADCs) measured at two diffusion times (ADC7.1 ms and ADC36.3 ms), its ADC change (cADC), and relative ADC change. The mean values of diffusion parameters were compared between functioning and nonfunctioning PAs. We compared the diffusion parameters of nonfunctioning PAs with those of each type of hormone-producing PAs. The diagnostic performances of the diffusion parameters were assessed. The cADC was significantly higher in functioning PAs than nonfunctioning PAs (p = .0124). The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis revealed that cADC (area under the ROC curve [AUC] = .677, p = .017) is effective in distinguishing between functioning and nonfunctioning PAs. The cADC was significantly higher in growth hormone (GH)-producing PAs compared to nonfunctioning PAs (p = .006). The ROC curve analysis indicated that cADC (AUC = .771, p < .001) effectively distinguishes between GH-producing and nonfunctioning PAs. The cADC derived from time-dependent dMRI could distinguish between functioning and nonfunctioning PAs, particularly those producing GH.","2025","Journal of neuroimaging : official journal of the American Society of Neuroimaging"

One hundred thirty-nine FTD patients (60 behavioural variant [bvFTD],13 semantic behavioural variant of FTD [sbvFTD], 28 progressive supranuclear palsy [PSP], 21 semantic [svPPA] and 17 nonfluent [nfvPPA] variants of primary progressive aphasia) and 116 HC were administered the CATS-A, yielding an Affective Recognition Quotient (ARQ), which was used as outcome measure. Age- and education-adjusted, regression-based norms were derived in HC. In patients, the ARQ was assessed for its internal reliability, factorial validity and construct validity by testing its association with another social cognition paradigm, the Story-Based Empath Task (SET). The diagnostic accuracy of the ARQ in discriminating patients from HC, genetic cases from HC and patient groups among each other was tested via ROC analyses. In the whole FTD cohort, CATS-A proved to be underpinned by a mono-component factor (51.1%) and was internally consistent (McDonald's ω = 0.76). Moreover, the ARQ converged with the SET (r(122) = 0.50; p < 0.001) and optimally discriminated HC from both the whole cohort (AUC = 0.89) and each clinical syndrome (AUC range: 0.83-0.92). Conversely, CATS-A subtests were able to distinguish patient groups. The ARQ score from the CATS-A distinguishes FTD clinical syndromes from HC with high accuracy, making it an excellent tool for immediate use in clinical practice.","2025","European journal of neurology"

However, it often includes tumor morphology, which is usually assessed with imaging studies or pathologic analysis, leading to limited predictive performance. Therefore, the aim of this study was to develop a simple and low-cost prognostic score for HCC based on serum biomarkers in routine clinical practice. A total of 3,100 patients were recruited. The least absolute shrinkage and selector operation (LASSO) algorithm was used to select the significant factors for overall survival. The prognostic score was devised based on multivariate Cox regression of the training cohort. Model performance was assessed by discrimination and calibration. Albumin (ALB), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) were selected by the LASSO algorithm. The three variables were incorporated into multivariate Cox regression to create the risk score (APP score = 0.390* ln (ALP) + 0.063* ln(AFP) - 0.033*ALB). The C-index, K-index, and time-dependent AUC of the score displayed significantly better predictive performance than 5 other models and 5 other staging systems. The model was able to stratify patients into three different risk groups. In conclusion, the APP score was developed to estimate survival probability and was used to stratify three strata with significantly different outcomes, outperforming other models in training and validation cohorts as well as different subgroups. This simple and low-cost model could help guide individualized follow-up.","2025","Bioscience trends"

This study further explored the effect of FS60 on Cur bioavailability in vivo to assess the significance of this delivery method. In this study, we optimized the formulation parameters of FS60-curcuminoid aggregates (FC) and studied their effects on Cur pharmacokinetics in rats. Results showed that the optimized aggregates had an encapsulation efficiency (EE) of 88.22 % and hydrodynamic diameter (DH) of 231.48 nm. Additionally, administering FC significantly increased curcumin glucuronide (Cur-O-Glu) levels. The Cmax was 51 times higher and AUC0-12h was 19 times higher than curcuminoid alone. Moreover, FS60 intervention for seven days increased the absorption speed of Cur-O-Glu into the bloodstream. Further mechanistic studies indicated that FS60 promoted Cur ingestion, increased UGT expression, and inhibited enterocyte transporters, allowing large amounts of Cur-O-Glu to enter the bloodstream. Moreover, the gut microbiota modulated by FS60 accelerated the mutual conversion of pentose and gluconate to provide sufficient glucuronic acid for the glucuronidation of Cur in enterocytes. Consequently, the nano delivery system composed by FS60 and curcuminoid facilitated gastrointestinal Cur glucuronidation and Cur-O-Glu absorption.","2025","International journal of biological macromolecules"

However, evidence to support these criteria are limited. Consecutive interstitial lung disease (ILD) patients who underwent HRCT between 2016 and 2021 in three medical centers were included. We assessed the prevalence of HPCF in each ILD and their association with HP diagnosis. We evaluated the impact of HPCF amount for HP diagnosis and the performance of the radiologic criteria by the ATS/JRS/ALAT and CHEST HP guidelines. 436 patients with ILD were included (mean age 66, 48 % females), of them, 56 (13 %) with HP. All four HPCF were more prevalent in HP than in non-HP ILD (p < 0.001 for all). In multivariate analysis, air-trapping was the strongest independent predictor (AOR 4.1, 95 % CI 2-8.4, p < 0.001). Centrilobular nodules were present almost exclusively in HP and smoking-related ILD. The amount of HPCF in HRCT had an excellent predictive ability for HP diagnosis (receiver operating characteristic AUC 0.85, 95 % CI 0.80-0.90). The radiologic criteria of both guidelines had high specificity for ""typical HP"" and high sensitivity for ""compatible with HP"", although with low positive predictive values. Our findings remained robust even when including only patients that had a diagnostic biopsy. The presence and amount of HPCF in HRCT predicted HP diagnosis in real-life settings.

Of these, the aMPV types A (aMPV-A), B (aMPV-B) and C (aMPV-C) are frequently detected in Chinese waterfowl and live poultry markets. Therefore, the rapid and accurate identification of these subtypes is of paramount importance in order to halt the spread of the disease. In this study, we have developed a multiplex real-time PCR assay endowed with the capacity to simultaneously discriminate aMPV-A, aMPV-B, and aMPV-C. This method demonstrates remarkable specificity, selectively amplifying aMPV-A, aMPV-B, and aMPV-C without cross-reactivity with other common avian pathogens. Furthermore, this method exhibits high sensitivity, with a detection threshold of 8.5 × 102 copies/μL for aMPV-A, aMPV-B, and aMPV-C. Moreover, the assay demonstrates reproducibility, as evidenced by intra- and inter-assay variability, with a coefficient of variation between 0.21% and 1.91%. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that the multiplex real-time PCR assay exhibited high specificity and sensitivity (100.0% and 100.0% for aMPV-A, 90.9% and 100.0% for aMPV-B, 100% and 96.8% for aMPV-C) when compared with the classical aMPV real-time RT-PCR.

A 54-year-old patient with carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii ventriculitis was given cefiderocol intravenously 2 g every 6 h (each dose administered over 3 h). Serial samples were obtained over a dosing interval at steady state, and cefiderocol concentrations in serum and CSF were assayed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Cefiderocol serum concentration-time profile was characterized by a one-compartment model with zero-order input. Penetration into CSF was estimated as the CSF AUC/unbound serum AUC ratio. Observed total serum concentrations ranged between 24.6 and 76.7 mg/L, while CSF concentrations were approximately 10.0 mg/L. The AUC0-6 of the free drug in serum and CSF were 181.6 and 60.2 mg h/L, respectively. We observed minimal fluctuation of cefiderocol concentrations in CSF, questioning the conventional reliance on CSF/serum area under the curve (AUC) ratio as a measure of CNS penetration. Our experience suggests that a single CSF concentration (random or trough) could be directly compared to the minimum inhibitory concentration, offering a potentially simpler approach to evaluate dosing adequacy.","2025","Pharmacotherapy"

This study involved 600 PA patients underwent endoscopic TSS at Shandong Provincial Hospital from 2021 to 2023. Among these patients, 82 developed postoperative DI while 518 did not. The cohort was randomly divided into training (n = 360) and validation (n = 240) groups at 6:4 ratios by R software. Clinical parameters and radiographic features were evaluated using univariable and multivariable logistic regression to construct a predictive nomogram for post-endoscopic TSS DI risk. Model performance was assessed using ROC curves, calibration plots, and decision curve analysis. Subgroup analysis was used to evaluate the model's ability to discriminate between transient and permanent DI. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression analyses on the training group identified several independent risk factors for post-endoscopic TSS DI, including maximum tumor diameter, Knosp grade, Esposito grade, recurrent PA, and pituitary stalk deviation angle. A nomogram was developed based on these factors, demonstrating robust predictive accuracy with ROC areas under curve of 0.840 for the training group and 0.815 for the validation group. Calibration plots indicated excellent agreement between predicted and observed probabilities of postoperative DI. DCA curves highlighted the nomogram's efficacy in guiding clinical decision-making. Subgroup analysis showed that the model was able to discriminate between transient and permanent DI, and the AUC was 0.652 (95% CI 0.525-0.794). This study presents a nomogram designed to predict postoperative DI risk in patients undergoing endoscopic TSS for PA. Internal and external validations underscored the model's high accuracy, calibration, and clinical utility. Simultaneously, the model can also assess the development risk of permanent DI.

While landslides have been extensively studied, much of the focus has been on developing static frameworks for landslide susceptibility, with relatively little exploration of spatiotemporal modeling. Furthermore, previous studies have often overlooked the spatiotemporal impacts of climate change and dynamic socio-economic factors on landslide susceptibility and risk. This has resulted in a lack of understanding of how landslide risk will evolve in the future. Consequently, this study proposes a modeling approach to simulate the dynamics of landslide susceptibility and exposure population over the next 80 years. The approach involves a series of novel modeling experiments using rainfall-induced landslide data collected over the past decade in Jiangxi Province, using a GAMs that considers the effects of spatial relationships and spatio-temporal cross-validation, with an AUC of 0.885 and an error rate of 15.32%, and combining with the CMIP6 precipitation data to the direct effect of climate change on landslide susceptibility. In addition, a dynamic risk prediction model combining static and dynamic populations was developed to provide a more comprehensive understanding of future landslide impacts. This research framework serves as a scientific foundation and valuable reference for comprehending the effects of climate change on landslide hazards and their management in urban planning and risk mitigation.

This has raised concerns regarding a potential trend of excessive surgeries. This study aimed to propose a predictive model based on digital radiography (DR) radiomics to objectively assess the need for TKR surgery in patients with knee osteoarthritis (KOA) and to improve risk stratification, thereby avoiding unnecessary surgeries. A retrospective study was conducted on 1,785 KOA patients from January 2017 to December 2022. Radiomics features were extracted from DR images to quantify lesion phenotypes, followed by a two-step feature selection to derive robust signatures. Multiple models were constructed using independent risk factors and radiomics features, and these models were validated using logistic regression. The performance of the models was evaluated via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis. A multivariable Cox regression-derived nomogram was used to predict operation-free survival (OFS), and the patients were categorized into high- or low-risk groups based on risk stratification. Kaplan-Meier curves were used to compare OFS between the two groups. During a follow-up period of at least one year, 962 of 1785 (53.89 %) patients underwent TKR. Age, presence of radiographic KOA (RKOA), and Kellgren-Lawrence (KL) grading were identified as independent risk factors for OFS. The combined RKOA model (including age, presence of RKOA, and Radscore; AUC = 0.969) and combined KL model (including age, KL grading, and Radscore; AUC = 0.968) showed similar performance, with both significantly outperforming other models (p < 0.001). The 1-, 2-, and 3-year AUCs for the RKOA nomogram were 0.891, 0.916, and 0.920, respectively, whereas those for the KL nomogram were 0.890, 0.914, and 0.931. The thresholds of 68.92 (RKOA nomogram) and 64.41 (KL nomogram) were derived from the median nomogram scores and used to stratify patients into high- and low-risk groups. K-M curves demonstrated that the risk stratification system effectively distinguished between high- and low-risk groups, with the high-risk group being more likely to require TKR. Two nomograms incorporating age, RKOA (or KL grading), and Radscore were developed to predict 3-years OFS for KOA patients and establish risk thresholds, potentially guiding personalized non-surgical treatments during the OFS period.","2025","European journal of radiology"

To evaluate the diagnostic performance of plasma pTau181, Aβ42/Aβ40, and pTau181/Aβ42 ratios in predicting CSF amyloid status in a real-life clinical setting. Data from consecutive patients whose plasma and CSF samples sent to our laboratory between March and October 2022, were retrospectively analyzed. Plasma and CSF pTau181, Aβ42, and Aβ40 levels were measured using the Lumipulse G600II platform. CSF amyloid status was classified as amyloid-positive (A+) or amyloid-negative (A-) based on the Aβ42/Aβ40 ratio. Statistical analyses included Spearman correlation, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, and multivariate logistic regression to evaluate biomarker performance. Among 165 individuals (83 females), 29.1% were classified as A+. Significant correlations were found between plasma and CSF biomarkers, with the highest for the pTau181/Aβ42 ratio (ρ=0.620, p < 0.0001). ROC analysis showed the pTau181/Aβ42 ratio had the highest diagnostic performance (AUC 0.818), followed by pTau181 (AUC 0.794) and Aβ42/Aβ40 (AUC 0.775). Combining plasma biomarkers in age-adjusted models improved diagnostic accuracy (AUC up to 0.846).

To investigate the relationship between irregular pulsation on four-dimensional CT angiography (4D-CTA) and aneurysm wall enhancement (AWE) on vessel wall MRI (VW-MRI), and to evaluate their ability to identify symptomatic IAs. This retrospective study included consecutive patients with IAs who underwent 4D-CTA and VW-MRI between March 2018 and May 2023. IAs were categorized as asymptomatic and symptomatic. The presence of irregular pulsation was identified on 4D-CTA video. Qualitative and quantitative AWE were evaluated. Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify the parameters associated with symptoms. 192 patients with 216 aneurysms (167 asymptomatic and 49 symptomatic) were included. IAs with irregular pulsation had significantly higher wall enhancement index (WEI) than IAs without irregular pulsation (median (IQR), 0.5 (0.2-1.1) vs 0.2 (0.0-0.6), P<0.001). Symptomatic IAs had significantly higher WEI than asymptomatic IAs (median (IQR), 0.7 (0.3-1.5) vs 0.2 (0.0-0.5), P<0.001), and more irregular pulsations (79.6% vs 25.1%, P<0.001). Both irregular pulsation (OR=6.86; 95% CI 2.62 to 17.96; P<0.001) and WEI (OR=2.56; 95% CI 1.14 to 5.71; P=0.022) were independently associated with symptoms. Combination of irregular pulsation and WEI achieved the highest area under the curve of 0.86 in identifying symptomatic aneurysms compared with irregular pulsation or WEI alone (P<0.001 and P=0.002, respectively). In a large cohort of patients with unruptured IAs who underwent 4D-CTA and VW-MRI, both irregular pulsation and WEI were independently associated with symptoms. Such measures could identify IAs at higher risk of growth or rupture.","2025","Journal of neurointerventional surgery"

If hypermobility of the hip analysed with the pelvic femoral angle (∆PFA) has a high risk of impingement, the correlation between the range of motion of the hip from a standing to a flexed seated position and its implication in adverse spinopelvic mobility has not been described. A series of 337 patients treated with primary THA underwent lateral x-ray in standing and flexed seated positions to analyse ∆SPT, ∆PFA and spinopelvic parameters. The objectives were to establish a ∆PFA threshold associated with a ∆SPT ⩾20° and to subsequently investigate its influence in conjunction with spinopelvic risk factors on the occurrence of adverse spinopelvic mobility. The area under the curve was 0.904 (95%CI, 0.864-0.945) for ∆PFA to predict ∆SPT ⩾ 20°; it was predicted by ∆PFA ⩾ 95° with a sensitivity of 91.7% and a specificity of 74.4% at the Youden optimal threshold. Patients with a ∆SPT < 20° (277 patients) had a mean ∆PFA of 83° compared to 110° if ∆SPT ⩾ 20° (60 patients) (p < 0.001). Patients with a ∆PFA < 95° (203 patients) had a mean ∆SPT of -6° compared to 18° if ∆PFA ⩾ 95° (134 patients) (p < 0.001). ∆PFA ⩾ 95° rates were 95% (57/60) and 27.8% (77/200) in patients with ∆SPT ⩾ 20° and ∆SPT < 20°, respectively (OR 49.35; CI, 15.01-162.28; p < 0.001). High mobility of the hip (∆PFA ⩾ 95°) seems to be a necessary condition for adverse spinopelvic mobility.

Initially, we curated a prospective dataset, dubbed the primary cohort, by aggregating patient data that was consecutively enrolled across two centers from November 2018 to November 2021. Unstable aneurysms were defined as those with symptoms, morphological change or ruptured during follow-up periods. We introduce a specialized ensemble learning framework, termed the Hybrid Model, which synergistically combines two heterogeneous base learning algorithms: 4D-Flow logistic regression (4D-Flow-LR) and Multi-crop Attention Branch Network (MicroAB-Net). The ability of the hybrid model to predict aneurysm instability was compared with baseline models: PHASES (population, hypertension, age, size, earlier rupture, and site) LR, ELAPSS (earlier subarachnoid hemorrhage, location, age, population, size, and shape) LR, aneurysm wall enhancement (AWE) LR, and Radiomics using the area under the curve (AUC) with Delong's test. Finally, the Hybrid Model was further validated in the validation cohort (patients enrolled between December 2021 to May 2022). In the primary cohort, 189 patients (144 women [76.2 ​%]; aged 58.90 years ​± ​10.32) with 213 IAs were included.

In recent years, it has been found to be associated with several neurodegenerative disorders. In this study, we examined the relationship between IgG N-glycans and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) in a high-risk population for MCI, specifically patients with cerebrovascular stenosis. In a case-control study, we investigated IgG N-glycans and cytokines in MCI and non-MCI patients in a population with cerebrovascular stenosis. A multifactorial logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate the potential association between IgG N-glycoprotein and MCI, with familial error rates being corrected for using the Benjamin-Hochberg method. To construct discriminatory models, logistic stepwise regression was employed and evaluated for their diagnostic efficacy. A statistically significant difference was found in eight of the IgG-GPs between the two groups. Three IgG-GPs were correlated with MCI, with an overall false discovery rate <0.05. Specifically, IgG-GP7 (non-sialylated glycan) was positively correlated with MCI, while IgG-GP14 (digalactosylated glycans) and IgG-GP18 (bis-sialylated glycan) were negatively correlated with MCI. The model constructed by combining IgG N-glycans (IgG-GP7, IgG-GP14, IgG-GP18) and cytokines (IL-1β, IL-10, BDNF and VEGF) demonstrated the highest diagnostic efficacy [AUC: 0.939, 95 % CI: (0.910-0.967)]. In the present study, we observed that agalactosylation and no-sialylation play a role in the progression of MCI by influencing the pro-inflammatory impact of IgG. The integration of IgG N-glycan and cytokines into a discriminative model demonstrated strong diagnostic efficacy, suggesting its potential use as a screening tool for early prediction of MCI in patients with cerebrovascular stenosis.","2025","International immunopharmacology"

Gene expression profiles were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database to identify differentially expressed immune-related genes (IRG-DEGs). We employed five machine learning algorithms-LASSO, random forest (RF), boosted regression trees (BRT), XGBoost, and support vector machine recursive feature elimination (SVM-RFE) to identify biomarkers derived from IRG-DEGs associated with the diagnosis of PAH, incorporating them into the IRG-DEGs panel. Validation of these biomarker levels in lung tissue was conducted in a hypoxia-induced mouse model of PAH, investigating the correlation between AIMP1, IL-15, GLRX, SOD1, Fulton's index (RVHI), and the ratio of pulmonary artery medial thickness to external diameter (MT%). Subsequently, we developed a nomogram model based on the IRG-DEGs panel in lung tissue for diagnosing PAH. The expression, distribution, and pseudotime analysis of these biomarkers across various immune cell types were assessed using single-cell sequencing datasets. Finally, we evaluated the diagnostic utility of the nomogram model based on the IRG-DEGs panel in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) for diagnosing PAH. A total of 36 upregulated and 17 downregulated IRG-DEGs were identified in lung tissue from patients with PAH. AIMP1, IL-15, GLRX, and SOD1 were subsequently selected as novel immune-related biomarkers for PAH through the aforementioned machine learning algorithms and incorporated into the IRG-DEGs panel. Experimental results from mice with PAH validated that the expression levels of AIMP1, IL-15, and GLRX in lung tissue were elevated, while SOD1 expression was significantly reduced. Additionally, GLRX and AIMP1 exhibited positive correlations with Fulton's index (RVHI). The expression levels of GLRX, IL-15, and AIMP1 showed positive correlations with MT%, whereas SOD1 exhibited negative correlations with MT%. Analysis of single-cell sequencing data further revealed that the levels of IRG-DEG panel members gradually increased during the pseudotime trajectory from PBMCs to macrophages, correlating with macrophage activation. The area under the curve (AUC) for diagnosing PAH using a nomogram model based on the IRG-DEGs panel derived from lung tissue samples and PBMCs was ≥0.969 and 0.900, respectively. We developed an IRG-DEGs panel containing AIMP1, IL-15, GLRX, and SOD1, which may facilitate the diagnosis of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH).

Consequently, identifying novel differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and therapeutic targets is of paramount importance to IgAN. The Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) databases GSE37460 and GSE104948, containing data from renal tissue of patients with IgAN and normal controls, were screened for DEGs, followed by enrichment pathway analysis. The potential key gene for IgAN, CD36, was identified through the single-cell sequencing dataset GSE166793 and histopathological analysis of patients with IgAN. Clinical and pathological data from patients with IgAN were collected to analyze the correlation between CD36 expression and various indicators in renal tissue, thereby evaluating the influence of CD36 on IgAN progression. The accuracy of the risk score model was assessed using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. Finally, CD36 expression was knocked down to explore its regulatory role in polymeric IgA1 (pIgA1)-stimulated mouse mesangial cells (MCs). CD36 was identified as a key DEG from two GEO databases and a single-cell sequencing dataset. Compared to peritumoral normal tissues, CD36 expression levels were significantly increased in the IgAN group. Statistically significant differences were observed between M0 and M1, E0 and E1, S0 and S1, C0 and C1-2 in the updated Oxford Classification. CD36 expression showed positive correlations with 24-hour proteinuria, serum creatinine, and levels of fibrosis-related and autophagy-related factors in renal tissue. Additionally, CD36 and fibrosis-related factors were significantly elevated in MCs following pIgA1 stimulation. CD36 knockdown resulted in decreased extracellular matrix (ECM) accumulation in pIgA1-stimulated MCs. RNA-seq analysis of MCs with CD36 knockdown revealed significant alterations in autophagy and CD36 silencing restored autophagy levels in MCs treated with the autophagy inhibitor 3MA. Our study confirmed that CD36 expression increases with the clinical progression of IgAN and CD36 knockdown alleviates MCs injury by inhibiting ECM accumulation and restoring autophagy.","2025","International immunopharmacology"

This is a retrospective study, encephalitis patients who were HSV-positive (HSV- 1,HSV-2 and VZV) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in 23 years' time frame were compared. Clinical, electrophysiological, imaging, and laboratory data were analyzed. We identified 47 HSV-1, 8 HSV-2 and 216 with VZV patients with a molecular CSF PCR diagnosis. The median age at diagnosis was 63.3 (interquartile range(IQR) 50.42-72.52) for HSV-1, 46.79 (IQR 36.55-55.05) for HSV-2 and 60.33. (IQR 33.78-74.11) for VZV (p = 0.14). The mean follow up time was 6.25 ± 5.92 years for the group as whole. Among HSV-1 patients, during the follow-up period, 26 patients (55.31 %) died. Ten deaths occurred within the first year, with a median age of death of 70.6 [63.53-75.39]. Patients who died were older (70.6 [63.53-75.39 vs. 48.59 [37.88-61.71], p < 0.001), had a longer time to treatment initiation (4.01 ± 5.69 vs. 1.96 ± 3.58 days, p = 0.026), with cancer comorbidities more prevalent (42.3 % vs. 0 %, p < 0.001). Univariate analysis showed older age (HR 1.07, 95 % CI 1.03-1.10, p < 0.01), and cancer comorbidity (HR 5.55, 95 % CI 2.31-13.33, p < 0.001) were associated with significantly higher risk for mortality. Multivariate analysis confirmed that older age (HR 1.096, 95 % CI 1.04-1.15, p < 0.001), cancer comorbidity (HR 11.02, 95 % CI 2.76-43.9, p < 0.001) and lower lymphocyte count (HR 0.97, 95 % CI 0.95-0.99, p = 0.032) influenced mortality risk.

Of patients with consecutive acute stroke who underwent MT from September 2014 through December 2019, those who were pre-morbidly independent were enrolled. Infarct volume on DWI was measured at admission (DWIinitial) and 24 h after admission (DWI24h) with semi-automated imaging software. Infarct growth (IG) was calculated as the difference between DWI24h and DWIinitial. Factors associated with a favorable outcome (mRS score 0-2) 3 months after stroke onset were assessed by multivariable analyses. Model performance was evaluated with the C-statistic. A total of 251 patients (165 male [66 %], median age 75 [IQR 67-81] years, median NIHSS score 15 [7-21]) were enrolled in the present study.

Emerging evidence suggests that circRNAs may influence pharmacodynamic responses to clopidogrel. A total of 25 CR and 25 non-clopidogrel resistance (NCR) patients were enrolled. To identify circRNAs and miRNAs associated with CR, a microarray analysis was performed on RNA samples from 5 CR to 5 NCR patients. Based on the 10 most dysregulated circRNAs, a circRNA-miRNA network was constructed to explore target interactions. Next, the expression of selected circRNAs and their targeted mRNAs was measured, and their diagnostic value for CR was evaluated. Through joint analysis, the candidate miRNAs were identified and verified by RT‒PCR. Finally, after THLE-2 cells were cultivated and transfected with plasmids, the interactions among circ_007695, miR-4512 and COL19A1 were detected. Our present study revealed circRNA and miRNA microarray expression profiles in CR and NCR patients and constructed a circRNA‒miRNA network. Moreover, in the CR group, hsa_circ_0076837, hsa_circ_0057714, and hsa_circ_0076957 were downregulated, and the mRNA expression of AOX1 and COL19A1 was also lower in these CR patients. ROC curve analysis indicated that hsa_circ_0057714 (targeting AOX1) and hsa_circ_0076957 (targeting COL19A1) may serve as reliable biomarkers for distinguishing CR. Furthermore, we revealed that the level of miR-4512 was greater in CR and circ-0076957 could regulate COL19A1 expression by targeting miR4512 in THLE-2 cells. These findings highlight hsa_circ_0057714 and hsa_circ_0076957 as novel biomarkers for CR and suggest that circ-0076957 may regulate COL19A1 expression by targeting miR-4512, providing insights that could improve management of clopidogrel resistance in CAD.","2025","European journal of pharmacology"

We assessed the activity and safety outcomes of primary tumour stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) followed by conventional chemoradiotherapy to the lymph nodes and consolidation immunotherapy in patients with unresectable locally advanced NSCLC. In this multicentre, single-arm, phase 2 trial, patients aged 18 years and older were enrolled at eight regional cancer centres in North Carolina and South Carolina, USA. Patients were eligible if they had stage II-III, unresectable, locally advanced NSCLC (any histology), with peripheral or central primary tumours that were 7 cm or smaller, excluding central tumours within 2 cm of involved nodal disease, and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2. Patients who had previously received systemic therapy or radiotherapy were excluded. Participants received SBRT to the primary tumour (50-54 Gy in three to five fractions) followed by standard radiotherapy (planned up to 60 Gy in 30 2 Gy fractions) to the involved lymph nodes with concurrent platinum doublet chemotherapy (either paclitaxel 50 mg/m2 intravenously plus carboplatin area under the curve 2 mg/mL per min every 7 days for a total of six 1-week cycles or etoposide 50 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1-5 and days 29-33 plus cisplatin 50 mg/m2 intravenously on days 1, 8, 29, and 36 for two cycles of 4 weeks). An amendment to the protocol (Dec 11, 2017) permitted the administration of consolidation durvalumab at the discretion of the treating investigator. An additional protocol amendment on Jan 13, 2021, directed patients without disease progression after chemoradiotherapy to receive consolidation durvalumab (10 mg/kg intravenously on day 1 and day 15 of a 4-week cycle for up to 12 cycles or 1500 mg intravenously on day 1 of a 4-week cycle for up to 12 cycles). The primary endpoint was 1-year progression-free survival (per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumours version 1.1), assessed in all participants who received at least one fraction of SBRT and had radiological follow-up data up to 1 year. A 1-year progression-free survival rate of greater than 60% was required to reject the null hypothesis and show significant improvement in 1-year progression-free survival. One-sided exact binomial tests were used to compare the primary endpoint versus the historical control 1-year progression-free survival rate used to determine the sample size. Safety was assessed in all patients who received at least one fraction of SBRT. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT03141359, and is closed to accrual.

Of the 61 patients enrolled, 47 received at least one dose of consolidation durvalumab. As of data cutoff (July 12, 2023), median follow-up was 29·5 months (IQR 14·9-47·1). 1-year progression-free survival was 62·7% (90% CI 51·2-73·2; one-sided p=0·39, compared with the historical control rate), with 37 of 59 evaluable participants progression free and alive 1 year after enrolment (n=14 progressed, n=8 died). The most common grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events were decreased neutrophil count (nine [15%] of 61 patients), decreased white blood cell count (five [8%]), and anaemia (four [7%]). Treatment-related serious adverse events occurred in 11 (18%) of 61 patients, which included lung infection (three [5%]), pneumonitis (two [3%]), decreased neutrophil count (two [3%]), febrile neutropenia (two [3%]), and dyspnoea, hypoxia, respiratory failure, sinus tachycardia, bronchial infection, and acute kidney injury (each in one [2%] patient).

1252,"39615232","A topological-aware automatic grading model corneal epithelial damage evaluation from full Corneal Fluorescence Staining images.","Corneal Fluorescence Staining (CFS) imaging is commonly employed for assessing corneal epithelial damage. Automating the grading of CFS images can minimize subjectivity in clinical evaluations and enhance diagnostic efficiency. Existing methods typically depend on the texture and morphological information extracted from whole CFS images, often neglecting the spatial and distribution information between stained regions. This oversight hinders the accurate evaluation of corneal epithelial injury states. This study proposes a three-stage automatic corneal epithelial damage assessment model for full CFS images, optimizing grading by considering topological features among detected stained regions, which are crucial for accurately interpreting the spatial properties of objects within an image. Accurate corneal localization, robust to variations in contrast, is first achieved by integrating CFS images' intensity and phase information, subsequently by a multi-scale morphological top-hat operator concerning their prior shape to detect the stained regions. Finally, a multi-scale graph structure is constructed based on the detected stained areas, and distance-weighted topological features, along with textural and morphological features, are extracted into an automatic grading model based on an ensemble model. Experiments on an in-house dataset of CFS images annotated with six categories of Ocular Surface Staining (OSS) scores reveal that incorporating topological features achieves the highest Accuracy (0.7589), F1 score (0.7449), and AUC (0.9335). Moreover, topological features outperformed other individual features. These findings underscore the effectiveness of our proposed model in CFS grading, indicating its potential for assessing corneal epithelial damage. Additionally, the valuable insights provided by topological features into the spatial distribution patterns of staining suggest promising applications for enhancing disease classification and supporting more informed clinical decision-making in managing dry eye conditions.","2025","Computers in biology and medicine"

However, health surveys and electronic health records (EHRs) frequently suffer from class imbalances, leading to prediction biases and differences between specificity and sensitivity, which hinder reliable model development despite the valuable insights contained in these datasets. To address this, we have introduced a novel approach to enhance MI risk prediction using self-reported attributes from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) and the National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) dataset. Our approach incorporates three innovative techniques: the Dual-Path Artificial Neural Network (DP-ANN) to mitigate biased decision making across imbalanced datasets, the Triple Criteria Selection (TCS) for unbiased feature selection, and Minority Weighted Sampling (MWS) to tackle challenges of uncontrolled minority class sampling. These methods collectively enhance MI prediction and feature relevance. The DP-ANN model has achieved balanced performance, with an average specificity of 80%, sensitivity of 82%, and AUC-ROC of 89.5%, improving imbalance variance by approximately 14.96% compared to prior studies. By outperforming other models across four heavily imbalanced datasets, our approach demonstrates robustness and generalizability. Additionally, SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis has revealed key predictors and risk factors for MI, such as coronary heart disease and bronchitis in females, and stroke among individuals aged 35-54. In conclusion, our study provides a robust model for healthcare professionals to assess MI risk through targeted factors, promoting early detection and potentially improving patient outcomes.","2025","Computers in biology and medicine"

DBScapillary progranulin levels in GRN mutation carriers (mean [SD] age, 55 [13] years; n = 16) were reduced compared to non-mutation carriers (64 [11] years; n = 44) (2.38 ng/mL [1.0] vs 4.37 [0.68] ng/mL; U = 42; p < 0.0001, ROC AUC = 0.94 [95% CI: 0.83 to 1.00]) and highly associated with venous plasma levels (R = 0.819; p < 0.001). Progranulin levels can be accurately determined from finger-stick blood samples. This can enable regular and remote monitoring of this protein in FTD therapeutic trials and potentially serve as a first-level screening test for GRN mutations. Progranulin levels measured using capillary dried blood spots were significantly reduced in GRN mutation carriers compared to non-mutation carriers. Progranulin levels measured using capillary dried blood spots strongly correlated with levels from venous EDTA plasma. DBScapillary progranulin levels were able to identify GRN mutation carriers with high accuracy. DBScapillary might allow repeated measurements of progranulin levels in a remote and unsupervised setting, circumventing the restrictions of traditional venous blood collection. DBScapillary might be used to assess the biological efficacy of disease-modifying therapies in clinical trials aiming to increase baseline progranulin levels or as a first-level screening for GRN mutations in primary settings.","2025","Alzheimer's & dementia : the journal of the Alzheimer's Association"
1255,"39614426","Deciphering potential molecular mechanisms in clear cell renal cell carcinoma based on the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 related genes: Identifying UBE2C correlates to infiltration of regulatory T cells.","Renal clear cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is a highly aggressive and common form of kidney cancer, with limited treatment options for advanced stages. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the ubiquitin-proteasome system in tumor progression, particularly the role of ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 (UBE2) family members. However, the prognostic significance of UBE2-related genes (UBE2RGs) in ccRCC remains unclear. In this study, bulk RNA-sequencing and single-cell RNA-sequencing data from ccRCC patients were retrieved from the Cancer Genome Atlas and Gene Expression Omnibus databases. Differential expression analysis was performed to identify UBE2RGs associated with ccRCC. A combination of 10 machine learning methods was applied to develop an optimal prognostic model, and its predictive performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC) values for 1-, 3-, and 5-year overall survival (OS) in both training and validation cohorts. Functional enrichment analyses of gene ontology and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes were conducted to explore the biological pathways involved. Correlation analysis was conducted to investigate the association between the risk score and tumor mutational burden (TMB) and immune cell infiltration. Immunotherapy and chemotherapy sensitivity were assessed by immunophenoscore and tumor immune, dysfunction, and exclusion scores to identify potential predictive significance. In vitro, knockdown of the key gene UBE2C in 786-O cells by specific small interfering RNA to validate its impact on apoptosis, migration, cell cycle, migration, invasion of tumor cells, and induction of regulatory T cells (Tregs). Analysis of sc-RNA revealed that UBE2 activity was significantly upregulated in malignant cells, suggesting its role in tumor progression. A three-gene prognostic model comprising UBE2C, UBE2D3, and UBE2T was constructed by Lasoo Cox regression and demonstrated robust predictive accuracy, with AUC values of 0.745, 0.766, and 0.771 for 1-, 3-, and 5-year survival, respectively. The model was validated as an independent prognostic factor in ccRCC. Patients in the high-risk group had a worse prognosis, higher TMB scores, and low responsiveness to immunotherapy. Additionally, immune infiltration and chemotherapy sensitivity analyses revealed that UBE2RGs are associated with various immune cells and drugs, suggesting that UBE2RGs could be a potential therapeutic target for ccRCC. In vitro experiments confirmed that the reduction of UBE2C led to an increase in apoptosis rate, as well as a decrease in tumor cell invasion and metastasis abilities. Additionally, si-UBE2C cells reduced the release of the cytokine Transforming Growth Factor-beta 1 (TGF-β1), leading to a decreased ratio of Tregs in the co-culture system. This study presents a novel three-gene prognostic model based on UBE2RGs that demonstrates significant predictive value for OS, immunotherapy, and chemotherapy in ccRCC patients. The findings underscore the potential of UBE2 family members as biomarkers and therapeutic targets in ccRCC, warranting further investigation in prospective clinical trials.","2025","BioFactors (Oxford, England)"

A total of 116 patients with stage IB (T2, ≤ 3 cm with VPI, N0, M0) NSCLC underwent tumor resection and F-18-FDG PET/CT 1-3 weeks before surgery and were followed up for 1-79 months after surgery. SUVpeak, SUVmax, SUVmean, MTV, and TLG of tumors were obtained. The primary and secondary endpoints were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS), respectively. ROC curve analysis, Cox regression test, and the Kaplan-Meier method were used for statistical analysis. High SUVs, TLG, and MTV were associated with postoperative progression of NSCLC (the area under the ROC curve: 0.695 to 0.750, P < .001). The increase of SUVs, TLG or MTV was associated with short postoperative PFS (P < .001) while an increase in TLG (P = .016) or MTV (P = .018) was associated with short postoperative OS. TLG > 16.81 was an independent indicator of both the short PFS (HR = 5.534, P = .002) and the short OS (HR = 5.075, P = .031). Further, adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with longer PFS in NSCLCs with TLG > 16.81 (treated vs. untreated: 63 vs. 52 months; HR = 2.242, P = .022) rather than those with TLG ≤ 16.81. SUV-based parameters on F-18-FDG PET/CT have the potential to evaluate the prognosis and benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy after tumor resection in stage IB (T2, ≤ 3 cm with VPI, N0, M0) NSCLC and therefore may be helpful for lung cancer treatment.","2025","Clinical lung cancer"

We aimed to identify a smaller combination of UCAPS behaviors that could be used as behavioral red flags for optimizing the acute pain diagnosis in cattle. We hypothesize that a specific set of UCAPS behaviors might be used as behavioral red flags for pain. This would represent a quick and simple pain evaluation and might optimize the acute pain assessment in large-scale systems. Data from two previous studies regarding UCAPS assessments before (pain free condition) and after (painful condition) surgical castration of 59 male cattle was used. We fitted a decision tree, resulting in a logic with two behaviors that we used as behavioral red flags. The logic adapted from the decision tree considered the painful diagnosis when the Activity was scored 2. When Activity was scored less than 2, but Locomotion was scored 1 or 2, the diagnosis was also considered positive for pain. When Activity was below 2 and Locomotion was 0, the diagnosis was considered free pain. Behavioral red flags had an area under the curve of 95.95 % for predicting UCAPS diagnosis and 94.13 % for predicting overall pain free and painful conditions. In conclusion, behaviors in the decision tree logic can work as behavioral red flags for optimizing the acute pain diagnosis in cattle, as a quick assessment in large-scale systems.","2025","Research in veterinary science"

A convenience sample of patients attending the respiratory and sleep clinic in the Northern Territory of Australia were included if they completed the GPSS prior to undergoing a diagnostic polysomnography. The GPSS contained 9 questions to provide information on: sex, age, body mass index, neck circumference, snoring, witnessed apnoeas, morning tiredness, daytime sleepiness and presence of hypertension/diabetes/heart disease/depression. Presence of OSA was defined as an apnoea-hypopnoea index of ≥15/hour. The GPSS scoring was developed via log odds of regression predictions for each GPSS question upon OSA. 159 patients (65 % male, median age 45 years) were enrolled. A minimum score of 1 was assigned to GPSS questions, up to 5 for the strongest predictor (neck circumference). The median total GPSS score was 13 (IQR 9, 16) (maximum 22) and correlated strongly with OSA (AUC 0.812 (95 % CI 0.744, 0.881)). Categorised into low (0-7), moderate (8-13) or high risk (>13), a moderate or severe score had sensitivity 100, specificity 34.9 %. The GPSS significantly outperformed the Epworth Sleepiness Scale, Berlin questionnaire and OSA-50, and was comparable but slightly improved against the STOP-Bang. The proposed GPSS tool could be of use in general practice settings. Further prospective research is warranted to test the applicability and adaptability of the GPSS tool in wider population settings.","2025","Sleep medicine"
1259,"39612691","Computer-assisted diagnosis for axillary lymph node metastasis of early breast cancer based on transformer with dual-modal adaptive mid-term fusion using ultrasound elastography.","Accurate preoperative qualitative assessment of axillary lymph node metastasis (ALNM) in early breast cancer patients is crucial for precise clinical staging and selection of axillary treatment strategies. Although previous studies have introduced artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the assessment performance of ALNM, they all focus on the prediction performances of their AI models and neglect the clinical assistance to the radiologists, which brings some issues to the clinical practice. To this end, we propose a human-AI collaboration strategy for ALNM diagnosis of early breast cancer, in which a novel deep learning framework, termed DAMF-former, is designed to assist radiologists in evaluating ALNM. Specifically, the DAMF-former focuses on the axillary region rather than the primary tumor area in previous studies. To mimic the radiologists' alternative integration of the UE images of the target axillary lymph nodes for comprehensive analysis, adaptive mid-term fusion is proposed to alternatively extract and adaptively fuse the high-level features from the dual-modal UE images (i.e., B-mode ultrasound and Shear Wave Elastography). To further improve the diagnostic outcome of the DAMF-former, an adaptive Youden index scheme is proposed to deal with the fully fused dual-modal UE image features at the end of the framework, which can balance the diagnostic performance in terms of sensitivity and specificity. The clinical experiment indicates that the designed DAMF-former can assist and improve the diagnostic abilities of less-experienced radiologists for ALNM. Especially, the junior radiologists can significantly improve the diagnostic outcome from 0.807 AUC [95% CI: 0.781, 0.830] to 0.883 AUC [95% CI: 0.861, 0.902] (P-value <0.0001). Moreover, there are great agreements among radiologists of different levels when assisted by the DAMF-former (Kappa value ranging from 0.805 to 0.895; P-value <0.0001), suggesting that less-experienced radiologists can potentially achieve a diagnostic level similar to that of experienced radiologists through human-AI collaboration.

The suitability of screening tools for detecting OSA in memory clinic settings is unclear. To evaluate the utility and validity of the STOP-Bang questionnaire (SBQ) and pulse oximeter as a screening tool, compared to gold-standard polysomnography (PSG) in older adults attending a memory clinic. Participants aged over 50 with new onset cognitive/mood concerns attended a memory clinic, then completed the SBQ, oximetry, and PSG. The SBQ and oximetry's accuracy in detecting moderate-severe and severe OSA was evaluated using receiver operating curves. Intraclass correlation and Bland-Altman plots compared the oximeter's adjusted oxygen desaturation index (ODI-Ox) and PSG's apnea-hypopnea index (AHI-PSG). Of 194 participants (mean age = 65.6, 64 males) who completed PSG, 184 completed the SBQ, and 138 completed oximetry. SBQ demonstrated limited performance for moderate-severe OSA (sensitivity = 52%, specificity = 62%, AUC = 0.600) and severe OSA (sensitivity = 18%, specificity = 87%, AUC = 0.577). Oximetry was satisfactory for moderate-severe OSA (sensitivity = 67%, specificity = 73%, AUC = 0.769) and severe OSA (sensitivity = 50%, specificity = 88%, AUC = 0.730). The diagnostic performance was improved with new cut-offs at ODI-Ox ≥ 11 for AHI-PSG ≥ 15 and ODI-Ox ≥ 20 for AHI-PSG ≥ 30. Bland-Altman plots and intraclass correlation indicated acceptable agreement for oximetry. The findings suggest that while the SBQ may be unsuitable to detect moderate or severe OSA for older adults with cognitive impairment, oximetry may be a viable screening tool. Given OSA treatment can optimize sleep and may slow cognitive decline, routine screening for OSA should be part of memory clinic assessments.","2025","Journal of Alzheimer's disease : JAD"

Presently, obstetricians and midwives primarily rely on visual interpretation, leading to a significant intra-observer variability. In this paper, we build and evaluate a convolutional neural network to detect neonatal acidemia from the CTG signals during delivery on a multicenter database with 27662 cases in five centers, including 3457 and 464 cases of moderate and severe neonatal acidemia respectively (defined by a fetal pH at birth between 7.05 and 7.20, and lower than 7.05 respectively). To use all the available records, the convolutional layers are pretrained on a task which consists in predicting several features known to be associated with neonatal acidemia from the raw CTG signals. In a cross-center evaluation, the AUC varies from 0.74 to 0.83 between the centers for the detection of severe acidemia, showing the ability of deep learning models to generalize from one dataset to the other and paving the way for more accurate models trained on larger databases. The model can still be significantly improved, by adding clinical variables to account for risk factors of acidemia that may not appear in the CTG signals. Further research will also be led to integrate the model in a tool that could assist humans in the interpretation of CTG.","2025","Computers in biology and medicine"

Indeed, delay in the short interval between pronuclear breakdown (PNBD) and the first cytokinesis may result in chromosome segregation errors. We tested the hypothesis that delays in this final phase of fertilization are associated with a detrimental impact on embryo development. This is a retrospective study of 1315 zygotes cultured using time lapse technologies generated in 205 first ICSI-cycles. We observed an association between increasing times of the pronuclear fading-first cleavage interval (t2-tPNf) and the rates of trichotomous/direct unequal cleavage at the first (DUC-1) and second (DUC-2) mitotic cycle. Moreover, we observed a reduced blastulation rate. No significant associations were observed between rates of direct unequal cleavage at the third mitotic cycle (DUC-3) and top-quality blastocysts, euploidy, and live births. To evaluate whether the interval t2-tPNf could have a predictive value for the onset of DUC-1 and DUC-2, ROC curve analyses were performed. The area under the curve values obtained for DUC-1 showed a significant prediction accuracy. The best cut-offs to identify zygotes with a high risk of DUC-1 and DUC-2 occurrence were t2-tPNf > 2.78 (hours) and t2-tPNf > 2.50 (hours), respectively. Delay in the short interval between PNBD and the first cytokinesis result in trichotomous cleavage and early developmental arrest. However, if the embryos reach the blastocyst stage, rates of euploidy and live birth do not appear to be compromised.","2025","Journal of assisted reproduction and genetics"

In this prospective exploratory cohort study pregnant women between 24 and 40 gestational weeks with preterm delivery (n = 16), preeclampsia (n = 19), and matched term delivery controls (n = 15) were recruited from Bnai Zion Medical Center, Haifa, Israel. Plasma samples were tested using a multiple microarray analyzer. Glass slides with 17 antibodies against EV surface receptors - were incubated with raw plasma samples, detected by biotinylated secondary antibodies specific to EVs or placental EVs (PEVs), and labeled with cyanine 5-streptavidin. PBS and whole human IgG served as controls. The fluorescent signal ratio to negative controls was log 2 transformed and analyzed for sensitivity and specificity using the area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUROC). Best pair ratios of general EVs/PEVs were used for univariate analysis, and top pairs were combined for multivariate analysis. Results were validated by comparison with EVs purified using standard procedures. Heatmaps differentiated surface profiles of preeclampsia, preterm delivery, and term delivery receptors on total EVs and PEVs. Similar results were obtained with enriched EVs and EVs from raw plasma. Univariate analyses identified markers predicting preterm delivery and preeclampsia over term delivery controls with AUC >0.6 and sensitivity >50% at 80% specificity. Combining the best markers in a multivariate model, preeclampsia prediction over term delivery had an AUC of 0.89 (95% CI: 0.72-1.0) with 90% sensitivity and 90% specificity, marked by inflammation (TNF RII), relaxation (placenta protein 13 (PP13)), and immune-modulation (LFA1) receptors.

Differentially expressed gene (DEG) analyses were performed using DESeq2. Gene set enrichment, correlation, and cell deconvolution analyses were applied to identify modules and functionally enriched transcriptional signatures of CD. A comparison of CD patients and non-CD controls revealed that of the 372 DEGs, 49 protein-coding genes and 5 long non-coding RNAs overlapped with the inflammatory bowel disease susceptibility loci. The pathways related to immune and inflammatory reactions were upregulated in CD, while metabolic pathways were downregulated in CD. Compared with non-CD controls, CD patients had significantly higher proportions of immune cells, including plasma cells (P = 1.15 × 10-4), and a lower proportion of epithelial cells (P = 1.12 × 10-4). Co-upregulated genes (M14 module) and co-downregulated genes (M9 module) were identified in CD patients. The M14 module was enriched in immune-related genes and significantly associated with the responses to anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy. The core signature of the M14 module was comprised of six genes and was upregulated in nonresponders to anti-TNF therapy of five independent cohorts (n = 163), indicating acceptable discrimination ability (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 75-86%).

Transforming acidic coiled-coil protein-3 (TACC3) has been identified as a critical factor in tumor progression and immune infiltration across cancers, including NSCLC. Predicting TACC3 expression through radiomic features may provide valuable insights into tumor biology and aid clinical decision-making. However, its predictive value in NSCLC remains unexplored. Therefore, we aimed to construct and validate a radiomic model to predict TACC3 levels and prognosis in patients with NSCLC. Genomic data and contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) images were sourced from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, and The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). A total of 320 cases of lung adenocarcinoma from TCGA and 122 cases of NSCLC from GEO were used for prognostic analysis. Sixty-three cases from TCIA and GEO were included for radiomics feature extraction and model development. The radiomics model was constructed using logistic regression (LR) and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. We predicted TACC3 expression and evaluated its correlation with NSCLC prognosis using contrast-enhanced CT-based radiomics. TACC3 expression significantly influenced NSCLC prognosis. High TACC3 levels were associated with reduced overall survival, potentially mediated by immune microenvironment and tumor progression regulation. LR and SVM algorithms achieved AUC of 0.719 and 0.724, respectively, which remained at 0.701 and 0.717 after five-fold cross-validation. Contrast-enhanced CT-based radiomics can non-invasively predict TACC3 expression and provide valuable prognostic information, contributing to personalized treatment strategies.","2025","Translational oncology"

Consequently, schizophrenia patients form distinct subphenotypes of schizophrenia, with specific symptom patterns and outcomes. This study included 4257 adults, with long-term schizophrenia (control - 8955 individuals) who were assessed for schizophrenia with potentially severe outcomes based on following criteria: disability in functional and/or physical domains before the age of 40; severe negative symptoms (present in infancy or shortly after onset); a continuous course of the disease. Additionally, the time of the onset and aggressive/antisocial tendencies were assessed as one the predictors of potentially severe outcomes. A total of 817 participants met at least three of these criteria, i.e., had disruptive schizophrenia. A genome-wide and transcriptome-wide association study was conducted using linear regression and the PrediXcan algorithm. The obtained data were used to develop a polygenic risk model for early risk prediction of schizophrenia with potentially severe outcomes. Significant associations were found between schizophrenia and variants in CAMTA1, TRHDE, NELFE, and others. The PRS model demonstrated high performance in training, internal and external validation (ROC AUC of 0.9, 0.89, and 0.68, respectively). The functional pathway analysis highlighted pathways involved in ATP metabolism, myeloid cell differentiation, and apoptotic processes. Subphenotyping schizophrenia may enhance the discovery of genetic factors affecting its development and progression. The GWAS and TWAS findings revealed general mechanisms involved in the development of schizophrenia with potentially severe outcomes, such as synapse regulation, inflammation, and apoptosis.","2025","Journal of psychiatric research"

The study sample comprised 76 patients (152 joints) who underwent MRI and CT examinations to diagnose TMJ disorders. Two specialists in oral and maxillofacial radiology assessed the bony changes of the TMJ on FRACTURE, proton density-weighted (PDw), and fat-suppression T2-weighted (T2wFS) sequences. Receiver operating characteristic curves were plotted for each sequence, and the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated. Additionally, the interobserver agreement (Cohen's kappa value) and sensitivity in assessing each osteoarthritis finding were calculated for each sequence. The FRACTURE sequence had the highest diagnostic performance, with an accuracy of 0.85, sensitivity of 0.85, specificity of 0.84, and AUC of 0.84. These values were 0.84, 0.72, 0.91, and 0.80, respectively, for the PDw sequence, and 0.83, 0.72, 0.91, and 0.79, respectively, for the T2wFS sequence. The AUC did not significantly differ between the FRACTURE and PDw sequences (Delong test, P > .05), but did significantly differ between the FRACTURE and T2wFS sequences (P < .05). For all osteoarthritis findings, the FRACTURE sequence had the highest kappa values and the highest sensitivity. FRACTURE sequencing may be a promising tool for the diagnosis of TMJ osteoarthritis compared with other conventional sequences.","2025","Dento maxillo facial radiology"

This retrospective cohort study included 180 TMJs from 90 patients with TMJ signs and symptoms. A radiomics platform was used to extract imaging features of disc displacements. Thereafter, different machine learning algorithms and logistic regression were implemented on radiomics features for feature selection, classification, and prediction. The radiomics features included first-order statistics, size- and shape-based features, and texture features. Six classifiers, including logistic regression, random forest, decision tree, k-nearest neighbours (KNN), XGBoost, and support vector machine were used for a model building which could predict the TMJ disc displacements. The performance of models was evaluated by sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curve. KNN classifier was found to be the most optimal machine learning model for prediction of TMJ disc displacements. The AUC, sensitivity, and specificity for the training set were 0.944, 0.771, 0.918 for normal, anterior disc displacement with reduction (ADDwR) and anterior disc displacement without reduction (ADDwoR) while testing set were 0.913, 0.716, and 1 for normal, ADDwR, and ADDwoR. For TMJ disc displacements, skewness, root mean squared, kurtosis, minimum, large area low grey level emphasis, grey level non-uniformity, and long-run high grey level emphasis, were selected as optimal features.

Univariate analysis a t-test, Mann-Whitney U test, or Fisher's exact test and multivariate logistic regression were performed to assess patient characteristics and clinicopathological variables between survivors and nonsurvivors. The short-term mortality rate was 12.0% (95% confidence interval [CI], 6.6%-19.7%). Univariate analysis identified plasma lactate dehydrogenase activity (LDH; P < .001) and bilirubin concentration (P = .001) as being significantly increased in nonsurvivors, whereas concentrations of albumin (P = .003), total protein (P = .03), sodium (P = .005), and potassium (P = .005) were significantly lower. Additionally, nonsurvivors were significantly less likely to be febrile (≥39.4°C; P = .006). Of these variables, only plasma LDH activity ≥323 U/L, a cut-point determined by receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, was significantly associated with short-term mortality by multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 15.30; 95% CI, 1.18-198.00; P = .04).

This study aimed to develop the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based radiomics models to predict rectal cancer recurrence in CEA-negative patients. This retrospective multicenter study consecutively enrolled rectal cancer patients with negative pretreatment CEA diagnosed between November 2012 and November 2018 from three medical centers. Radiomics features were extracted from the volume of interest on T2-weighted and diffusion-weighted images. Inter-class correlation coefficient (ICC) analysis, univariate Cox and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) Cox regression were then used to select features and construct a radiomics signature (RS). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was applied to develop two prediction models for disease-free survival (DFS) by incorporating the RS and independent clinicopathological predictors. The Kaplan-Meier method stratified tumor recurrence risk, and model performance was assessed using the Harrell concordance index (C-index). A total of 600 rectal cancer patients were assigned to the development cohort (n = 358), internal test cohort (n = 120) and external test cohort (n = 122). The combination of ICC, univariate and LASSO Cox regression resulted in the selection of 25 radiomics features that comprise the RS. The RS can significantly stratify high-risk and low-risk patients (development: HR = 6.63, internal test: HR = 4.76, external test: HR = 4.62, all p < 0.05) and achieved good predictive performance (C-index = 0.720-0.758).

However, the choice of the most appropriate normalization method in stroke studies remains unclear, as demonstrated by inconsistent findings in the literature. Here, we propose a regression- and single-subject-based model for analyzing FDG-PET images without intensity normalization. Two independent data sets were collected before and after middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO), with one comprising 120 rats and the other 96 rats. After data preprocessing, voxel intensities in the same region and hemisphere were paired before and after the MCAO scan. A linear regression model was applied to the paired data, and the coefficient of determination R2 was calculated to measure the linearity. The R2 values between the ipsilateral and contralateral hemispheres were compared, and significant regions were defined as those with reduced linearity. Our method was compared with voxel-wise analysis under different intensity normalization methods and validated using the triphenyl tetrazolium chloride (TTC) staining data. The significant regions identified by the proposed method showed a large degree of overlap with the infarcted regions identified by TTC data, as measured by the Dice similarity coefficient (DSC). The average DSC of the proposed method was 59.7%, whereas the DSCs of the existing approaches ranged from 41.4%∼51.3%. Additional validation using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) demonstrated that the area under the curve (AUC) of the average ROC curves reached 0.84 using the proposed method, whereas existing methods achieved AUCs ranging from 0.77∼0.79. The identified regions were consistent across the two independent data sets, and some findings were corroborated by other publications. The proposed model presents a novel quantitative approach for identifying injury regions post-stroke using FDG-PET images. The calculation does not require intensity normalization and can be applied to individual subjects. The method yields more sensitive results compared to existing identification methods.","2025","Computers in biology and medicine"

Currently, specific markers for the accurate diagnosis and prediction of psoriatic disease are lacking. Here, we employed a three-step designed study to perform untargeted metabolomics, with the aim of identifying candidate biomarkers for psoriasis. Through comprehensive multivariate and univariate statistical analyses, we screened eight potential biomarkers specific to psoriasis, with five structurally identified. Two dipeptide biomarkers, γ-GluSer and ThrGly, along with a lysine glycation metabolite, Nα-fructosyl-lysine (Fruc-Lys), were found to be psoriasis biomarkers for the first time. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis revealed that the area under the curve (AUC) values of these eight metabolites/features ranged from 0.68 to 0.94. A biomarker panel comprising ThrGly and feature m/z 120.0656 (C4H9NO3) demonstrated high diagnostic accuracy (AUC = 0.97) in distinguishing psoriasis patients from healthy controls.

Second, to compare the predictive performance of EFW at 36 weeks' gestation for SGA vs fetal growth restriction (FGR) at birth. Third, to compare the predictive performance for delivery of a SGA neonate of EFW < 10th percentile vs a model combining maternal demographic characteristics and elements of medical history with EFW. This was a retrospective analysis of prospectively collected data in 21 676 women with a singleton pregnancy who had undergone routine ultrasound examination at 31 + 0 to 33 + 6 weeks' gestation and 107 875 women with a singleton pregnancy who had undergone routine ultrasound examination at 35 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks. Measurements of fetal head circumference, abdominal circumference and femur length were used to calculate EFW according to the Hadlock formula and this was expressed as a percentile according to the Fetal Medicine Foundation fetal and neonatal population weight charts. The same charts were used to diagnose SGA neonates with birth weight < 10th or < 3rd percentile. FGR was defined as birth weight < 10th percentile in addition to Doppler anomalies. For each gestational-age window at screening, the screen-positive rate and detection rate were calculated at different EFW cut-offs between the 10th and 50th percentiles for predicting the delivery of a SGA neonate with birth weight < 10th or < 3rd percentile, either within 2 weeks or at any time after assessment. The areas under the receiver-operating-characteristics curves (AUC) of screening for a SGA neonate by EFW at 31 + 0 to 33 + 6 weeks and at 35 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks were compared. The predictive performance of routine ultrasonographic examination during the third trimester for delivery of a SGA neonate is higher if: first, the scan is carried out at 35 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks' gestation rather than at 31 + 0 to 33 + 6 weeks; second, the outcome measure is birth weight < 3rd rather than < 10th percentile; third, the outcome measure is FGR rather than SGA; fourth, if delivery occurs within 2 weeks after assessment rather than at any time after assessment; and fifth, prediction is performed using a model that combines maternal demographic characteristics and elements of medical history with EFW rather than EFW < 10th percentile alone. At 35 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks' gestation, detection of ≥ 85% of SGA neonates with birth weight < 10th percentile born at any time after assessment necessitates the use of EFW < 40th percentile. Screening at this percentile cut-off predicted 95% and 98% of neonates with birth weight < 10th and < 3rd percentile, respectively, born within 2 weeks after assessment, and the respective values for neonates born at any time after assessment were 85% and 93%. Routine third-trimester ultrasonographic screening for a SGA neonate performs best when the scan is carried out at 35 + 0 to 36 + 6 weeks' gestation, rather than at 31 + 0 to 33 + 6 weeks, and when EFW is combined with maternal risk factors to estimate the patient-specific risk. © 2024 The Author(s).

Latino adolescents have increased MASLD and fibrosis risk. While fibrosis is diagnosed by biopsy or imaging, more accessible, noninvasive, and economical screening methods are needed. We aimed to use plasma metabolomics/lipidomics to identify potential fibrosis biomarkers in Latino adolescents with obesity. Liver stiffness (LS) was measured in 93 Latino adolescents with obesity using magnetic resonance elastography. Metabolites and lipids were extracted from plasma and identified on Compound Discoverer. Associations between metabolites/lipids and fibrosis (LS > 2.73 kPa) were determined using linear regression models after covariate adjustment. False discovery rate (FDR) adjusted Pearson's correlations were performed. Analytes yielding significant FDR-adjusted correlations were examined further by receiver operator curve analysis. Mean (±standard deviation) alanine transaminase (ALT) was 45.7(±65.2) IU/L, hepatic fat fraction was 12.7(±9.1)%, and LS was 2.4(±0.3) kPa. We identified 795 metabolites and 413 lipids in plasma, but only one single metabolite, dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), a marker of triglyceride synthesis, was significantly associated with fibrosis after FDR adjustment (p < 0.05). In terms of predicting fibrosis, ALT had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.79, and DHAP had an AUC of 0.79. When combined, ALT + DHAP had an AUC of 0.89. The combination of ALT + DHAP may have the potential as an accurate, noninvasive test for liver fibrosis.

Hence, there is an increasing interest in angiography-derived indices to encourage assessment of CMD in the cardiac catheterisation laboratory. We investigate here an alternative approach, using a combination of pressure-wire-based assessment of distal coronary pressure (Pd) and an angiography-derived surrogate of coronary flow, to derive a hybrid index of microcirculatory resistance (IMRhybrid). Patients enroled prospectively under the Oxford Acute Myocardial Infarction (OxAMI) study were included in the OxAMI HYBRID substudy. The accuracy of IMRhybrid was assessed in diagnosing CMD using bolus thermodilution-based Index of Microcirculatory Resistance (IMR) as a reference. The accuracy of IMRhybrid was then compared against a fully angiography-derived index of microvascular resistance (IMRangio). One hundred and eighty six patients were enroled, of which 121 with acute coronary syndrome and 65 with stable coronary artery disease. A total of 240 vessel analyses were performed. Both IMRhybrid and IMRangio correlated with IMR (rho = 0.71, p < 0.001 and rho = 0.71, p < 0.001 respectively) and showed good and comparable overall diagnostic accuracy in predicting IMR ≥ 25 (80.8% and 83.1% respectively) with a receiver operator curve (ROC) analyses showing similar AUC of 0.86 (95% CI 0.82-0.91, p < 0.001) for IMRhybrid and 0.86 (95% CI 0.809-0.906, p < 0.001) for IMRangio, p for comparison = 0.641. Both approaches, IMRhybrid and IMRangio are viable and comparable indices correlating with bolus thermodilution-based IMR and retaining good diagnostic accuracy.

To evaluate the occurrence rate of perioperative complications in various surgical domains, the E-PASS (Estimation of Physiological Ability and Surgical Stress) score is employed. This study was carried out to investigate the utility of the E-PASS score as a predictive factor for the risk of minor complications in patients undergoing CEA. The retrospective analysis was performed for 104 consecutive series of CEA procedures carried out at Otaru Municipal Hospital. The correlation between E-PASS and the rate of minor complications was examined. Sensitivity and specificity were used to construct a receiver operating characteristic curve, and the area under the curve (AUC) was calculated for accuracy. Postoperative minor complications occurred in eight cases (7.7%), including six vagal nerve injuries and two pneumonia cases. Three categorical data-preoperative risk score, surgical stress scores, and comprehensive risk score (CRS) -showed a good relationship with the postoperative minor complication. Among them, CRS presented the highest sensitivity and specificity, as indicated by an AUC of 0.68. The CRS cutoff value was calculated as -0.068, with a 1.7% postoperative minor complication rate for those lower than -0.068 and 14.0% for those higher than -0.068.

Variables with significant differences were included in multivariate logistic regression (LR) analysis. A decision model was built and simplified based on importance ranking of variables. K-nearest-neighbor (KNN) model was introduced to learn distribution of individuals in main dimensions based on multiple correspondence analysis (MCA) and predicted diagnosis. The diagnostic efficacy of the classification system and the KNN model was compared. Significant differences existed in Dmax-IVC angle, septation, mural nodule, upstream and downstream biliary dilatation, communication with bile duct between MCN and cystic IPNB. Downstream biliary dilatation and communication with bile duct were highly specific for IPNB (specificity, 97.9 % and 100 %, respectively), which could independently diagnose IPNB. Among four significant indicators in LR analysis, upstream biliary dilatation and Dmax-IVC angle were used for a simplified decision model to attain good applicability.

The scRNA-seq data analysis, IHC and Elisa were employed to validate the expression of the biomarker in the serum and tissues of clinical patients across different pathological stages. MUC17 has been identified as a non-invasive diagnostic marker for GIN. It is upregulated in GIN prior to the onset of gastric carcinogenesis and downregulated in other tumors, with high GC specificity. The area under the curve values of serum MUC17 for differentiating chronic gastritis (CG) from low-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (LGIN), high-grade intraepithelial neoplasia (HGIN), and early gastric cancer (EGC) were 0.8788, 0.8544, and 0.9513, respectively. Additionally, low plasma MUC17 levels were found to be significantly lower in gastric ulcer (GU), gastric neuroendocrine tumor (GNET), and gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) compared to GIN. The AUC for differentiating between GIN and GU, GNET, or GIST was 0.7803, 0.9244 and 0.9796, respectively.

An explainable AI (XAI) model was developed to analyze 1598 endoscopic images from 287 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with a focus on detecting EBV infection. Following the application of data augmentation and transfer learning techniques, the model accurately classified the presence of EBV, and its performance was quantified through receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, including calculation of the area under the curve (AUC). Furthermore, a combination of the Grad-CAM method and clinical data analysis significantly improved the interpretability and diagnostic accuracy of the model. Our model significantly outperformed other models, including those developed with ResNet50, Vision Transformer (ViT), and MobileNet v2 architectures, in detecting EBV on endoscopic images, achieving an accuracy of 73.83 % and an F1-score of 73.70 %. The model showed good performance in distinguishing between EBV-positive and EBV-negative images according to the confusion matrix and ROC curve analysis, with metrics including a true negative rate of 79.76 %, a true positive rate of 67.32 %, and an AUC of 0.74. Additionally, the generated salience maps effectively identified key regions in the images, enhancing lesion detection in patients with EBV infection. Our correlational analysis revealed significant associations between EBV infection and clinical parameters such as age, illness duration, and total bilirubin, and suggested that EBV infection had a notably greater incidence in ulcerative colitis (UC) patients than in Crohn's disease (CD) patients.

Univariate analysis identified several features significantly associated with complicated appendicitis: age (P < 0.001), gender (P = 0.006), time from symptom onset to diagnosis (P = 0.015), CRP level (P < 0.001), fascial involvement score (P < 0.001), appendiceal diameter (P < 0.001), and the presence of extraluminal air (P < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that the fascial involvement score (odds ratio 2.252; P < 0.001) and appendiceal diameter (odds ratio 1.263; P < 0.001) were independent risk factors for complicated appendicitis. The fascial involvement score demonstrated an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.896, with a cutoff value of 2.5. Both the fascial involvement score and an appendiceal diameter of 14.5 mm or greater are independent predictors of complicated appendicitis.","2025","European journal of radiology"

This study introduced GAPPA, a novel GNN-based approach, to predict post-ADX outcomes in patients with unilateral primary aldosteronism (UPA). The objective was to leverage the intricate dependencies between clinico-biochemical features and clinical outcomes using GNNs integrated into a bipartite graph structure to enhance prognostic prediction accuracy. We conceptualized prognostic prediction as a link prediction task on a bipartite graph, with nodes representing patients, clinico-biochemical features, and clinical outcomes, and edges denoting the connections between them. GAPPA utilizes GNNs to capture these dependencies and seamlessly integrates the outcome predictions into a graph structure. This approach was evaluated using a dataset of 640 patients with UPA who underwent unilateral ADX (uADX) between 1990 and 2022. We conducted a comparative analysis using repeated stratified five-fold cross-validation and paired t-tests to evaluate the performance of GAPPA against conventional machine learning methods and previous studies across various metrics. GAPPA significantly outperformed conventional machine learning methods and previous studies (p < 0.05) across various metrics. It achieved F1-score, accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 71.3 % ± 3.1 %, 71.1 % ± 3.4 %, 69.9 % ± 4.3 %, and 72.4 % ± 7.2 %, respectively, with an AUC of 0.775 ± 0.030. We also investigated the impact of different initialization schemes on GAPPA outcome-edge embeddings, highlighting their robustness and stability. GAPPA aids in preoperative prognosis assessment and facilitates patient counseling, contributing to prognostic prediction and advancing the applications of GNNs in the biomedical domain.","2025","Artificial intelligence in medicine"
1288,"39577512","Robust feature learning using contractive autoencoders for multi-omics clustering in cancer subtyping.","Cancer can manifest in virtually any tissue or organ, necessitating precise subtyping of cancer patients to enhance diagnosis, treatment, and prognosis. With the accumulation of vast amounts of omics data, numerous studies have focused on integrating multi-omics data for cancer subtyping using clustering techniques. However, due to the heterogeneity of different omics data, extracting important features to effectively integrate these data for accurate clustering analysis remains a significant challenge. This study proposes a new multi-omics clustering framework for cancer subtyping, which utilizes contractive autoencoder to extract robust features. By encouraging the learned representation to be less sensitive to small changes, the contractive autoencoder learns robust feature representations from different omics. To incorporate survival information into the clustering analysis, Cox proportional hazards regression is used to further select the key features significantly associated with survival for integration. Finally, we utilize K-means clustering on the integrated feature to obtain the clustering result. The proposed framework is evaluated on ten different cancer datasets across four levels of omics data and compared to other existing methods. The experimental results indicate that the proposed framework effectively integrates the four omics datasets and outperforms other methods, achieving higher C-index scores and showing more significant differences between survival curves. Additionally, differential gene analysis and pathway enrichment analysis are performed to further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method framework.","2025","Methods (San Diego, Calif.)"

Revascularization using primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is the gold standard treatment. Despite the restoration of myocardial blood flow, some patients experience adverse outcomes. Early detection of high-risk patients would facilitate timely management, potentially improving their morbidity, mortality, and quality of life. In-depth characterization of the aortic pressure (AP) waveform may identify a high-risk patient cohort. We present tree-based classifiers and features extracted from the AP signals to identify patients at risk of adverse outcomes. This is a single-center, retrospective cohort study that included 605 eligible STEMI patients [64.2 ± 13.2 years, 71.4 % (432) males] treated with PPCI. Outcomes, including mortality (within 30-day and 1-year), and in-hospital events such as prolonged in-hospital stay (>4 days) for medical reasons, a new diagnosis of heart failure (HF), diuretic use for more than 24 h, intubation-ventilation or BiPAP use, and inotropic and/or vasopressor use, were recorded. We extracted features mainly from denoised AP signals recorded during PPCI, followed by different feature selection algorithms and classification methods to predict outcomes. Various classifiers such as tree-based classifiers, including random forest (RF), adaptive boosting (AdaBoost), extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and CatBoost, were used. Using recursive feature elimination (RFE) as the feature selection method and the CatBoost classifier, we achieved a receiver operating characteristic curve's area under the curve (AUC) of 80 % for all outcomes except for the new diagnosis of HF and diuretic use (>24 h). For the new diagnosis of HF and diuretic use (>24 h), the AUC values were 73 % and 79 %, respectively.

Both clinical and laboratory markers are often non- specific, and a blood culture contaminant may confuse management of the infant. This study aims to use an existing, inexpensive test, the neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR), to predict culture positivity and thus optimise antibiotic management. Data on infants born ≤32 weeks gestation from 2015 to 2020 who were treated for sepsis were analyzed. Episodes were categorised based on culture positivity: i) positive with known pathogens, ii) true positive with coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), iii) false positive with CoNS contaminants, iv) positive with other contaminants, and v) negative culture. NLR was compared with late C-reactive protein (CRP) and immature-to-total neutrophil ratio (ITR). Receiver operating curve (ROC) analysis was performed in this study. A cut- off value of 1.2 was chosen for NLR to detect culture. A total of 2024 infants were included in the study, with no significant differences in demographics between groups. Infants with positive blood cultures of known pathogens had higher median NLR of 1.44 compared with those with contaminants (0.75) or negative cultures (0.84). A NLR cut-off value of 1.2 gave a sensitivity of 65.7 % and specificity of 63.7 %.The area under the curve (AUC) for NLR, late CRP and ITR were 0.71, 0.64 and 0.57 respectively. Combining NLR with late CRP would increase the AUC to 0.78 (95 % C·I 0.75-0.82, p < 0.01), whereas the addition of ITR to NLR and late CRP would not improve this. In a secondary analysis, between true and contaminant CoNS positivity, NLR and ITR could not be used to differentiate between these groups (p < 0.05 and 0.33), but late CRP could (p < 0.01). Clinicians should consider the use of NLR as an adjunct biomarker to late CRP in detecting culture positive sepsis in premature neonates. The use of ITR does not improve diagnostic accuracy for sepsis.","2025","Early human development"

The impact of loneliness status on AF recurrence remains unclear. We conducted a cohort study based on patients with AF undergoing catheter ablation from 2017 to 2022. The Chinese version of the De Jong Gierveld scale (DJGLS) for evaluating loneliness degree was used. Multivariate Cox regression was performed to identify the independent risk factors for recurrent AF. A multivariate model was used to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) when adjusting the known risk covariates in several kinds of subgroups. Nine hundred fifty-five patients with AF and mean age > 65 years finished long-term follow-up. The AF cluster with severe/extreme loneliness tended to live alone according to DJGLS scores. Multivariate Cox regression showed that loneliness status is an independent risk factor for AF recurrence by using a multivariate model with adjustments of some covariates (moderate loneliness: HR 2.02; 95% CI 1.47-2.77, P < 0.001; severe/extreme loneliness: HR 5.28; 95% CI 3.56-7.84, P < 0.001). Survival analysis demonstrated that patients with AF with a more severe degree of loneliness are more likely to have AF recurrence in the long-term follow-up (log-rank test, P < 0.001). Restricted cubic spline (RCS) showed a mainly non-linear relationship between feeling lonely and AF recurrence (P overall < 0.001, P non-linear = 0.195). Receiver-operator characteristic curve (ROC) and time-dependent ROC curve indicated that the diagnostic value of loneliness status in predicting AF recurrence is stable and acceptable. A more severe degree of loneliness was positively associated with increased risk of AF recurrence. Loneliness status showed an acceptable diagnostic value in discriminating AF recurrence as an independent tripartite variable.","2025","Advances in therapy"

Activity tracker offers the potential to collect a broad range of patient-generated data to supplement the assessment of PS. Patients with metastatic NSCLC (mNSCLC) participated in a single institute, prospective, observational feasibility study conducted at Huntsman Cancer Institute. Patients were given a Fitbit® activity tracker, which collects their steps taken, distance moved, heart rate, and activity intensity. At baseline, PS was assessed by physicians and patients, and demographics and clinical data were collected. We defined novel indices of health: Heart rate Activity zone Mismatch (HAM) and excessive Sedentary Heart Rate (eSHR). We used multivariable Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, sex, and treatment line to estimate and test the prognostic ability of clinical and fitness metrics on overall survival (OS). Each prognostic model was evaluated using Harrell's concordance index (C-index). Fifty-five patients with mNSCLC were enrolled. The median OS was 10.4 months (95% CI: 7.2, 15.2). PS-physician (HR = 2.0; P < .001) and Fitbit metrics were associated with OS, including daily total steps (1,000-steps) (HR = 0.8; P = .004), HAM (HR = 2; P = .02), eSHR (HR = 0.3; P = .001). The prognostic model that includes PS-physician was associated with the best concordance (C-index = 0.75), followed by daily total distance (C-index = 0.74) and steps (C-index = 0.73) CONCLUSIONS: Tracker-based measures were prognostic of survival in mNSCLC and may be useful as a supplement or alternative to PS in practice and clinical trials.","2025","Clinical lung cancer"

A decreased 6-min walk distance (6MWD) and exercise-induced oxygen desaturation measured during the 6-min walk test (6MWT), are known predictors of mortality in patients with IPF. However, the use of antifibrotic drugs showed a survival benefit in IPF. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate to what extend 6MWT-derived attributes are associated with two-year survival when antifibrotic drugs were introduced as part of standard IPF-care. This real-world data-study included patients with IPF with a 6MWT between 2015 and 2020, and used composite outcome: mortality or lung transplantation within 2 years of follow-up. Data were collected systematically, including demographics, pulmonary function tests, comorbidities, medications and 6MWT-derived attributes. The prediction attributes of 6MWT were studied with a Cox Proportional-Hazards model and Kaplan-Meier survival curves. The best discriminating attribute to predict mortality was added to the prediction model Gender-Age-Physiology (GAP). In 216 patients, 2-year transplant-free survival cut-off points were identified for the 6MWD (≥413 m), 6MWD %predicted (≥83 %), SpO2-nadir (≥86 %) and distance-saturation-product (≥374 m%), with the best discriminative value for SpO2-nadir (area under the curve: 0.761). 2-Year survival percentage of patients with SpO2-nadir below or above threshold (86 %) was 37.1 % and 80.0 %, respectively. Exercise-induced oxygen desaturation added to the GAP model showed an improvement in its predictive power. Patients with IPF who have an exercise-induced oxygen desaturation have worse prognosis. Addition of SpO2-nadir to the GAP model seems promising for use in clinical care of IPF patients.","2025","Respiratory medicine"

Herein, we investigated whether venous outflow (VO) profiles on computed tomographic perfusion (CTP) were linked to TLC, regardless of the arterial collateral status. Consecutive anterior circulation AIS patients with large vessel occlusion(LVO) undergoing thrombectomy in a retrospective cohort were evaluated between January 2021 and August 2023 at two comprehensive stroke centers. All patients underwent pretreatment noncontrast computed tomography (NCCT), computed tomography perfusion (CTP) and follow-up NCCT or head magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) within 72 h of endovascular treatment (EVT). The VO profile parameters were recorded based on time-density curve derived from the CTP, including the peak time of VO (PTV) and total VO time (TVT). As the quantitative index of TLC, hypoperfusion intensity ratio (HIR) ≦0.4 was considered favorable for TLC. The primary outcome was tissue-level collaterals (TLC), defined by the HIR. Logistic regression analysis was used to assess the association between VO characteristics and TLC, whereas receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis was used to evaluate the value of VO parameters in predicting favorable TLC. This study enrolled 221 eligible patients, among whom patients with favorable TLC were found to have a shorter PTV than patients with unfavorable TLC (12 s vs.16.5 s, P < 0.001) in univariable analysis. A shorter PTV was significantly associated with a favorable TLC (odds ratio [OR], 0.811; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.709 to 0.927; P=0.002). Multivariable binary logistic stepwise regression analysis revealed that PTV was negatively correlated with TLC, regardless of the arterial collateral status was good (Good: OR, 0.777; 95%CI, 0.660-0.914; P=0.002; Poor: OR,0.729; 95%CI, 0.569-0.932; P=0.012). ROC analysis revealed that the PTV threshold for predicting favorable TLC was ≤13s, with an area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity of 0.754, 0.728, and 0.699, respectively. The comprehensive predictor combined with PTV had an optimal predictive ability for TLC with an AUC of 0.894 (sensitivity=0.839, specificity=0.864). Cerebral VO profiles in patients with anterior circulation AIS with LVO were related to TLC regardless of arterial collateral status, while PTV≤13s was a good predictor of favorable TLC.","2025","Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association"

Despite the widespread use of these treatments, no effective biomarkers currently exist to identify which patients will respond favorably to therapy. This study introduces a zebrafish patient-derived xenograft (PDX) system, capable of replicating both the carboplatin response and metastatic behavior observed in OC patients, within a rapid 3-day assay period. Two OC cell lines: carboplatin-sensitive (A2780) and resistant (OVCAR8) were used to assess differential responses to treatment in murine and zebrafish xenograft models. Tumor tissues from 16 OC patients were implanted into zebrafish embryos to test carboplatin responses and predict metastasis. Additionally, eight clinical OC samples were directly implanted into zebrafish embryos as part of a proof-of-concept demonstration. The zebrafish xenografts accurately reflected the carboplatin sensitivity and resistance patterns seen in in vitro and murine models. The zebrafish PDX model demonstrated a 67 % success rate for implantation and a 100 % success rate for engraftment. Notably, the model effectively distinguished between metastatic and non-metastatic disease, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) of 0.818. Furthermore, the zebrafish PDX model showed a high concordance with patient-specific responses to carboplatin. This zebrafish PDX model offers a fast, accurate, and clinically relevant platform for evaluating carboplatin response and predicting metastasis in OC patients. It holds significant potential for advancing personalized medicine, allowing for more precise therapeutic outcome predictions and individualized treatment strategies.","2025","Drug resistance updates : reviews and commentaries in antimicrobial and anticancer chemotherapy"

Machine learning approaches can potentially overcome the limitations of conventional statistical methods and provide more accurate, personalized risk estimates. The authors sought to develop and externally validate a novel machine learning algorithm for predicting all-cause mortality and/or heart failure (HF) hospitalization in ICD patients with and without cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) using variables that are readily available to treating clinicians. We also sought to identify key factors that separate patients along a continuum of risk. Random forest for survival, longitudinal, and multivariate (RF-SLAM) data analysis was applied to predict 3-month and 1-year risks for all-cause mortality and a composite outcome of death/HF hospitalization during the first 5 years of device implant. Models were trained using a nationwide cohort from the Veterans Health Administration. Three models were sequentially tested, and external validation was performed in a separate nonveteran clinical registry. The training and validation cohorts included 12,043 patients (age 67.5 ± 9.4 years) and 1,394 patients (age 66.3 ± 11.9 years), respectively. Median follow-up was 3.3 years for the training cohort and 3.6 years for validation cohort. The most accurate models for both outcomes included baseline demographics entered at the time of ICD implant (age, sex, CRT therapy) and time-varying ICD data with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve for predicting death at 3 months (0.91; 95% CI: 0.87-0.94) and 1 year (0.80; 95% CI: 0.78-0.82); death/HF hospitalization at 3 months (0.81; 95% CI: 0.79-0.83) and 1 year (0.71; 95% CI: 0.70-0.72). Models demonstrated high discrimination and good calibration in the validation cohort. Additionally, time-varying physiologic data from ICDs, especially daily physical activity, had substantial importance in predicting outcomes. The RF-SLAM algorithm accurately predicted all-cause mortality and death/HF hospitalization at 3 months and 1 year during the first 5 years of device implant, demonstrating good internal and external validity. Prospective studies and randomized trials are needed to evaluate model performance in other populations and settings and to determine its impact on patient outcomes.","2025","Journal of the American College of Cardiology"

PANoptosis, a novel form of programmed cell death, has been implicated in inflammatory diseases, but its specific role in UC remains unclear. This study aimed to identify PANoptosis-related genes (PRGs) that may contribute to immune dysregulation in UC. Using bioinformatics analysis of the GEO databases, we identified seven hub PRGs. Based on these genes, we developed a predictive model to differentiate UC patients from healthy controls, and evaluated its diagnostic performance using ROC curve analysis. We further conducted functional enrichment, GSVA, and immune infiltration analyses. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) was used to validate the expression of hub genes in UC patients. The prediction model, based on the seven hub genes, exhibited diagnostic ability in discriminating UC patients from controls. Furthermore, these hub PRGs were found to be associated with immune cells, including dendritic cells, NK cells, macrophages, regulatory T cells (Tregs), and CD8+ T cells. They were also linked to key signaling pathways implicated in UC pathogenesis, such as IFNγ, TNFα, IL6-and JAK-STAT3, as well as hypoxia and apoptosis. Immunohistochemistry analysis validated the expression levels of hub PRGs in UC patients using paraffin sections of intestinal biopsy specimens. This study identified PANoptosis-related genes with potential diagnostic value for UC and suggest that PANoptosis may contribute to the pathogenesis of UC by regulating specific immune cells and interacting with key signaling pathways.

In 153 eyes (31 with type 1 and 122 with type 2 diabetes; n = 149 patients), 37% had no signs of DR, 40% had mild nonproliferative DR (NPDR), and 23% had moderate NPDR. Aqueous RBP3 decreased from a median of 2.1 nmol/L (interquartile range 0.8-3.4) in eyes with no DR to 1.5 nmol/L (0.8-3.8) in eyes with mild-to-moderate NPDR (P = 0.047). The difference between aqueous RBP3 levels in those with type 1 or type 2 diabetes was not significant. Elevated RBP3 (β = -0.701, 95% CI -1.151 to 0.250, P = 0.002) was associated with no DME history. With a mean follow-up of 5.5 ± 3.6 years, elevated RBP3 at baseline was associated with less subsequent DR progression (odds ratio 0.51, 95% CI 0.28-0.93, P = 0.03). In multivariable analyses, RBP3 remained significantly associated with a DR progression and history of DME. A 5% improvement was seen in the area under the curve when RBP3 was added to clinical models for predicting DR progression (P < 0.05).

In this study, based on the ""mass reaction parallel line method"", with acarbose as the control and PF extract as the test material, a biological evaluation method for PF hypoglycemic activity based on α-glucosidase inhibition was established for the first time. The in vitro and in vivo validation experiments showed that the coefficient (r) of correlation between the biological evaluation results and the AUC of rat postprandial blood glucose concentration was as high as 0.866, which confirmed the reliability of the evaluation method. The analysis of 20 batches of PF samples showed that the hypoglycemia potency of PF ranged from 2.66 to 8.39 U mg-1, with an average value of 4.00 U mg-1, and the standard deviation was 1.5. UF-LC-MS was used to identify 36 components of PF capable of binding to α-glucosidase. Molecular docking results showed that the binding energy was between -3.5 and -14.3 kJ mol-1. The hypoglycemic activity of 17 available control products was tested, and 8 inhibitors were found, including hyperoside, gallic acid, and corilagin. Dose-effect analysis suggested that flavonoids and polyphenols with a phenolic hydroxyl structure could inhibit α-glucosidase. In short, this study provides a basis for the development of PF hypoglycemic functional foods.","2025","Food & function"

Despite the emphasized significance of prevention and early diagnosis of periodontitis, there is still a lack of a clinical tool for early screening of this condition. Therefore, this study aims to use explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) technology to facilitate early screening of periodontitis. This is achieved by analyzing various clinical features and providing individualized risk assessment using XAI. We used 1,012 variables for a total of 30,465 participants data from National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). After preprocessing, 9,632 and 5,601 participants were left for all age groups and the over 50 y age group, respectively. They were used to train deep learning and machine learning models optimized for opportunistic screening and diagnosis analysis of periodontitis based on Centers for Disease Control and Prevention/ American Academy of Pediatrics case definition. Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) were applied to evaluate potential associated factors, including demographic, lifestyle, medical, and biochemical factors. The deep learning models showed area under the curve values of 0.858 ± 0.011 for the opportunistic screening and 0.865 ± 0.008 for the diagnostic dataset, outperforming baselines. By using LIME, we elicited important features and assessed the combined impact and interpretation of each feature on individual risk. Associated factors such as age, sex, diabetes status, tissue transglutaminase, and smoking status have emerged as crucial features that are about twice as important than other features, while arthritis, sleep disorders, high blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and overweight have also been identified as contributing factors to periodontitis. The feature contribution rankings generated with XAI offered insights that align well with clinically recognized associated factors for periodontitis. These results highlight the utility of XAI in deep learning-based associated factor analysis for detecting clinically associated factors and the assistance of XAI in developing early detection and prevention strategies for periodontitis in medical checkups.","2025","Journal of dental research"

This study evaluated the pharmacokinetics and safety of remdesivir and its metabolites (GS-704277 and GS-441524) in participants with varying degrees of renal impairment. Results of this phase I study, along with those of a phase III study, contributed to an extension of indication for remdesivir in the USA and Europe for use in patients with COVID-19 with all stages of renal impairment, including those on dialysis, with no dose adjustment. This phase I, open-label, parallel-group study enrolled participants who had mild (n = 12), moderate (n = 11), or severe (n = 10) renal impairment or kidney failure (n = 6 with dialysis, n = 4 without dialysis). Healthy matched controls were enrolled as reference. Remdesivir was given as single intravenous doses of 100 mg (mild and moderate renal impairment), 40 mg (severe renal impairment, kidney failure predialysis), and 20 mg (kidney failure postdialysis and without dialysis). Plasma pharmacokinetics of remdesivir were not affected by mild, moderate, or severe renal impairment or kidney failure. Geometric least squares mean ratios ranged from 0.8 to 1.2 for remdesivir area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). GS-704277 AUC was up to 2.8-fold higher and GS-441524 AUC up to 7.9-fold higher in participants with renal impairment. Adverse events and laboratory abnormalities were consistent with the existing safety profile for remdesivir. Observed pharmacokinetics for remdesivir and its metabolites in participants with renal impairment aligned with expected changes based on known routes of elimination. Remdesivir was generally safe and well tolerated in participants with renal impairment, and no new safety concerns were identified. These results, along with those from the phase III study in patients with COVID-19 with severely reduced kidney function, support the use of remdesivir in patients with any degree of renal impairment with no dose adjustments.

To develop and test a blood-based assay for EAC and BE. Oesophageal MicroRNAs of BaRRett, Adenocarcinoma and Dysplasia (EMERALD) was a large, international, multicentre biomarker cohort study involving 792 patient samples from 4 countries (NCT06381583) to develop and validate a circulating miRNA signature for the early detection of EAC and high-risk BE. Tissue-based miRNA sequencing and microarray datasets (n=134) were used to identify candidate miRNAs of diagnostic potential, followed by validation using 42 pairs of matched cancer and normal tissues. The usefulness of the candidate miRNAs was initially assessed using 108 sera (44 EAC, 34 EAC precursors and 30 non-disease controls). We finally trained a machine learning model (XGBoost+AdaBoost) on RT-qPCR results from circulating miRNAs from a training cohort (n=160) and independently tested it in an external cohort (n=295). After a strict process of biomarker discovery and selection, we identified six miRNAs that were overexpressed in all sera of patients compared with non-disease controls from three independent cohorts of different nationalities (miR-106b, miR-146a, miR-15a, miR-18a, miR-21 and miR-93). We established a six-miRNA diagnostic signature using the training cohort (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC): 97.6%) and tested it in an independent cohort (AUROC: 91.9%). This assay could also identify patients with BE among patients with gastro-oesophageal reflux disease (AUROC: 94.8%, sensitivity: 92.8%, specificity: 85.1%). Using a comprehensive approach integrating unbiased genome-wide biomarker discovery and several independent experimental validations, we have developed and validated a novel blood test that might complement screening options for BE/EAC.

Herein, we propose a consistent prognosis prediction approach using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to analyze anatomical regions represented by the gray and white matter, and subsequently apply it on computed tomography (CT) to calculate the gray-white matter ratio (GWR). We compared this novel method with traditional measures to validate its ability to predict the prognosis of patients resuscitated after cardiac arrest. Conducted retrospectively at two South Korean tertiary university hospitals from January 2018 to December 2022, the study included adult cardiac arrest survivors treated with therapeutic target temperature management. Patients underwent brain CT within 2 h and brain MRI within 3 days of return of spontaneous circulation. The outcome was the neurological status at discharge. Statistical analyses included receiver operating characteristic curve analysis and determining cutoff values to predict poor neurological outcomes. Overall, 51 of the 421 adult comatose cardiac arrest survivors examined met the inclusion criteria. Among these, 33 and 18 exhibited good and poor neurological outcomes, respectively. Demographic and cardiac arrest characteristics were compared between the two groups, revealing significant differences. Analyses of gray and white matter attenuation and GWR measurements highlighted significant differences between the good and poor outcome groups. Our study introduces a novel method for measuring GWR using MRI-based brain CT, demonstrating superior prognostic accuracy in predicting neurological outcomes in patients with post-cardiac arrest syndrome compared to traditional methods.","2025","The American journal of emergency medicine"

We aimed to compare numerical CPSS to additional stroke scales using a national emergency medical services (EMS) database. Using the ESO Data Collaborative, the largest EMS database with linked hospital data, we retrospectively analyzed prehospital patient records from 2022. Each EMS record was linked to corresponding emergency department (ED) and inpatient records through a data exchange platform. Prehospital CPSS was compared to the Cincinnati Stroke Triage Assessment Tool (C-STAT), the Field Assessment Stroke Triage for Emergency Destination (FAST-ED), and the Balance Eyes Face Arm Speech Time (BE-FAST). The optimal prediction cut points for LVO screening were determined by intersecting the sensitivity and specificity curves for each scale. To compare the discriminative abilities of each scale among those diagnosed with LVO, we used the area under the receiver operating curve (AUROC). We identified 17,442 prehospital records from 754 EMS agencies with ≥1 documented stroke scale of interest: 30.3% (n = 5,278) had a hospital diagnosis of stroke, of which 71.6% (n = 3,781) were ischemic; of those, 21.6% (n = 817) were diagnosed with LVO. CPSS score ≥2 was found to be predictive of LVO with 76.9% sensitivity, 68.0% specificity, and AUROC 0.787 (95%CI 0.722-0.801). All other tools had similar predictive abilities, with sensitivity/specificity/AUROC of: C-STAT 62.5%/76.5%/0.727 (0.555-0.899); FAST-ED 61.4%/76.1%/0.780 (0.725-0.836); BE-FAST 70.4%/67.1%/0.739 (0.697-0.788). The less complex CPSS exhibited comparable performance to three frequently employed LVO detection tools. The EMS leadership, medical directors, and stroke system directors should weigh the complexity of stroke severity instruments and the challenges of ensuring consistent and accurate use when choosing which tool to implement. The straightforward and widely adopted CPSS may improve compliance while maintaining accuracy in LVO detection.","2025","Prehospital emergency care"

Numerous studies have thereafter found an association between this syndrome (defined by a low eGFRcystatin C to eGFRcreatinine ratio) and mortality and morbidity. In 2023, the syndrome was renamed selective glomerular hypofiltration syndromes (SGHS) as shrunken pores are not the only pathophysiological mechanism. Recently, some studies have used the difference between eGFRcystatin C and eGFRcreatinine to describe a similar disorder, and this investigation compares the two measures. Using a cohort of 2781 adults with a median follow-up of 5.6 years, referred for determination of glomerular filtration rate (GFR), estimated GFR (eGFR) was determined using four equations. SGHS was defined using the eGFRdifference and the eGFRratio and association to mortality investigated through adjusted Cox proportional hazard models. From each adjusted regression model, Harrell's C-index and 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Both measures were associated with mortality. No significant differences concerning hazard ratios or Harrell's C-index were found between the two measures to estimate mortality, and both identified SGHS and increased mortality in a subpopulation of 567 ""healthy"" individuals with no prior diagnosis and with no kidney disorder according to the kidney disease improving global outcomes-criteria. The eGFRdifference is not superior to the eGFRratio in diagnosing SGHS or estimating mortality. However, as the two measures do not identify the same subpopulation, using them simultaneously might improve risk stratification.","2025","Journal of internal medicine"

Weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) was employed to form gene clusters. The identified hub genes, signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and myelocytomatosis (MYC) were further evaluated by generating receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves and a nomogram prediction model. Additionally, survival rate, cardiac damage markers, and cardiac function and ferroptosis markers were evaluated in septic mouse model. STAT3 and MYC levels were measured in SCM heart tissue via immunohistochemical (IHC) staining, real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and western blot analysis. Analysis identified 225 DEGs and revealed 22 intersected genes. Of the 7 hub genes, STAT3 and MYC showed enrichment in septic heart tissue and a strong predicative ability based on AUC values. Cardiac damage, iron metabolism, and lipid peroxidation occurred in the SCM model. By experiments, STAT3 and MYC expression was increased in the SCM model. Impairment was reversed with a ferroptosis inhibitor, Fer-1. As conclusion, STAT3 and MYC are related with ferroptosis and may serve as potential SCM predictor indicators. KEY MESSAGES: Septic cardiomyopathy (SCM) often leads to high mortality in septic patients, and the diagnostic criteria still remains unclear.

Of these, 40 were diagnosed with PCS and 271 did not have PCS based on imaging and clinical criteria. We used multivariable logistic regression models and ROC curves to evaluate the association between objective gait abnormality (OGA) and PCS. Objective gait abnormality (OGA) was observed in 38/40 (95 %) posterior circulation stroke (PCS) cases and 57/271 (21 %) controls (adjusted odds ratio 144, 95 %CI 24.4-855, p < 0.0001). In a predictive model, objective gait abnormality (OGA) exhibited excellent discrimination between cases and controls (AUC 0.9599, sensitivity 95.0 %, specificity 75.6 %, positive predictive value 36.5 %, negative predictive value 99.0 %). Gait assessment emerges as a highly-sensitive screening tool for ruling out posterior circulation stroke (PCS) in acutely vertiginous patients, enabling more efficient triage and patient management.

Posaconazole (PSZ), a second-generation triazole antifungal, exhibits broad-spectrum activity but suffers from limited pulmonary concentrations and notable systemic side effects when administered orally or intravenously. This study focuses on optimizing PSZ nanocrystals-agglomerated particles for dry powder inhalers (DPIs) to enhance solubility, dissolution rates, and pulmonary deposition, ultimately improving therapeutic efficacy while minimizing systemic adverse effects. We employed wet medium milling and spray-drying techniques to formulate PSZ nanocrystals-agglomerated DPIs. Various stabilizers including HPMC, HPC, Soluplus, and PVPK30, were systematically evaluated to optimize physicochemical properties. Aerosolization performance was assessed using the Next Generation Impactor, while antifungal efficacy was evaluated through in vitro and in vivo studies. The optimized PSZ DPIs demonstrated significant enhancements in solubility and dissolution rates, with a fine particle fraction (FPF) of 78.58 ± 3.21%, ensuring optimal lung delivery. In vitro experiments revealed potent effects with minimal cytotoxicity to lung cells. In vivo studies indicated that the optimized formulation achieved a Cmax/AUC0→∞ ratio in lung tissues that was 27.32 and 6.76-fold higher than that of the oral suspension, highlighting increased local drug concentrations. This approach presents a scalable, cost-effective strategy for the pulmonary delivery of PSZ, ensuring high drug loading and promising clinical outcomes in treating pulmonary fungal infections.","2025","International journal of pharmaceutics"

The combined model was interpreted using SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) values for model interpretation. 160 healthy Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were divided into control (n = 24) and experimental (n = 136) groups, and the 12-week and 16-week groups were injected intraperitoneally with carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) for 4 weeks, one month before the final feeding period. All rats were subjected to pathological examination to determine LF stage. Upon the study's completion, 147 SD rats were assessed for liver fibrosis. 84 SD rats were diagnosed with NASH and 31, 10, and 43 rats were histologically diagnosed with no fibrosis (F0), early LF (F1-F2), and advanced LF (F3-F4). For diagnosis of NASH and staging of liver fibrosis associated with NASH, a combined mpMRI prediction model has a higher area under the receiver operating characteristic(ROC) curve (AUC) than uniparameters, especially in advanced stages of fibrosis, with an AUC of 0.929 for the combined model. In SHAP, the fat fraction(FF) value contributes most to the model for diagnosing NASH and advanced liver fibrosis, while the T2 value contributes most for diagnosing liver fibrosis and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) value contributes most for diagnosing liver cirrhosis. The mpMRI could be used to evaluate the severity of liver fibrosis in the context of NASH. Combined with SHAP value analysis, this approach can help to understand the contribution of each mpMRI feature to the predictive model.","2025","European journal of radiology"

Machine learning (ML) leverages mathematical and statistical methods to detect patterns for future disease events across large datasets from electronic health records (EHR). This study conducted training and fine-tuning of ML algorithms for the real-world prediction of asthma exacerbations in patients with physician-diagnosed asthma. Adults with ≥ 2 ICD9/10 asthma codes within 1 year and at least 30 days apart were identified from the Optum Panther EHR database between 2016 and 2023. An emergency department (ED), urgent care, or inpatient visit for asthma, while on systemic administration of corticosteroids, was considered an exacerbation. To predict factors associated with exacerbations in a 6-month study period, clinical information from patients was retrieved in the preceding 6-month baseline period. Clinical information included demographics, lab results, diagnoses, medications, immunizations, and allergies. Three models built using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), and Transformers algorithms were trained and tested on independent datasets. Predictions were explained using the SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) library. Of 1,331,934 patients with asthma, 16,279 (1.2%) experienced ≥ 1 exacerbation. XGBoost was the best predictive algorithm (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.964). Factors associated with exacerbations included a prior history of exacerbation, prednisone usage, high-dose albuterol usage, and elevated troponin I. Reduced probability of exacerbations was associated with receiving inhaled albuterol, vitamins, aspirin, statins, furosemide, and influenza vaccination. This ML-based study on asthma in the real world confirmed previously known features associated with increased exacerbation risk for asthma, while uncovering not entirely understood features associated with reduced risk of asthma exacerbations. These findings are hypothesis-generating and should contribute to ongoing discussion of the strengths and limitations of ML and other supervised learning models in patient risk stratification.","2025","Advances in therapy"

Current methods of diagnosing low bone mineral density require specialized dual x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans. Plain hand radiographs may have utility as an alternative screening tool, although optimal diagnostic radiographic parameters are unknown, and measurement is prone to human error. The aim of the present study was to develop and validate an artificial intelligence algorithm to screen for osteoporosis and osteopenia using standard hand radiographs. A cohort of patients with both a DXA scan and a plain hand radiograph within 12 months of one another was identified. Hand radiographs were labeled as normal, osteopenia, or osteoporosis based on corresponding DXA hip T-scores. A deep learning algorithm was developed using the ResNet-50 framework and trained to predict the presence of osteoporosis or osteopenia on hand radiographs using labeled images. The results from the algorithm were validated using a separate balanced validation set, with the calculation of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and receiver operating characteristic curve using definitions from corresponding DXA scans as the reference standard. There was a total of 687 images in the normal category, 607 images in the osteopenia category, and 130 images in the osteoporosis category for a total of 1,424 images. When predicting low bone density (osteopenia or osteoporosis) versus normal bone density, sensitivity was 88.5%, specificity was 65.4%, overall accuracy was 80.8%, and the area under the curve was 0.891, at the standard threshold of 0.5. If optimizing for both sensitivity and specificity, at a threshold of 0.655, the model achieved a sensitivity of 84.6% at a specificity of 84.6%.

This study examined how these measures could reflect varying extent of incomplete glottal closure in individuals with voice disorders. Thirty individuals formally diagnosed with glottal incompetence, including 10 with hypofunctional disorders (hypo group) and 20 with hyperfunctional disorders (hyper group), and 30 individuals with normal voice (control group) participated in the study. PTP was measured indirectly by intra-oral pressure during production of bilabial stop consonant-vowel syllables, PTF was measured during the sustained vowel /a/, and PTW was obtained as the product of PTP and PTF. The extent of incomplete glottal closure was quantified by normalized glottal gap (NGG) and normalized glottal gap area (NGGA) based on image analysis of videostroboscopic recordings of sustained /i/. Significant differences in all threshold measures (p < .05) were found among three participant groups with medium-to-large effect sizes (ηp2 = .128-.220), with significantly higher values for the hypo group than the control group and no significant differences between the hyper and control groups. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis showed the highest diagnostic or classification accuracy contrasting between the hypo and control groups (area under the ROC curve = .717-.757), with the highest classification accuracy for PTW. There were significant, moderate-to-strong positive correlations with NGG and NGGA for the disorders group (Pearson's r = .4244-.6226) and the hypo group (r = .5689-.8949). These measures could be effective for identifying glottal incompetence, especially for hypofunctional disorders. PTW could be more sensitive than PTP and PTF in reflecting the extent of incomplete glottal closure, consistent with theoretical predictions. Their relative sensitivities for quantifying distinct incomplete glottal closures specific to different voice disorders should be evaluated in future studies.","2025","Journal of speech, language, and hearing research : JSLHR"

Non-myopic children (SER > -0.50 D) aged 6-8 and 9-10 years were scored using the PreMO risk indicator framework, integrating baseline cycloplegic SER, AL and parental myopia data. Scores were assigned risk categories as follows: 0 = no risk, 1-3 = low risk, 4-6 = moderate risk and 7-9 = high risk. SER at ≥15 years of age was used to define refractive outcomes as 'myopic' or 'not myopic'. PreMO's predictive accuracy was analysed via Receiver Operator Characteristic curves, with Youden's J-Index identifying the optimal risk score threshold. Sensitivity, specificity and area under the curve were determined and compared with those of singular predictors, that is, SER < +0.75 D and AL ≥ 23.07 mm at 6-8 years. In the cohort of children aged 6-8 years, a PreMO risk score ≥ 4 exhibited high sensitivity in predicting myopia onset in UK (0.97) and HK (0.94) children, with high specificity in UK (0.96) and moderate specificity in HK (0.64) children. In UK children aged 6-8 years, the PreMO outperformed singular predictors such as SER and AL. Among HK children aged 9-10 years, the PreMO score maintained high sensitivity (0.90) and moderate specificity (0.72). A PreMO risk score ≥ 4 is a strong predictive indicator for future myopia onset, particularly in UK children. Despite high sensitivity in both UK and HK cohorts, specificity varied, indicating the need for contextual application of the tool, particularly in pre-myopic Asian children.","2025","Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists)"

Despite uterine rupture being a catastrophic event, there is currently no successful, validated prediction model to predict its occurrence. This was a cross-sectional study using US national birth data between 2014 and 2021. The primary objective was to identify risk factors for uterine rupture during TOLAC and to generate a prediction model for uterine rupture among singleton gestations with one prior cesarean as their only prior birth. The secondary objective was to describe the maternal and neonatal morbidity associated with uterine rupture. The association of all candidate variables with uterine rupture was tested with uni- and multi-variable logistic regression analyses. We included term and preterm singleton pregnancies with one prior birth that was cesarean birth (CB) with cephalic presentation undergoing TOLAC. We excluded pregnancies with major structural anomalies and chromosomal abnormalities. The Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) Curve was generated. p value <0.001 was considered statistically significant. Of the 270 329 singleton pregnancies with one prior CB undergoing TOLAC during the study period, there were 957 cases of uterine rupture (3.54 cases per 1000). Factors associated with uterine rupture in multivariable models were an interpregnancy interval < 18 months vs the reference interval of 24-35 months (aOR 1.55; 95% CI, 1.19-2.02), induction of labor (aOR 2.31; 95% CI, 2.01-2.65), and augmentation of labor (aOR 1.94; 95% CI, 1.70-2.21). Factors associated with reduced rates of uterine rupture were maternal age < 20 years (aOR 0.33, 95% CI 0.15-0.74) and 20-24 years (aOR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64-0.97) vs the reference of 25-29 years and gestational age at delivery 32-36 weeks vs the reference of 37-41 weeks (aOR 0.55, 95% CI 0.38-0.79). Incorporating these factors into a predictive model for uterine rupture yielded an area under the receiver-operating curve of 0.66. Additionally, all analyzed maternal and neonatal morbidities were increased in the setting of uterine rupture compared to non-rupture. Uterine rupture prediction models utilizing TOLAC characteristics have modest performance.","2025","Acta obstetricia et gynecologica Scandinavica"

Recent advancements in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and transcriptomic profiling offer promising avenues for enhanced risk prediction and understanding of disease mechanisms. GWAS summary statistics from the GIGASTROKE Consortium and genetic and phenotypic data from the UK Biobank (UKB) were used. Transcriptome-Wide Association Studies (TWAS) were conducted using FUSION to identify genes associated with IS and its subtypes across eight tissues. Colocalization analysis identified shared genetic variants influencing both gene expression and disease risk. Sum Transcriptome-Polygenic Risk Scores (STPRS) models were constructed by combining polygenic risk scores (PRS) and polygenic transcriptome risk scores (PTRS) using logistic regression. The predictive performance of STPRS was evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC). A Phenome-wide association study (PheWAS) explored associations between STPRS and various phenotypes. TWAS identified 34 susceptibility genes associated with IS and its subtypes. Colocalization analysis revealed 18 genes with a posterior probability (PP) H4 > 75% for joint expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) and GWAS associations, highlighting their genetic relevance. The STPRS models demonstrated superior predictive accuracy compared to conventional PRS, showing significant associations with numerous UKB phenotypes, including atrial fibrillation and blood pressure. Integrating transcriptomic data with polygenic risk scores through STPRS enhances predictive accuracy for IS and its subtypes. This approach refines our understanding of the genetic and molecular landscape of stroke and paves the way for tailored preventive and therapeutic strategies.","2025","Human genetics"

Four-hundred twenty-two patients from ""Lung1"" dataset were included in the study. A 3D convolutional autoencoder (AE) was built and features from the latent space extracted for further analysis. Radiomic features were derived from the 3D volume of the tumor region using PyRadiomics. Both radiomic and AE-based features underwent feature selection, by removing: i) highly correlated and ii) constant features. The selected variables were then used to derive both mono-domain (radiomics, AE and clinic) and multi-domain signatures fitting a Cox Proportional Hazard model with LASSO penalization and evaluated considering the concordance (C)-index as performance metric. Both mono-domain and multi-domain signatures could significantly differentiate high risk from low risk patients. Among the mono-domain signatures, the highest hazard ratio (HR) in the test set was obtained using radiomics (HR = 1.5428) followed by the AE-based signature (HR = 1.5012) and the clinical signature (HR = 1.4770). The best overall performance was achieved by combining all three signatures, resulting in the highest HR (HR = 1.7383), while the combination of AE-based and clinical signatures yielded the highest C-index (C-index = 0.6309). These preliminary results show that combining information carried by AE, radiomic and clinical domain shows potential for improving the prediction of overall survival in NSCLC patients.","2025","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

However, many patients with positive SLNs may not have additional positive nodes, making the prediction of non-sentinel lymph node (NSLN) metastasis challenging. Reliable prognostic tools are essential for accurately assessing NSLN metastasis. The Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC) nomogram has demonstrated effectiveness in this context, but it requires further evaluation within the Iranian breast cancer population. While ALND remains the gold standard, its unnecessary application in patients without evidence of additional positive nodes raises concerns due to potential complications such as lymphedema, nerve injury, and shoulder joint dysfunction. Furthermore, integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques presents an opportunity to enhance the precision of NSLN metastasis predictions. This study conducts an extensive comparative analysis between the MSKCC nomogram and various ML models to predict NSLN metastasis, utilizing a dataset of Iranian breast cancer patients. Employing eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) methodologies, we analyzed 16 clinical features across a cohort of 183 patients. Our methodology includes rigorous statistical evaluations and the training and validation of ML models to assess the precision and robustness of these models compared to the MSKCC nomogram. Our analysis revealed that the Random Forest (RF) model outperformed the MSKCC nomogram, achieving an accuracy of 72.2 % and an AUC of 0.77, compared to the nomogram's AUC of 0.73. Logistic Regression (LR) also demonstrated competitive performance with an accuracy of 65 % and an AUC of 0.73. The RF model exhibited high sensitivity (75 %) and precision (73 %), effectively identifying critical predictors of NSLN metastasis, including the presence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) and tumor characteristics such as type and grade. Explainable AI techniques, particularly SHAP values, provided insights into feature importance, enhancing model interpretability. Our study offers a comprehensive comparison between ML models and the MSKCC nomogram for predicting NSLN metastasis among Iranian breast cancer patients. These findings contribute valuable insights to the discourse on personalized treatment approaches, emphasizing the need for tailored prognostic tools across diverse populations.

Computational Flow Dynamics and morphological measurements have been shown to differ between ruptured and unruptured aneurysms. It is not clear if these provide any additional information above routinely available clinical observations or not. Therefore, this study investigates whether incorporating image-derived features into the established PHASES score can improve the classification of aneurysm rupture status. A cross-sectional dataset of 170 patients (78 with ruptured aneurysm) was used. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and shape analysis were performed on patients' images to extract additional features. These derived features were combined with PHASES variables to develop five ridge constrained logistic regression models for classifying the aneurysm rupture status. Correlation analysis and principal component analysis were employed for image-derived feature reduction. The dataset was split into training and validation subsets, and a ten-fold cross validation strategy with grid search optimisation and bootstrap resampling was adopted for determining the models' coefficients. Models' performances were evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The logistic regression model based solely on PHASES achieved AUC of 0.63. All models incorporating derived features from CFD and shape analysis demonstrated improved performance, reaching an AUC of 0.71. Non-sphericity index (shape variable) and maximum oscillatory shear index (CFD variable) were the strongest predictors of a ruptured status. This study demonstrates the benefits of integrating image-based fluid dynamics and shape analysis with clinical data for improving the classification accuracy of aneurysm rupture status.

This is an observational retrospective study of 142 patients admitted to the cardiothoracic intensive care unit (CTICU) after undergoing VA-ECMO insertion. CTICU of a tertiary care center. All patients admitted to the CTICU for a minimum of 24 hours, post-VA-ECMO insertion, between 2015 and 2022. Review of electronic patient records. Scores for APACHE-II, SOFA, and CASUS were calculated 24 hours after intensive care units (ICU) admission. The SAVE score was computed from the last available patient details within 24 hours of ECMO insertion. Relevant demographic, clinical, and laboratory data for the study was retrieved from electronic patient records. Pre-ECMO serum levels of lactates and creatinine were significantly associated with mortality. Lower ECMO flow rates at 4 and 12 hours post-ECMO cannulation were significantly correlated with survival to discharge. The development of arrhythmias, acute kidney injury, and the need for continuous renal replacement therapy while on ECMO were significantly associated with mortality. The APACHE-II, SOFA, and CASUS scores, calculated at 24 hours of ICU admission, were significantly higher amongst nonsurvivors. Following risk score categorization using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, it was found that APACHE-II, SOFA, and CASUS scores calculated 24 hours post-ICU admission after ECMO insertion demonstrated moderate predictive ability for mortality. In contrast, the SAVE score failed to predict mortality. APACHE-II >27 (area under the curve = 0.66), calculated 24 hours post-ICU admission after ECMO insertion, showed the greatest predictive ability for mortality. Multivariate logistic regression analysis of the four scores showed that APACHE-II >27 and SOFA >14, calculated 24 hours post-ICU admission after ECMO insertion, were independently significantly predictive of mortality. The APACHE-II, SOFA, and CASUS, calculated at 24 hours of ICU admission, were significantly higher among nonsurvivors compared with survivors. The APACHE-II demonstrated the highest mortality predictive ability. APACHE-II scores of 27 or above and SOFA scores of 14 or above at 24 hours of ICU admission after ECMO cannulation can predict mortality and assist physicians in decision-making.","2025","Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia"

Due to the high cost of manual annotation, weakly supervised WSI classification methods have gained more attention. As the most representative, multiple instance learning (MIL) generally aggregates the predictions or features of the patches within a WSI to achieve the slide-level classification under the weak supervision of WSI labels. However, most existing MIL methods ignore spatial position relationships of the patches, which is likely to strengthen the discriminative ability of WSI-level features. In this paper, we propose a novel positional encoding-guided transformer-based multiple instance learning (PEGTB-MIL) method for histopathology WSI classification. It aims to encode the spatial positional property of the patch into its corresponding semantic features and explore the potential correlation among the patches for improving the WSI classification performance. Concretely, the deep features of the patches in WSI are first extracted and simultaneously a position encoder is used to encode the spatial 2D positional information of the patches into the spatial-aware features. After incorporating the semantic features and spatial embeddings, multi-head self-attention (MHSA) is applied to explore the contextual and spatial dependencies of the fused features. Particularly, we introduce an auxiliary reconstruction task to enhance the spatial-semantic consistency and generalization ability of features. The proposed method is evaluated on two public benchmark TCGA datasets (TCGA-LUNG and TCGA-BRCA) and two in-house clinical datasets (USTC-EGFR and USTC-GIST). Experimental results validate it is effective in the tasks of cancer subtyping and gene mutation status prediction. In the test stage, the proposed PEGTB-MIL outperforms the other state-of-the-art methods and respectively achieves 97.13±0.34%, 86.74±2.64%, 83.25±1.65%, and 72.52±1.63% of the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC). PEGTB-MIL utilizes positional encoding to effectively guide and reinforce MIL, leading to enhanced performance on downstream WSI classification tasks. Specifically, the introduced auxiliary reconstruction module adeptly preserves the spatial-semantic consistency of patch features. More significantly, this study investigates the relationship between position information and disease diagnosis and presents a promising avenue for further research.","2025","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

This study proposes a Deep Forest-based machine learning framework for AHTP prediction, leveraging a multi-granularity cascade structure to enhance classification accuracy. We integrated data from BIOPEP-UWM and three previously used datasets, totaling 2000 peptide sequences, and introduced novel feature extraction methods to build a comprehensive dataset for model training. This study represents the first application of Deep Forest for AHTP identification, demonstrating substantial classification performance advantages over traditional methods (e.g., SVM, CNN, and XGBoost) as well as recent mainstream prediction models (Ensemble-AHTPpred, CNN-SVM Ensemble, and mAHTPred).

A retrospective cohort study was conducted including 25,120 blastocysts from 5278 PGT-A autologous cycles between 2017 and 2022. A theoretical cumulative live birth rate (CLBR) was calculated by binomial density function. An increase of ≥ 5% in theoretical CLBR was considered a tangible benefit when obtaining ≥ 1 euploid D7 blastocyst and ≤ 3 euploid blastocysts from D5/D6. A predictive model was built considering the number of embryos eligible for extended culture until D7, number of blastocysts already biopsied on D5/D6, and patient's age. Euploidy rates decreased for blastocysts biopsied on D5, D6, and D7 (55.6%, 39.7%, and 27.1%, P < 0.001, respectively). The probability of tangible benefit was increased with more embryos available for extended culture until D7, was decreased with higher D5/D6 blastocysts already biopsied and for older patients. The overall AUC of the final model in the validation sets was 0.75 (95% CI 0.72-0.78). Based on the predictive model, in poor cycles (< 1% tangible benefit), the benefit rate from extended culture was 0.3% and for moderate, good, and best cycles (1-10%, 10-20%, and ≥ 20% tangible benefit) were 4.4%, 14.0%, and 29.3%, respectively. An application of the predictive model is available online for external testing: https://artfertilityclinics.shinyapps.io/WET-D7/ .

Cholestasis is characterized by the disruption of bile flow, leading to intrahepatic accumulation of toxic bile acids. Bile acid regulation is a multifarious process, orchestrated by several hepatic mechanisms, namely sinusoidal uptake and efflux, canalicular secretion and intracellular metabolism. In the present study, we developed a prediction model of DIC using in vitro inhibition data for 47 marketed drugs on nine transporters and five enzymes known to regulate bile acid homeostasis. The resulting model was able to distinguish between drugs with or without DILI concern (p-value = 0.039) and demonstrated a satisfactory predictive performance, with the area under the precision-recall curve (PR AUC) measured at 0.91. Furthermore, we simplified the model considering only two processes, namely reversible inhibition of OATP1B1 and time-dependent inhibition of CYP3A4, which provided an enhanced performance (PR AUC = 0.95). Our study supports literature findings suggesting a contribution not only from a single process inhibition, but a rather synergistic effect of the key bile acid clearance processes in the development of cholestasis. The use of a quantitative model in the preclinical investigations of DIC is expected to reduce attrition rate in advanced development programs and guide the discovery and development of safe medicines.","2025","Archives of toxicology"

The current pathological assessment methods face limitations such as interobserver variability, necessitating more reliable techniques. This study seeks to predict lymph node metastasis in LUSC using deep learning models applied to histopathology images of primary tumors, offering a more accurate and objective method for diagnosis and prognosis. Whole slide images (WSIs) from the Outdo-LUSC and the cancer genome atlas cohorts were used to train and validate deep learning models. Multiinstance learning was applied, with patch-level predictions aggregated into WSI-level outcomes. The study employed the ResNet-18 network, transfer learning, and rigorous data preprocessing. To represent WSI features, innovative techniques like patch likelihood histogram and bag of words were used, followed by training of machine learning classifiers, including the ExtraTrees algorithm. The diagnostic model for lymph node metastasis showed strong performance, particularly using the ExtraTrees algorithm, as demonstrated by receiver operating characteristic curves and gradient-weighted class activation mapping visualizations. The signature generated by the ExtraTrees algorithm, named lymph node status-related in situ LUSC histopathology (LN_ISLUSCH), achieved an area under the curve of 0.941 (95% CI: 0.926-0.955) in the training set and 0.788 (95% CI: 0.748-0.827) in the test set. Kaplan-Meier analyses confirmed that the LN_ISLUSCH model was a significant prognostic factor (P = .02). This study underscores the potential of artificial intelligence in enhancing diagnostic precision in pathology. The LN_ISLUSCH model stands out as a promising tool for predicting lymph node metastasis and prognosis in LUSC. Future studies should focus on larger and more diverse cohorts and explore the integration of additional omics data to further refine predictive accuracy and clinical utility.","2025","Laboratory investigation; a journal of technical methods and pathology"

Patients aged ≥65 years hospitalized for heart failure across 15 hospitals in Japan. Sarcopenia was diagnosed according to the AWGS 2019 and SDOC definitions. According to the SDOC criteria and by integrating insights from previous research, patients were categorized into nonsarcopenia, possible sarcopenia, and sarcopenia groups. The primary outcome was 2-year mortality. Of the 1282 study patients, possible sarcopenia and sarcopenia were diagnosed in 357 and 786 individuals, respectively. Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed a significant difference between the groups. Adjusted Cox proportional hazards analysis indicated a significant stepwise association between sarcopenic status and mortality risk (possible sarcopenia: hazard ratio, 1.22; 95% CI, 0.66-2.28; P = .525; sarcopenia: hazard ratio, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.08-3.34; P = .027).

However, poor-quality ultrasound images can compromise diagnostic accuracy and increase the risk of misdiagnosis. Quality assessments are often subjective, relying on the evaluator's experience and interpretation, which can vary. This study introduces a two-stage deep learning framework designed to objectively assess ultrasound image quality using phantom data across three key parameters: 'Dead zone', 'Axial/lateral resolution', and 'Gray scale and dynamic range'. Stage 1 automatically extracts regions of interest for each parameter, while Stage 2 employs detection or classification models to evaluate image quality within these regions. To generate an overall equipment quality score, a logistic regression model combines the weighted results from each parameter. The classification model demonstrated high performance across datasets, achieving AUC scores of 98.6% for 'Dead zone', 87.7% for 'Axial/lateral resolution', and 96.0% for 'Gray scale and dynamic range'. Further analysis using guideline-compliant images of individual devices showed AUC scores of 98.2%, 92.8%, and 100%, respectively. These findings highlight deep learning's potential for quantitative and objective assessments of ultrasound image quality. Ultimately, this framework provides a streamlined approach to quality management, enabling consistent quality control and efficient scoring-based evaluation of ultrasound equipment.","2025","International journal of medical informatics"

To evaluate how established POAG PRSs perform in African-ancestry samples from the Genetics in Glaucoma Patients of African Descent (GIGA), Genetics of Glaucoma in Individuals of African Descent (GGLAD), and Million Veteran Program (MVP) datasets and compare these with European-ancestry samples. This was a multicenter, cross-sectional study of POAG cases and controls from Tanzania, South Africa, Nigeria, Ghana, and the US. Included were individuals of African descent from South Africa and Tanzania from the GIGA dataset; individuals of African descent from Ghana, Nigeria, and the US from the GGLAD dataset; and individuals of African or European descent from the US in the MVP dataset. Data were analyzed from January 2022 to July 2023. Three PRSs derived from large meta-analyses of European and Asian populations, namely Gharahkhani et al (Gharahkhani PRS), Han et al (Han PRS), and Craig et al (Craig PRS). Odds ratios (ORs) for POAG risk stratification comparing the highest and lowest quintiles; area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), and liability coefficient of determination (R2) for the addition of PRS to a baseline of age, sex, and first 5 principal components.

The following were included in each dataset: GIGA (663 cases, 476 controls), GGLAD (1471 cases, 1482 controls), and MVP (9559 cases, 64 474 controls). Increases in ORs were found for the highest POAG risk quintile ranging from an OR of 1.68 (95% CI, 1.17-2.43) in Ghanaians to 7.05 (95% CI, 2.73-19.6) in the South African multiple ancestry group (which derives from at least 5 distinct ancestral groups: Khoisan, Bantus, Europeans, Indians, and Southeast Asians) with the Gharahkhani PRS. The Han PRS showed OR increases for the highest POAG risk quintile ranging from 2.27 (95% CI, 1.49-3.47) in African American individuals in the GGLAD dataset to 7.24 (95% CI, 6.47-8.12) in Europeans. The Craig PRS predicted OR increases in the highest quintile for all groups ranging from 1.51 (95% CI, 1.05-2.18) in Ghanaians to 6.31 (95% CI, 5.67-7.04) in Europeans. However, AUROC and R2 increases above baseline were lower for all African-ancestry compared with European-ancestry groups in the 3 tested PRSs. In this cross-sectional study, despite some improvements in OR-based risk stratification using the Gharahkhani PRSs, Han PRSs, and Craig PRSs, consistently lower improvements in AUROC and R2 for African-ancestry compared with European-ancestry groups highlight the need for risk prediction models tailored to diverse populations.","2025","JAMA ophthalmology"

Preoperative inflammatory data in patients who underwent PD remained poorly studied in investigating the clinical significance of predicting postpancreatectomy acute pancreatitis (PPAP) and PPAP-associated postoperative pancreatic fistula (POPF). The clinical data of 467 patients receiving PD between January 2020 and December 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Preoperative inflammatory data were stratified according to PPAP, and independent risk factors were analyzed. Multivariate logistic regression and subgroup analyses were conducted to compare risk factors of PPAP-associated POPF and non-PPAP-associated POPF. PPAP occurred in 17.6% of patients. The incidence of other complications increased following PPAP. Among the preoperative inflammatory factors, only interleukin-6 (IL-6) increased (P < 0.001), leading to a higher incidence of PPAP and POPF (P < 0.001; P = 0.002). The area under the curve of IL-6 in predicting PPAP was 0.71 (0.65-0.77; P < 0.001). Abnormal preoperative IL-6 levels (odds ratio [OR]: 5.01; P < 0.001), soft pancreatic texture (OR: 2.15; P = 0.007), and pathology (OR: 2.03; P = 0.012) were independent risk factors for PPAP. The subgroup analysis showed that increased IL-6 (OR: 1.01; P = 0.006) and soft pancreatic texture (OR: 2.05; P = 0.033) resulted in a higher risk of PPAP-associated POPF, while increased IL-8 (OR: 1.01; P = 0.007), older age (OR: 1.05; P = 0.008), and higher body mass index (OR: 1.12; P = 0.021) correlated with non-PPAP-associated POPF.

The reference point was the time at which each patient's estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) first fell below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. The input period spanned the reference point to 1 year prior. The primary endpoint was a 50% decrease in eGFR from the mean of the input period over the 3 year evaluation period. We created predictive models for patients' primary endpoints using time series data of various variables over the input period. Among 2,533 total patients, 1,409 had reference points, 31 had records for their input and evaluation periods and had reached their primary endpoints, and 317 patients had not. The area under the curve (AUC) of the predictive model peaked (0.81) when the minimum eGFR, the difference between maximum and minimum eGFR, and both maximum and minimum urinary protein values were included in the features. The accuracy of prognosis prediction can be improved by considering the variable components of urinary protein and eGFR levels. This model will allow us to identify patients whose renal functions are relatively preserved with eGFR of more than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and are likely to benefit clinically from immediate treatment intensification.","2025","Journal of diabetes investigation"

Here we present FastGlioma, a visual foundation model for fast (<10 s) and accurate detection of glioma infiltration in fresh, unprocessed surgical tissue. FastGlioma was pretrained using large-scale self-supervision (around 4 million images) on rapid, label-free optical microscopy, and fine-tuned to output a normalized score that indicates the degree of tumour infiltration within whole-slide optical images. In a prospective, multicentre, international testing cohort of patients with diffuse glioma (n = 220), FastGlioma was able to detect and quantify the degree of tumour infiltration with an average area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 92.1 ± 0.9%. FastGlioma outperformed image-guided and fluorescence-guided adjuncts for detecting tumour infiltration during surgery by a wide margin in a head-to-head, prospective study (n = 129). The performance of FastGlioma remained high across diverse patient demographics, medical centres and diffuse glioma molecular subtypes as defined by the World Health Organization. FastGlioma shows zero-shot generalization to other adult and paediatric brain tumour diagnoses, demonstrating the potential for our foundation model to be used as a general-purpose adjunct for guiding brain tumour surgeries.

The prophylactic use of pegylated recombinant human granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (PEG-rhG-CSF) has been shown to reduce the incidence of neutropenia induced by DBRs. However, the clinical usage of PEG-rhG-CSF in EBC patients undergoing DBRs in China remains unclear. This retrospective study was conducted in 137 EBC patients receiving DBRs from September 2022 to February 2024. We compared the incidence of chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (CIN) between patients who was treated with prophylactic PEG-rhG-CSF or not by complete blood counts, evaluating the effectiveness of PEG-rhG-CSF in preventing CIN. Prophylactic PEG-rhG-CSF was given at 100 μg/kg body weight (maximum total dosage of 6 mg) once 24-48 h following chemotherapy. Meanwhile, we also collected basic patient information, the area under time-concentration curve of docetaxel, and liver and kidney function indicators. Multivariate logistic regression and Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis were employed to explore independent factors influencing neutropenia. In this study, 87 of 137 EBC patients were administrated with prophylactic PEG-rhG-CSF, while 50 were not. Compared to patients who did not receive PEG-rhG-CSF, those who received prophylactic injections had a significantly lower incidence of grade 3-4 CIN (20% vs. 4.6%, P < 0.05). Higher body surface area (BSA), lower body mass index (BMI), elevated alanine aminotransferase (ALT), and nonprophylactic use of PEG-rhG-CSF were found to be positively correlated with CIN occurrence. ROC curve analysis indicated an area under the curve of 0.756 for predicting CIN in EBC patients when BSA was 1.66 m², BMI was 24.8 kg/m², and ALT was 41 U/L, with a sensitivity of 73.08% and specificity of 73.87%.

The model with the highest average C-index was selected for further analysis, and was assessed using nomogram, time-dependent receiver operating characteristics (ROC) and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The differences in immune infiltration fractions, clinicopathological features, and response to various targeted therapies and immunotherapy between high- and low-risk groups were investigated. Furthermore, qRT-PCR, IHC, colony formation test, CCK8 assay and flow cytometry were conducted to explore the expression pattern and function of ARHGAP9 in our own patient samples and renal cancer cell lines. Totally, 156 NK cell-related genes and 5189 prognosis-related genes were identified, and 36 genes of their intersection demonstrated prognostic value. A risk model with 18 genes was established by Coxboost plus plsRcox, which can accurately predict the prognosis of ccRCC patients. Significant correlations were determined between risk score and tumor malignancy and immune cell infiltration.

However, clinical identification of SOZ often relies on physician experience and has a certain subjectivity. Therefore, it is emergent to develop quantitative computational tools to assist clinicians in identifying SOZ. We conduct a retrospective study on intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) data from 46 patients with DRE. The interactions between different brain regions are quantified by using the phase transfer entropy (PTE), based on which the causal influence index (CII) is proposed to quantify the degree of influence of nodes on the network. Subsequently, the features extracted by the CII are used to construct a random forest classification model, which the performance in identifying SOZ and the generalizability are validated in patients with successful surgeries. Then, based on the CII features of the clinically labeled SOZ, a logistic regression prediction model is constructed to predict the probability of surgical success. The statistical analysis between patients with successful and failed surgery is conducted with the Mann-Whitney U test. Finally, the consistency between the predicted SOZ and the clinically labeled SOZ is verified across different Engel classes. The classification model combining the low-frequency and high-frequency features can achieve an accuracy of 82.18% (sensitivity: 85.01%, specificity: 79.69%) and an area under curve (AUC) of 0.90 in identifying SOZ. Furthermore, the model exhibits strong generalizability in identifying SOZ in patients with MRI lesional and non-lesional, as well as those implanted with electrocorticography (ECOG) and stereotactic EEG (SEEG) electrodes. Moreover, the prediction model could achieve an average accuracy of 79.8% and an AUC of 0.84. Of note, the prediction of surgical success probability is significant between patients with successful and failed surgeries (P<0.001). Correspondingly, the highest consistency between model-predicted SOZ and clinically labeled SOZ can be observed in patients with successful surgeries, but this consistency gradually decreases with increasing Engel classes. These results demonstrate that the CII may be a potential biomarker for identifying the SOZ in patients with DRE, which may provide a new perspective for the treatment of epilepsy.","2025","Computer methods and programs in biomedicine"

In this cross-sectional study, a total of 244 participants, comprising 129 adults and 115 older adults (age>65), were included. They performed a 3-min walking task while accelerometers were affixed to the lumbar segment L3. DL models, convolutional neural network (CNN) and gated recurrent unit (GRU), were trained using 1-stride and 8-stride accelerations, respectively, to classify adult and older adult groups. SHAP was employed to explain the models' predictions. CNN achieved a satisfactory performance with an accuracy of 81.4 % and an AUC of 0.89, and GRU demonstrated promising results with an accuracy of 84.5 % and an AUC of 0.94. SHAP analysis revealed that both CNN and GRU assigned higher SHAP values to the data from vertical and walking directions, particularly emphasizing data around heel contact, spanning from the terminal swing to loading response phases. Furthermore, SHAP values indicated that GRU did not treat every stride equally. CNN accurately distinguished between adults and older adults based on the characteristics of a single stride's data. GRU achieved accurate classification by considering the relationships and subtle differences between strides. In both models, data around heel contact emerged as most critical, suggesting differences in acceleration and deceleration patterns during walking between different age groups.","2025","Computers in biology and medicine"

In this retrospective study of 199 consecutive myopic participants, corneal topography was used to analyse asymmetry in anterior corneal elevation. Amongst them, 65 participants (65 eyes) who underwent orthokeratology (31 and 34 with spherical and toric lenses, respectively) were re-evaluated. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis was used to identify the contributing factors that influenced lens decentration. Receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis was employed to assess how the corneal asymmetry vector could predict decentration. There were no significant differences in treatment zone decentration (TZDec) between participants wearing toric and spherical lenses (p = 0.60 and 0.64 for 1 week and 1 month of wear, respectively). Amongst the underlying factors, the magnitude of TZDec was only correlated with the amount of corneal asymmetry vector (standardised β = 0.44, 0.48, p < 0.001 for all) after 1 week and 1 month of wear, and the direction of TZDec after 1 month of lens wear was associated with the angle of the asymmetry vector (r = 0.25, p = 0.04). ROC analysis showed that the magnitude of corneal asymmetry vector produced accurate discrimination between non-severe and severe decentration for 1 week and 1 month of wear (area under the curve was 0.93 ± 0.04 and 0.89 ± 0.05, respectively, p < 0.001). Amongst participants whose corneal asymmetry vector exceeded 41.06 μm and was oriented inferiorly, 35.29% showed severe decentration after 1 month of lens wear. In myopic participants, corneal asymmetry existed in the 8.0 mm chord diameter. If the asymmetry vector >41.06 μm and the direction was oriented inferiorly, then practitioners must be vigilant about severe decentration which would not be alleviated by a toric design.","2025","Ophthalmic & physiological optics : the journal of the British College of Ophthalmic Opticians (Optometrists)"

We previously identified an inflammatory molecular subtype of PTC associated with poor prognosis. Based on this subtype, we aimed to develop and validate a noninvasive radiomic signature to predict prognosis and treatment response in patients with PTC. We collected preoperative ultrasound images from two large independent centers (n = 2,506) to develop and validate a deep learning radiomics signature of inflammation (DLRI) for predicting the inflammatory subtype of PTC, including its correlation with prognosis and anti-inflammatory traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) treatment. Training set 1 (n = 64) and internal validation set 2 (n = 1,108) were from Tianjin Medical University Cancer Institute and Hospital. External validation sets 1 (n = 76) and 2 (n = 1,258) were from Fudan University Shanghai Cancer Center. We developed a DLRI to accurately predict PTC's inflammatory subtype (AUC = 0.97 in training set 1 and AUC = 0.82 in external validation set 1). High-risk DLRI was significantly associated with poor disease-free survival in the first cohort [HR = 16.49, 95% confidence interval (CI), 7.92-34.35, P < 0.001] and second cohort (HR = 5.42, 95% CI, 3.67-8.02, P < 0.001). The DLRI independently predicted disease-free survival, irrespective of clinicopathologic variables (P < 0.001 for all). Furthermore, patients with high-risk DLRI were likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory TCM treatment (HR = 0.19, 95% CI, 0.06-0.55, P = 0.002), whereas those with low-risk DLRI did not. DLRI is a reliable noninvasive tool for evaluating prognosis and guiding anti-inflammatory TCM treatment in patients with PTC. Prospective studies are needed to confirm these findings.","2025","Clinical cancer research : an official journal of the American Association for Cancer Research"

We applied a multi-trait analysis approach (MTAG) to genome-wide association study data on keratoconus and quantitative keratoconus-related traits and used this to construct PRS models for keratoconus risk using several PRS methodologies. We evaluated the predictive performance of the PRSs in two biobanks: Estonian Biobank (EstBB; 375 keratoconus cases and 17 902 controls) and UK Biobank (UKB: 34 keratoconus cases and 1000 controls). Scores were compared using the area under the curve (AUC) and odds ratios (ORs) for various PRS models. The PRS models demonstrated significant predictive capabilities in EstBB, with the SBayesRC model achieving the highest OR of 2.28 per standard deviation increase in PRS, with a model containing age, sex and PRS showing good predictive accuracy (AUC = 0.72). In UKB, we found that adding the best-performing PRS to a model containing corneal measurements increased the AUC from 0.84 to 0.88 (P = 0.012 for difference), with an OR of 4.26 per standard deviation increase in the PRS. These models showed improved predictive capability compared to previous keratoconus PRS. The PRS models enhanced prediction of keratoconus risk, even with corneal measurements, showing potential for clinical use to identify individuals at high risk of keratoconus, and potentially help reduce the risk of post-LASIK ectasia.","2025","Human molecular genetics"

Clinical trial data have called into question the benefit of an ICD in patients with HF due to nonischemic cardiomyopathy (NICM). We developed a risk stratification score for ventricular tachyarrhythmia (VTA) among patients with NICM receiving a primary prevention ICD. The study population comprised 1515 patients with NICM who were enrolled in the landmark MADIT trials. Fine and Gray analysis was used to develop a model to predict the occurrence of VTAs and ICD therapies while accounting for the competing risk of non-arrhythmic mortality. External validation was carried out in the RAID Trial population. Four risk factors associated with increased risk for VTA were identified: male sex, left ventricular ejection fraction ≤25%, no indication for cardiac resynchronization therapy with a defibrillator (CRT-D), and Black race. A score was generated based on this model, and patients were stratified into low (N = 390), intermediate (N = 728), and high-risk (N = 387) groups. The 5-year cumulative incidences of VTA were 15%, 24%, and 42%, respectively. Application of score groups for the secondary endpoints of Fast VT or VF and Appropriate ICD Shock revealed similar findings. Recurrent event analysis yielded consistent results. The AUC in the validation cohort for the endpoint of Appropriate ICD Shock was 69.3. Our study shows that patients with NICM can be risk stratified using demographic and clinical variables and may be used when evaluating such patients for a primary prevention ICD.","2025","Journal of cardiovascular electrophysiology"

We used reports from 59,413 individuals to perform the current study. All advanced algorithms implemented in this article were based on R software (version 4.1.3, R Core Team, 2021). All model parameters were optimized based on resampling and cross-validation (CV). In addition, pseudo-R2 as a robust metric has been used to compare the performance of models, which, unlike most studies, considers the quality of model-predicted probabilities. The results indicated that advanced ML models' performance on training and test data was superior to logistic regression. Pseudo-R2 and AUC results showed that advanced models such as kNN, GBE, and RF had the highest scores based on test data compared to other models. The pseudo-R2 values for the models used in this study varied across the test dataset; the lowest value belonged to the logistic regression algorithm at .022, and the highest value was recorded for the kNN algorithm at .099. The agreeableness subscale is the most influential component in predicting the completion of university education, followed by conscientiousness and emotional stability. The potential of advanced methods to enhance the accuracy and validity of predictions is a promising development in our field.

Prompt and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. Non-contrast CT (NCCT) scans are commonly employed as the first-line imaging modality to identify the infarct lesion and affected brain areas, as well as to make prognostic predictions to guide the subsequent treatment planning. However, visual evaluation of infarct lesions in NCCT scans can be subjective and inconsistent due to reliance on expert experience. In this study, we propose an automatic method using VB-Net with dual-channel inputs to segment acute infarct lesions (AIL) on NCCT scans and extract affected ASPECTS (Alberta Stroke Program Early CT Score) regions. Secondly, we establish a prediction model to distinguish reperfused patients from non-reperfused patients after treatment, based on multi-dimensional radiological features of baseline NCCT and stroke onset time. Thirdly, we create a prediction model estimating the infarct volume after a period of time, by combining NCCT infarct volume, radiological features, and surgical decision. The median Dice coefficient of the AIL segmentation network is 0.76. Based on this, the patient triage model has an AUC of 0.837 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.734-0.941), sensitivity of 0.833 (95 % CI: 0.626-0.953). The predicted follow-up infarct volume correlates strongly with the DWI ground truth, with a Pearson correlation coefficient of 0.931.

This study aimed to investigate the diagnostic performance of MRI-derived indices representing medial temporal atrophy in differentiating between LBD with AD-NC and/or LATE-NC (mixed LBD [mLBD]) and without these comorbidities (pure LBD [pLBD]). This study included 24 and 16 patients with pathologically confirmed mLBD and pLBD, respectively. In addition to the well-known medial temporal atrophy and entorhinal cortex atrophy (ERICA) scores, the cross-sectional areas of the bilateral entorhinal cortices/parahippocampal gyri (ABEP) were segmented manually. Even incorporating various covariates such as age at MRI examination, sex, argyrophilic grain, the MRI-derived indices, especially ABEP, significantly correlated with the severity of AD-NC, and showed a trend of correlation with LATE-NC. For the differentiation between all mLBD and pLBD, the ERICA score and ABEP demonstrated higher diagnostic performance (area under the receiver-operating-characteristic curve [AUC] of 0.80 and 0.87, respectively). Additionally, the highest diagnostic performance for ABEP (AUC, 0.94; sensitivity, 100%; specificity, 88.9%; accuracy, 96%) was observed in differentiating between pLBD and mLBD with two comorbidities (AD-NC and LATE-NC). In patients with pathologically confirmed LBD, medial temporal atrophy was significantly correlated with AD-NC, and showed a trend of correlation with LATE-NC. Moreover, MRI-derived indices indicative of medial temporal atrophy were useful in diagnosing these comorbidities.","2025","Neuroradiology"

The aim was to explore NVC as a correlation between the functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow within the large-scale resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging brain networks in a sample of ALS patients compared to healthy controls (HCs). Forty-eight ALS patients (30 males; mean age 60.64 ± 9.62 years) and 32 HC subjects (14 males; mean age 55.06 ± 16 years) were enrolled and underwent 3 T magnetic resonance imaging. ALS patients were screened by clinical and neuropsychological scales and were retrospectively classified as very fast progressors (VFPs), fast progressors and slow progressors (SPs). Neurovascular coupling reduction within the default mode network (DMN) (p = 0.005) was revealed in ALS patients compared to HCs, observing, for this network, significant NVC differences between VFP and SP groups. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that impaired NVC in the DMN at baseline best discriminated VFPs and SPs (area under the curve 75%). Significant correlations were found between NVC and the executive (r = 0.40, p = 0.01), memory (r = 0.32, p = 0.04), visuospatial ability (r = 0.40, p = 0.01) and non-ALS-specific (r = 0.40, p = 0.01) subscores of the Edinburgh Cognitive and Behavioural ALS Screen. The reduction of brain NVC in the DMN may reflect largely distributed abnormalities of the neurovascular unit.

Using plasma proteomics profiling, we aimed to identify circulating biomarkers and dysregulated signaling pathways specific to HCM. In this multicenter case-control study, plasma proteomics profiling was performed in cases with HCM and controls with hypertensive LVH, transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, and aortic stenosis. Two-thirds of patients enrolled earlier in each disease group were defined as the training set and the remaining one-third as the test set. Protein concentrations in HCM were compared with those in hypertensive LVH (comparison 1), transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy (comparison 2), and aortic stenosis (comparison 3). Candidate proteins that meet the following 2 criteria were selected: (1) higher abundance in HCM throughout all 3 comparisons or lower abundance in HCM throughout all 3 comparisons with univariable P<0.05 and |log2(fold change)| >0.5 in both the training and test sets and (2) independently associated with HCM with multivariable P<0.05 after adjusting for clinical parameters significantly different between HCM and controls. Using the selected candidate proteins, a logistic regression model to distinguish HCM from controls was developed in the training set and applied to the test set. Finally, pathway analysis was performed in each comparison using proteins with different abundance. Overall, 4979 proteins in 1415 patients (HCM, n=879; hypertensive LVH, n=331; transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy, n=169; aortic stenosis, n=36) were analyzed. Of those, 5 proteins were selected as candidate proteins. The logistic regression model with these 5 proteins had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.86 (95% CI, 0.82-0.89) in the test set. The MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) and HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible factor 1) pathways were dysregulated in HCM throughout the 3 comparisons. This study identified circulating biomarkers that distinguish HCM from other cardiomyopathies with LVH independently from confounders and revealed signaling pathways associated with HCM.","2025","Circulation.

This retrospective observational study included patients with mRCC diagnosed between October 2014 and February 2024 who received IOIO or IOTKI treatment at Kobe University Hospital and 5 affiliated hospitals. Clinical and imaging data were collected, and target lesions were measured according to RECIST v.1.1 criteria. Time-dependent ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the prognostic value of tumor size, nephrectomy status, and IMDC risk criteria for progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). The study included 180 mRCC patients, consisting of 99 receiving IOIO therapy and 81 receiving IOTKI therapy. Time-dependent AUC analysis showed that tumor size had a higher predictive ability for PFS and OS in the IOIO group than the IOTKI group. In multivariate analysis, tumor size was a significant independent prognostic factor for PFS (HR: 1.010, 95% CI: 1.004-1.016, P < 0.001) in the IOIO group. Moreover, the AUC for tumor size was consistently superior in predicting outcomes compared to nephrectomy status and IMDC risk classification in the IOIO group. Kaplan-Meier curves indicated that tumor size effectively stratified PFS in both nephrectomized and non-nephrectomized cases. Tumor size significantly impacts the prognosis of mRCC patients treated with IOIO therapy, demonstrating greater predictive ability than nephrectomy status and IMDC risk classification. These findings suggest that tumor volume should be considered a critical factor in treatment decision-making for renal cancer, particularly in patients undergoing IOIO therapy.","2025","Urologic oncology"

Despite extensive research, the pathophysiology of FM remains poorly understood, complicating diagnosis and treatment, which often relies on self-report questionnaires. This study explored structural and functional brain changes in women with FM, identified potential biomarkers, and examined their relationship with FM severity. MRI data from 33 female FM patients and 33 matched healthy controls were utilized, focusing on T1-weighted MRI and resting-state fMRI scans. Functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed using a machine learning framework to differentiate FM patients from healthy controls and predict FM symptom severity. No significant differences were found in brain structural features, such as gray matter volume, white matter volume, deformation-based morphometry, and cortical thickness. However, significant differences in FC were observed between FM patients and healthy controls, particularly in the default mode network (DMN), somatomotor network (SMN), visual network (VIS), and dorsal attention network (DAN). The FC metrics were significantly associated with FM severity. Our prediction model differentiated FM patients from healthy controls with an area under the curve of 0.65. FC measures accurately estimated FM symptom severities with a significant correlation (r = 0.45, p = 0.007). Functional connections in the DMN, VIS, and DAN were crucial in determining FM severity. These findings suggest that integrating brain FC measurements could serve as valuable biomarkers for identifying FM patients from healthy individuals and predicting FM symptom severity, improving diagnostic accuracy and facilitating the development of targeted therapeutic strategies.","2025","Biochimica et biophysica acta.

The food effect (FE) part of the study was a randomised, 2-cycle, 2-way crossover design, which enrolled 16 participants to receive a single oral dose of 80 mg ZX-7101A tablets. ZX-7101A tablets were safe and well-tolerated in both SAD and FE studies. No participant died or experienced SAE, or withdrew prematurely. The prodrug ZX-7101A was rapidly transformed into the active ingredient ZX-7101 after a single oral dose of 40-320 mg. The blood concentration of ZX-7101A was below the lower limit of quantification at most time points. ZX-7101 reached peak concentration about 3-4 h postdose in all dose cohorts. The elimination half-life of ZX-7101 was 83.01-125.55 h, and AUC0-24 was 1655.4-11483.7 h*ng/mL.

Studies containing follow-up assessment (eg, prospective cohort studies, registry-based studies) investigating prediction models of outcomes (eg, pain intensity and disability) for people with LBP receiving conservative treatment were included. Two independent reviewers performed the study selection, the data extraction using the Checklist for critical Appraisal and data extraction for systematic Reviews of prediction Modelling Studies, and risk of bias assessment using the Prediction model Risk of Bias Assessment. Findings of individual studies were reported narratively taking into account the discrimination and calibration measures of the prediction models. Seventy-five studies developing or investigating the validity of 216 models were included in this review. Most prediction models investigated people receiving physiotherapy treatment and most models included sociodemographic variables, clinical features, and self-reported measures as predictors. The discriminatory capacity of the internal validity of the 27 prediction models for pain intensity varied greatly showing a c-statistic ranging from 0.48 to 0.94. Similarly, the discriminatory capacity for 31 models for disability had the same pattern showing a c-statistic ranging from 0.48 to 0.86. The calibration measures of the internal validity of the prediction models predicting pain intensity and disability showed to be adequate. Only one of 3 studies testing the external validity of models to predict pain intensity and disability and reported both discrimination and calibration measures, which showed to be inadequate. The prediction models predicting the secondary outcomes (eg, self-reported recovery, quality of life, return to work) showed varied performance measures for internal validity, and only 2 studies tested the external validity of models although they did not provide performance the performance measures. Several prediction models have been developed for people with LBP receiving conservative treatment; however, most show inadequate discriminatory validity. A few studies externally validated the prediction models and future studies should focus on testing this before implementing in clinical practice.","2025","Journal of clinical epidemiology"

However, its role in HCC remains unclear. The mRNA and protein expression levels of PCPE-1 were analyzed using publicly available datasets of HCC tissues and matched normal tissues. Western blotting was performed to determine PCPE-1 levels in 7 paired HCC tumor and normal tissues. Immunohistochemistry was used to detect PCPE-1 levels in 155 HCC patients. The ROC curve was employed to determine the optimal cutoff value of PCPE-1. Univariate and multivariate analyses identified independent risk factors associated with overall survival (OS) of HCC patients. Kaplan-Meier analysis assessed the relationship between PCPE-1 expression and OS, and a prognostic model was constructed. PCPE-1 protein was upregulated in HCC tissues compared to normal tissues and positively correlated with the expression of several procollagens. 78 out of 155 HCC patients exhibited elevated PCPE-1 expression with cytoplasmic staining. High PCPE-1 expression significantly correlated with tumor necrosis (P = 0.045), poorer histologic grade (G3-G4, P = 0.008), and higher α-fetoprotein (AFP) level (>20 ng/ml, P = 0.043). Both univariate and multivariate analyses showed a significant association between elevated PCPE-1 and poorer overall survival (P < 0.001 in both analyses). Remarkably, combined prognostic model with PCPE-1 and AFP effectively stratified the risk for OS in HCC. Our results demonstrate for the first time that PCPE-1 serves as an independent prognostic marker for HCC, and the combined prognostic model involving PCPE-1 and AFP emerges as a valuable tool for predicting patient outcomes.","2025","Translational oncology"

Multiple functionally similar drugs often have multiple similar side effects, resulting in the closed relationships among these nodes. However, most of previous methods did not completely encode the features from the biological perspective to mine the complex associations between the drugs and side effects. A prediction model based on interactive multi-hypergraph inferring and channel-enhanced and attribute-enhanced learning, ICAL, was proposed to fuse the global correlations reflected by multiple hypergraphs and to learn the attributes of a pair of drug and side effect nodes enhanced by the channels and attributes. First, we designed a hypergraph architecture where a hyperedge reflects the complex correlations between a single drug (side effect) and all the drugs and side effects, and the entire hypergraph composed of the hyperedges reveals the global correlations of all the drugs and side effects. Two hypergraphs were established based on two types of drug similarities, and each hypergraph implies its specific complex relationships among multiple drugs and side effects. Second, we proposed an interactive hypergraph neural network to enable the learning of global correlation features of drugs and side effects from the two hypergraphs. It propagated the node features across multiple hypergraphs and encoded the context relationships within these hypergraphs. Besides, the attentions at the channel level and at the attribute level were proposed to integrate the semantic correlations among multiple channels and to encode the long-distance dependence within the attributes of a pair of drug and side effect. The experimental results based on cross-validation showed that our new model outperformed seven advanced prediction methods in terms of AUC, AUPR, and recall rates for the top-ranked candidates. The ablation studies showed the effectiveness of global correlation learning, node feature propagation across multiple hypergraphs, and channel and attribute enhanced pairwise attribute learning.

1370,"39521726","Novel application of metabolic imaging of early embryos using a light-sheet on-a-chip device: a proof-of-concept study.","Is it feasible to safely determine metabolic imaging signatures of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide [NAD(P)H] associated auto-fluorescence in early embryos using a light-sheet on-a-chip approach? We developed an optofluidic device capable of obtaining high-resolution 3D images of the NAD(P)H autofluorescence of live mouse embryos using a light-sheet on-a-chip device as a proof-of-concept. Selecting the most suitable embryos for implantation and subsequent healthy live birth is crucial to the success rate of assisted reproduction and offspring health. Besides morphological evaluation using optical microscopy, a promising alternative is the non-invasive imaging of live embryos to establish metabolic activity performance. Indeed, in recent years, metabolic imaging has been investigated using highly advanced microscopy technologies such as fluorescence-lifetime imaging and hyperspectral microscopy. The potential safety of the system was investigated by assessing the development and viability of live embryos after embryo culture for 67 h post metabolic imaging at the two-cell embryo stage (n = 115), including a control for culture conditions and sham controls (system non-illuminated). Embryo quality of developed blastocysts was assessed by immunocytochemistry to quantify trophectoderm and inner mass cells (n = 75). Furthermore, inhibition of metabolic activity (FK866 inhibitor) during embryo culture was also assessed (n = 18). The microstructures were fabricated following a standard UV-photolithography process integrating light-sheet fluorescence microscopy into a microfluidic system, including on-chip micro-lenses to generate a light-sheet at the centre of a microchannel. Super-ovulated F1 (CBA/C57Bl6) mice were used to produce two-cell embryos and embryo culture experiments. Blastocyst formation rates and embryo quality (immunocytochemistry) were compared between the study groups. A convolutional neural network (ResNet 34) model using metabolic images was also trained. The optofluidic device was capable of obtaining high-resolution 3D images of live mouse embryos that can be linked to their metabolic activity. The system's design allowed continuous tracking of the embryo location, including high control displacement through the light-sheet and fast imaging of the embryos (<2 s), while keeping a low dose of light exposure (16 J · cm-2 and 8 J · cm-2). Optimum settings for keeping sample viability showed that a modest light dosage was capable of obtaining 30 times higher signal-noise-ratio images than images obtained with a confocal system (P < 0.00001; t-test). The results showed no significant differences between the control, illuminated and non-illuminated embryos (sham control) for embryo development as well as embryo quality at the blastocyst stage (P > 0.05; Yate's chi-squared test). Additionally, embryos with inhibited metabolic activity showed a decreased blastocyst formation rate of 22.2% compared to controls, as well as a 47% reduction in metabolic activity measured by metabolic imaging (P < 0.0001; t-test). This indicates that the optofluidic device was capable of producing metabolic images of live embryos by measuring NAD(P)H autofluorescence, allowing a novel and affordable approach. The obtained metabolic images of two-cell embryos predicted blastocyst formation with an AUC of 0.974. N/A. The study was conducted using a mouse model focused on early embryo development assessing illumination at the two-cell stage. Further safety studies are required to assess the safety and use of 405 nm light at the blastocyst stage by investigating any potential negative impact on live birth rates, offspring health, aneuploidy rates, mutational load, changes in gene expression, and/or effects on epigenome stability in newborns. This light-sheet on-a-chip approach is novel and after rigorous safety studies and a roadmap for technology development, potential future applications could be developed for ART. The overall cost-efficient fabrication of the device will facilitate scalability and integration into future devices if full-safety application is demonstrated.

Based on the Follow-up Cohort Program of Chronic Disease Risk Factors in Pudong New Area, a total of 7,194 residents from 12 townships and 35 village committees or neighborhood committees were selected. The cohort data in 2016 served as the baseline, and a follow-up was conducted on 5462 individuals from 2019 to 2020. In the analysis of stroke incidence, 5,462 subjects were included, with 616 stroke events recorded. The incidence density of stroke was 33.41 per 1000 person-years, while the China standard rate and the world standard rate were 13.78 and 12.52 per 1000 person-years, respectively. The incidence density of stroke rose with increasing quartiles of CVAI. After adjusting for potential confounders, the risk of stroke for males and females with CVAI ≥ 132.11 was 2.492 times (95% CI: 1.457 ∼ 4.260) and 1.759 times (95% CI: 1.070-2.891), respectively, compared to the groups with CVAI < 81.91. Among the eight obesity indicators, including CVAI, Visceral Adiposity Index (VAI), Body Mass Index (BMI), Waist Circumference (WC), Waist Hip Ratio (WHR), Waist Height Ratio (WHtR), Body Adiposity Index (BAI), A Body Shape Index (ABSI),and Body Roundness Index (BRI), CVAI has the highest diagnostic accuracy for female stroke using Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves (the Area under the ROC curve/AUC = 0.619). Subgroup analysis showed that smoking and dyslipidemia significantly modified the association between CVAI and stroke risk in females (interaction P < 0.05). CVAI is identified as a significant risk factor for stroke and serves as a valuable predictor of stroke, particularly in females.","2025","Journal of stroke and cerebrovascular diseases : the official journal of National Stroke Association"

This study aimed to investigate the 1STST -test-retest reliability and convergent validity and compare its physiological responses to the six-minute walk test (6MWT) in patients with Atrial fibrillation (AF). Forty-five patients with AF were included in this study. Functional exercise capacity was evaluated using the 1STST and 6MWT. For assessing test-retest reliability, the intraclass correlation coefficient and Bland-Altman plots were utilised. Convergent validity was determined by correlation analysis 1 STST and 6MWT, age, European Heart Rhythm Association score, ejection fraction, and quality of life. The cut-off point of 1STST was defined using ROC analysis. With an intraclass correlation coefficient value of 0.975 [95 % confidence interval (CI) 0.954-0.986], the 1STST demonstrated excellent-test-retest reliability. Physiological responses after tests were similar in the 1STST and 6MWT (p > 0.05). The number of 1STST repetitions was strongly associated with 6MWT distance (r = 0.809; p < 0.001). A cut-off value of ≤13 repetitions in the number of 1STST repetitions was defined as functional impairment related to an increased risk of clinical events [sensitivity: 100 %, specificity: 84.6 %; AUC:0.94; 95 % CI 0.82 to 0.98; p < 0.001]. The 1STST is a reliable and valid assessment tool that produced comparable hemodynamic responses to the 6MWT in patients with AF. Considering its feasibility and time efficiency, healthcare professionals can use the 1STST rather than the 6MWT test to measure functional exercise status in a constrained environment for this patient group.","2025","International journal of cardiology"

To support clinicians in providing fatigue-related supportive care, this study aims to develop and compare models predicting clinically relevant fatigue (CRF) occurring between two and three years after diagnosis, and to assess the validity of the best-performing model across diverse cancer populations. Patients with non-metastatic bladder, colorectal, endometrial, ovarian, or prostate cancer who completed a questionnaire within three months after diagnosis and a subsequent questionnaire between two and three years thereafter, were included. Predictor variables included clinical, socio-demographic, and patient-reported variables. The outcome was CRF (EORTC QLQC30 fatigue ≥ 39). Logistic regression using LASSO selection was compared to more advanced Machine Learning (ML) based models, including Extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), support vector machines (SVM), and artificial neural networks (ANN). Internal-external cross-validation was conducted on the best-performing model. 3160 patients were included. The logistic regression model had the highest C-statistic (0.77) and balanced accuracy (0.65), both indicating good discrimination between patients with and without CRF. However, sensitivity was low across all models (0.22-0.37). Following internal-external validation, performance across cancer types was consistent (C-statistics 0.73-0.82). Although the models' discrimination was good, the low balanced accuracy and poor calibration in the presence of CRF indicates a relatively high likelihood of underdiagnosis of future CRF. Yet, the clinical applicability of the model remains uncertain. The logistic regression performed better than the ML-based models and was robust across cohorts, suggesting an advantage of simpler models to predict CRF.","2025","Quality of life research : an international journal of quality of life aspects of treatment, care and rehabilitation"

Dietary interventions have shown beneficial metabolic effects of whole grains, but the metabolic response varies with different types of cereals. We evaluate the metabolic effects of substituting refined wheat with wholegrain rye foods within a complex diet, examining the day-long postprandial response of glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), ghrelin, glucose, and inflammatory biomarkers in individuals with overweight and obesity. Twenty-nine healthy adults with body mass index of 32 ± 9 kg/m2 were randomly assigned to 3 intervention days, separated by 1-wk washout. Participants adhered to a hypocaloric diet rich in wholegrain rye for 1 intervention and refined wheat for the second intervention and were randomly assigned to either diet for the third intervention with continuous blood sampling. No differences in GIP, GLP-1, or ghrelin levels were found between the diets when measured throughout the whole intervention day. GIP total area under the curve after the rye-based lunch was 31% (P < 0.05) lower compared with the wheat-based lunch, and ghrelin concentrations were 29% (P < 0.05) lower after the rye-based dinner. Baseline Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance-adjusted model showed 61% (P = 0.015) lower whole-day GLP-1 and 40% (P = 0.03) lower GIP after the rye-based diet. Day-long glucose incremental area under the curve was 30% (P < 0.001) lower after the rye-based diet, and glycemic variability was measured as SD reduced (-0.13 mmol/L, P = 0.04). The rye-based diet compared with refined wheat induced higher glycoprotein N-acetylation A, as measured by z-scores (0.36, P = 0.014). Overall, no day-long differences in gut hormone levels were observed, but the wholegrain rye-based compared with refined wheat-based dinner showed lower postprandial ghrelin concentrations. The rye-based diet improved day-long glycemic control in individuals with overweight and obesity. Observations of diet-induced inflammation after whole-grain rye intake warrant further investigation.

1376,"39515489","The EORTC QLU-C10D distinguished better between cancer patients and the general population than PROPr and EQ-5D-5L in a cross-sectional study.","Health state utility (HSU) instruments for calculating quality-adjusted life years, such as the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Utility - Core 10 Dimensions (QLU-C10D), derived from the EORTC QLQ-30 questionnaire, the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) preference score (PROPr), and the EuroQoL-5-Dimensions-5-Levels (EQ-5D-5L), yield different HSU values due to different modeling and different underlying descriptive scales. For example the QLU-C10D includes cancer-relevant dimensions such as nausea. This study aimed to investigate how these differences in descriptive scales contribute to differences in HSU scores by comparing scores of cancer patients receiving chemotherapy to those of the general population. EORTC QLU-C10D, PROPr, and EQ-5D-5L scores were obtained for a convenience sample of 484 outpatients of the Department of Oncology, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Germany. Convergent and known group's validity were assessed using Pearson's correlation and intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC). We assessed each descriptive dimension score's discriminatory power and compared them to those of the general population (n > 1000) using effect size (ES; Cohen's d) and area under the curve (AUC). The mean scores of QLU-C10D (0.64; 95% CI 0.62-0.67), PROPr (0.38; 95% CI 0.36-0.40), and EQ-5D-5L (0.72; 95% CI 0.70-0.75) differed significantly, irrespective of sociodemographic factors, condition, or treatment. Conceptually similar descriptive scores as obtained from the HSU instruments showed varying degrees of discrimination in terms of ES and AUC between patients and the general population. The QLU-C10D and its dimensions showed the largest ES and AUC. The QLU-C10D and its domains distinguished best between health states of the two populations, compared to the PROPr and EQ-5D-5L. As the EORTC Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) is widely used in clinical practice, its data are available for economic evaluation. The assessment of dimensions of health-related quality of life (HRQoL), such as physical functioning or depression, is important to cancer patients and physicians for treatment and side effect monitoring. Descriptive HRQoL is measured by patient-reported outcomes measures (PROM). The European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30 questionnaire and the Patient-Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) are the most common PROM in the clinical HRQoL assessment. In recent years, multidimensional preference-based HRQoL measures were developed using these PROM as dimensions. These preference-based measures, also referred to as health state utility (HSU) scores, are needed for economic evaluations of treatments. The QLQ-C30's corresponding HSU score is the Quality of Life Utility measure-Core 10 Dimensions (QLU-C10D), and PROMIS' HSU score is the PROMIS preference score (PROPr). Both new HSU scores are frequently compared to the well-established EuroQoL-5-dimensions-5-levels (EQ-5D-5L). They all conceptualize HSU differently, as they assess different dimensions of HRQoL und use different models. Both the QLU-C10D and the PROPr have thus shown systematic differences to the EQ-5D-5L but these were largely consistent across the subgroups. Convergent and known groups validity can therefore be considered established. However, as HSU is a multidimensional construct, it remains unclear how differences in its dimensions, for example, its descriptive scales, contribute to differences in HSU scores. This is of importance as it is the descriptive scales that measure clinical HRQoL. We investigated this question by assessing each dimension's ability to distinguish between a sample of 484 cancer patients and the German general population. We could show that the ability to distinguish depended on the domain: for example, for depression, the QLU-C10D and EQ-5D-5L distinguished clearer, while for physical function, PROMIS did. Overall, the QLU-C10D and its dimensions distinguish best between cancer patients and general population.","2025","Journal of clinical epidemiology"

In recent years, with the growing utilization of machine learning (ML) in the diagnosis and management of gastric cancer (GC), numerous researchers have explored the effectiveness of ML methodologies in detecting MSI. Nevertheless, the predictive value of these approaches still lacks comprehensive evidence. Accordingly, this study was carried out to consolidate the accuracy of ML in the prompt detection of MSI in GC. PubMed, the Cochrane Library, the Web of Science, and Embase were retrieved up to March 20, 2024. The risk of bias in the encompassed studies was evaluated utilizing a risk assessment tool for predictive models. Models were then subjected to subgroup analysis based on the modeling variables. A total of 12 studies, encompassing 11,912 patients with GC, satisfied the predefined inclusion criteria. ML models established in these studies were primarily based on pathological images, clinical features, and radiomics. The results suggested that in the validation sets, the pathological image-based models had a synthesized c-index of 0.86 [95 % CI (0.83-0.89)], with sensitivity and specificity being 0.86 [95 % CI (0.76-0.92)] and 0.83 [95 % CI (0.78-0.87)], respectively; radiomics feature-based models achieved respective values of 0.87 [95 % CI (0.81-0.92)], 0.77 [95 % CI (0.70-0.83)] and 0.81 [95 % CI (0.74-0.87)]; radiomics feature-based models + clinical feature-based models achieved respective values of 0.87 [95 % CI (0.81-0.93)], 0.78 [95 % CI (0.70-0.84)] and 0.79 [95 % CI (0.69-0.86)]. ML has demonstrated optimal performance in detecting MSI in GC and could serve as a prospective early adjunctive detection tool for MSI in GC.

Data were collected from six publicly available datasets in The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA). Following the inclusion and exclusion criteria, a total of 4548 CT slices from 758 cases were allocated. We evaluated multiple multi-task learning models that integrate attention mechanisms to resolve challenges in NSCLC subtype classification and clinical staging. These models utilized convolution-based modules in their shared layers for feature extraction, while the task layers were dedicated to histological subtype classification and staging. Each branch sequentially processed features through convolution-based and attention-based modules prior to classification. Our study evaluated 758 NSCLC patients (mean age, 66.2 years ± 10.3; 473 men), spanning ADC and SCC cases. In the classification of histological subtypes and clinical staging of NSCLC, the MobileNet-based multi-task learning model enhanced with attention mechanisms (MN-MTL-A) demonstrated superior performance, achieving Area Under the Curve (AUC) scores of 0.963 (95 % CI: 0.943, 0.981) and 0.966 (95 % CI: 0.945, 0.982) for each task, respectively. The model significantly surpassed its counterparts lacking attention mechanisms and those configured for single-task learning, as evidenced by P-values of 0.01 or less for both tasks, according to DeLong's test. The integration of attention encoder blocks into our multi-task learning network significantly enhanced the accuracy of NSCLC histological subtyping and clinical staging. Given the reduced reliance on precise radiologist annotation, our proposed model shows promising potential for clinical application.","2025","International journal of medical informatics"

MRI- and MRS-based liver fat fraction was measured from a circular region of interest on the right lobe of the liver. The abdominal fatty acid compositions were measured at the umbilical level with chemical shift-encoded MRI. Bland-Altman analysis, Student's t test, Mann-Whitney U test, and Spearman correlation analysis were performed. The logistic regression was applied to identify the independent factors for T2DM. Then, the predictive performance was assessed by Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses. An excellent agreement was found between liver fat fraction measured by MRS and MRI. (slope = 0.8; bias =-0.92%). In, patients with T2DM revealed lower fractions of mono-unsaturated fatty acid (Fmufa) (33.68 ± 10.62 vs 38.62 ± 12.21, P =.0089) and higher fractions of saturated fatty acid (Fsfa) (34.11 ± 9.746 vs 31.25 ± 8.66, P =.0351) of visceral fat tissue compared with patients without. BMI, HDL-c, Fmufa and Fsfa of visceral fat were independent factors for T2DM. Furthermore, Fsfa-S% was positively correlated with liver enzyme levels (P =.003 and 0.04). However, Fmufa-V% was negatively correlated with fasting blood glucose, HbA1c and HOMA-IR (P =.004, P =.001 and P =.03 respectively).

In Substrate Ablation in the Left Atrium during Sinus Rhythm Trial III, 375 patients completed the follow-up with preserved mapping data were included in the analysis. For each patient, the mean UV and BV was obtained from the electrograms sampled in left atrium (LA). Totally 301 patients experience the primary endpoint within 23.0 ± 9.2 months. While both low UV and BV had significant associations with long-term recurrence of atrial tachyarrhythmia (ATa), only mean UV was independently associated with the outcome. The model by UV with ablation feature had higher discriminatory power to predict ATa recurrence compared with BV model (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.858 vs. 0.757, p < 0.001). In subgroup analysis, UV reveals more powerful predictive efficacy compared with BV, with the AUC 0.843 versus 0.751 (p < 0.001) in circumferential pulmonary vein isolation (CPVI) alone cohort and 0.882 versus 0.750 (p < 0.001) in CPVI plus cohort, respectively. UV exhibits higher efficacy for predicting long-term ATa recurrence after ablation compared with BV in elderly patients with atrial fibrillation regardless of whether the patient accepts substrate modification. The outcome suggests that unipolar recording may better characterize LA fibrosis by capturing more comprehensive transmural features than bipolar signals. ClinicalTrials.gov; URL: https://www. gov.

Nevertheless, there is no comprehensive consensus on which anthropometric index is the best for evaluating the risk and predicting T2DM, especially in older adults. For this reason, we compared the performance of six indices for detecting T2DM in a population of Colombian older adults. We conducted a cross-sectional study of 3453 older adults (≥60 years old; 2023 women), analysing demographic characteristics, biochemical markers, and anthropometric indices including body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), adiposity index (VAI), conicity index (C-Index), and body roundness index (BRI). T2DM was defined as fasting plasma glucose ≥126 mg/dl (≥7.0 mmol/l). All the anthropometric indices correlated significantly with the presence of T2DM. An analysis of the receiver operating characteristic curve showed that for men the VAI (AUC = 0.71; moderate ES (0.78); OR = 4.13), BMI (AUC = 0.68; moderate ES (0.68); OR = 3.38), and WC (AUC = 0.68; moderate ES (0.68); OR = 3.38) are the best predictors for identifying T2DM. For women, however, the WC (AUC = 0.63; ES = 0.46; OR = 2.34) and C-Index (AUC = 0.63; ES = 0.46; OR = 2.34) were better indicators for predicting T2DM.

Thus, the ISO 11348-3 standard for assessing water quality has been established. This method is used to determine solution toxicity from the bioluminescence inhibition of Aliivibrio fischeri. However, the accuracy of measurements is influenced by the selection of individual reaction time points. This study explores the utility of the area under the curve (AUC) method in water quality detection and evaluates how A. fischeri responds to three toxicants, namely ethanol, acetone, and zinc sulfate, over time. The half-maximal effective concentrations of these three substances were found to be 10.13 %, 5.02 %, and 19.49 mg/L, respectively. Compared with the results from individual reaction time point assessments, the results of AUC comprehensively captured the effects of the toxicants, including time-dependent effects and hormetic effects, by capturing dynamic changes under different toxicant concentrations and reaction times. Therefore, AUC analysis mitigates the pitfalls associated with individual reaction times and provides a more accurate and reliable assessment method for water quality detection, contributing to a better understanding of the impact of toxic substances on aquatic environments.","2025","Comparative biochemistry and physiology.

Prompt identification and treatment are crucial in the clinical management of DT, but laboratory markers in this context are still lacking. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) has been proposed as a novel blood marker of neuroaxonal pathology. Therefore, we investigated the association between plasma NfL levels on admission and the occurrence of DT in patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD). NfL levels were measured on admission in 224 patients with AUD undergoing alcohol withdrawal treatment and in 116 healthy individuals. We monitored patients with AUD during the following 2 weeks of hospitalization and categorized them according to the prospective occurrence of DT (n = 25) or not (n = 199). Plasma NfL levels at admission were highest in patients who later developed DT, compared to AUD patients without DT, and healthy individuals (63.1 ± 47.2, 24.0 ± 22.4, 11.8 ± 6.1 pg/mL, respectively, p < 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic analysis revealed that a cut-off NfL level of 27.2 pg/mL could discriminate AUD patients who later developed DT (sensitivity: 80.0 %; specificity: 72.4 %; area under the curve: 0.84, p < 0.001), with an odds ratio of 9.43 (95 % CI 3.26-27.32; p < 0.001) for the risk of developing DT. Our findings suggest that NfL levels at admission may predict DT occurrence in patients with AUD and implicate neuroaxonal pathology in the pathophysiology of DT. Further research is needed to validate these findings and to explore the underlying neurobiological mechanisms.","2025","Progress in neuro-psychopharmacology & biological psychiatry"

We sought to describe a simple scoring model, the Mangled Lower Extremity (MangLE) score, which can predict those who are highly unlikely to need an amputation as a means to direct resources to this cohort. This is a retrospective study using the 2013-2021 American College of Surgeons Trauma Quality Improvement Program data set. Adult patients with a mangled lower extremity, defined as a crush injury or a fracture of the femur or tibia combined with severe soft tissue injury, arterial injury, or nerve injury, were included. Patients who suffered a traumatic lower extremity amputation, underwent amputation within 24 hours of admission, or who died within 24 hours of admission were excluded. Patients were divided into those who did/did not undergo amputation during their hospital stay. Demographics, injury mechanism, Injury Severity Score, and Abbreviated Injury Scale score, initial vital signs, and comorbid conditions were abstracted. A logistic regression model was constructed and the top five most important variables were used to create the score. The study includes 107,620 patients, of whom 2,711 (2.5%) underwent amputation. The five variables with the highest predictive value for amputation were arterial injury, lower-extremity Abbreviated Injury Scale score of ≥3, crush injury, blunt mechanism, and shock index. The lowest possible MangLE score was 0, and the highest was 15. The model demonstrated an excellent predictive ability for lower extremity amputation in both the development and validation data set with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.81 (95% confidence interval, 0.80-0.82) and 0.82 (95% confidence interval, 0.81-0.84), respectively. The negative predictive value for a score of <8 is 99%. The MangLE score is able to identify patients who are unlikely to require amputation.

1386,"39504915","Acute myocardial infarction risk prediction in emergency chest pain patients: An external validation study.","Chest pain is a common symptom that presents to the emergency department (ED), and its causes range from minor illnesses to serious diseases such as acute coronary syndrome. Accurate and timely diagnosis is essential for the efficient management and treatment of these patients. This study aims to expand on a model previously developed by the Chi Mei Medical Group (CMMG) Emergency Department in 2020 to predict adverse cardiac events in patients with chest pain. The main goal is to evaluate the accuracy and generalizability of the model through external validation using data from other hospitals. The initial model for this study was developed using data from three CMMG-affiliated hospitals in southern Taiwan. We utilized four supervised machine learning algorithms, namely random forest, logistic regression, support-vector clustering, and K-nearest neighbor, to predict the risk of acute myocardial infarction within a one month for emergency chest pain patients. The study used the model with the best area under the curve (AUC), recall and precision for external validation. The external validated data source was data collected from three hospitals associated with Taipei Medical University (TMU) in northern Taiwan. The original best model constructed by CMMG exhibited an AUC of 0.822, an accuracy of 0.740, a recall of 0.741, a precision of 0.566, a specificity of 0.740, and an NPV of 0.861. Subsequently, during the external validation phase, CMMG's top-performing model demonstrated acceptable validation result with TMU's data, achieving an AUC of 0.63, an accuracy of 0.661, a recall of 0.593, a precision of 0.243, a specificity of 0.691, and an NPV of 0.900. While the results indicate that the model's performance varied across different datasets and are not outstanding, the model is still acceptable for clinical application as a preliminary decision-support tool. This study highlights the importance of external validation to confirm the applicability of the previously developed predictive model in other hospital settings. Although the model shows potential in assessing chest pain patients in the ED, its broad clinical application requires further validation to ensure it can improve patient outcomes and optimize healthcare resource allocation.","2025","International journal of medical informatics"

However, its potential as a diagnostic hallmark for tuberculosis (TB) has yet to be explored. Here, we comprehensively analyze miRNA profiles in exosomes derived from the plasma of active TB patients and healthy persons to evaluate its efficacy in TB diagnosis. Small-RNA transcriptomic profiling analysis identified a total of 14 differentially expressed miRNAs (DEmiRNAs), among which the diagnostic potential of exosomal miR-766-3p, miR-376c-3p, miR-1283, and miR-125a-5p was evident from their respective areas under the ROC curve, which were 0.8963, 0.8313, 0.8097, and 0.8050, respectively. The bioinformatics analysis and Luciferase reporter assays confirmed that the 3'-untranslated region of natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) mRNA was targeted by miR-766-3p. The exosomes could be internalized by the A549 cells in co-culturing experiments. Furthermore, both increased miR-766-3p and decreased NRAMP1 expression were observed in Mtb-infected A549 cells. MiR-766-3p overexpression reduced the NRAMP1 levels, but increased intracellular Mtb, suggesting that miR-766-3p may facilitate Mtb survival by targeting NRAMP1. Moreover, miR-766-3p-transfected cells exhibited increased apoptosis and reduced proliferation following Mtb infection. Taken together, circulating exosomal miR-766-3p, miR-1283, miR-125a-5p, and miR-376c-3p may serve as candidate hallmarks for TB diagnosis where the presence of miR-766-3p seems associated with the vulnerability to Mtb infection in humans and could be a new molecular target for therapeutic intervention of TB.","2025","Microbiological research"

This study aimed to establish the clinical relevance of PROMs by determining maximal outcome improvement (MOI) thresholds at mid-term follow-up after primary ACLR. A total of 343 patients who underwent primary single-bundle ACLR using hamstring tendon autograft at our institute were included. Patients were queried with a 2-option anchor question regarding satisfaction with their current knee symptom state. The MOI of a PROM was calculated for each patient as the percentage of improvement normalized by the maximal possible improvement. The MOI threshold for each PROM was determined as the optimal cutoff value for predicting patient satisfaction based on receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to identify predictors of achieving these thresholds. Subgroup analyses that stratified the time from injury to surgery within the cohort were performed, and MOI thresholds were recalculated within each of these subgroups. The PROMs evaluated in this study were the modified Lysholm Knee Score and the International Knee Documentation Committee Subjective Knee Evaluation Form (IKDC) score. The calculated MOI threshold was 35.1% for the Lysholm score and 46.7% for the IKDC score. A longer time from injury to surgery reduced the odds of achieving the MOI threshold for the Lysholm score (odds ratio [OR] per time bracket = 0.7114, p < 0.0001) and IKDC score (OR = 0.8038, p = 0.0003). Male sex was associated with higher odds of achieving the MOI threshold for the IKDC score (OR = 1.9645, p = 0.0143). For patients with chronicity of ≤6 months, the MOI threshold was 35.1% for the Lysholm score and 57.9% for the IKDC score, and for patients with chronicity of >6 months, the thresholds were 24.5% and 27.1%, respectively. The calculated MOI thresholds for the Lysholm and IKDC scores at mid-term follow-up after primary ACLR were 35.1% and 46.7%, respectively. Greater chronicity of the ACL injury was associated with lower odds of achieving the MOI thresholds for the PROMs at mid-term follow-up. Therapeutic Level IV .

However, the levels of oxidative stress in individuals with type 2 diabetes are higher than those in the general population, which may affect the link between monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio and cardiovascular disease deaths. And the association between the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio and mortality risk in people with type 2 diabetes still be unknown. This study aimed to investigate the prognostic significance of monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio in type 2 diabetes. This analysis involved 2,954 individuals with type 2 diabetes from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 1999-2010. The National Death Index records through December 31, 2019, was used to determine all-cause and cardiovascular mortality. The prognostic roles were determined using Cox regression models, restricted cubic spline analysis, and time-dependent receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. During an average follow-up period of 12.4 years, a total of 1,007 deaths occurred, while 252 were due to cardiovascular disease. An elevated monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio level exhibited a significant dose-response relationship with an increased risk of all-cause mortality (1.34 [95% CI 1.12, 1.60] for all-cause mortality [P trend = 0.001]). The multivariable-adjusted HR was 1.81 (95% CI 1.25, 2.63) (P trend = 0.001) for cardiovascular mortality indicating a U-shaped relationship (P nonlinear = 0.013). The results of this study indicate a U-shaped relationship between the monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio and cardiovascular mortality in individuals with diabetes. Both very low and high monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio values were found to be associated with increased cardiovascular mortality risk.","2025","Journal of diabetes investigation"

After undergoing gastric surgery, patients may experience additional unintended weight loss, resulting in severe malnutrition and potentially cachexia. We selected and incorporated patients from two centers. Cohort 1 (n = 1393) served as the development cohort, while cohort 2 (n = 501) was designated as an external validation cohort. Within cohort 1, 70% of the patients were utilized for model training, with the remaining 30% reserved for internal validation. The training set initially underwent univariate logistic regression, followed by multivariate logistic regression. The factors ultimately incorporated were used to construct the model and create nomograms. The discriminative ability was assessed using ROC curves in all three datasets, calibration curves were used to evaluate consistency, and decision curves analysis was performed to assess the clinical application value. The model incorporated 12 factors, specifically: age (OR = 1.07), preoperative BMI (OR = 0.89), surgery type (Total Gastrectomy (TG), OR = 1.83), chemotherapy (yes, OR = 1.52), stage (III, OR = 1.40), anastomotic obstruction (yes, OR = 6.85), Postsurgical Gastroparesis Syndrome (PGS) (yes, OR = 2.27), albumin (OR = 0.95), hemoglobin (OR = 0.98), triglycerides (OR = 0.36), CRP (OR = 1.07), and Neutrophil to Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR) (OR = 1.05). The model demonstrated robust performance in ROC with AUC values of 0.805 in the training set, 0.767 in the validation set, and 0.795 in Cohort 2. Calibration curves in all three datasets exhibited a high degree of concordance between actual and predicted probabilities. Decision curve analysis (DCA) indicated that the model holds substantial clinical utility across all three datasets. We have developed a predictive model for cachexia in patients undergoing gastric cancer surgery. This model enables healthcare professionals to accurately estimate the risk of cachexia in postoperative patients with nutritional deficits, allowing for timely nutritional interventions to enhance patient quality of life and prognosis.","2025","Surgical endoscopy"

The 3849 + 10 kb C->T variant leads to inclusion of cryptic exon harboring stop codon leading to the production of truncated non-functional CFTR proteins. in vitro, SPL84 treatment results in splicing modulation, which leads to an increase of correctly spliced CFTR RNA and higher levels of functional CFTR proteins. SPL84 was tested in a blinded, placebo-controlled phase 1 study in thirty two (32) healthy volunteers (HVs), each received a single dose of either SPL84 or placebo by inhalation. A total of 8 participants were randomized to each of the 4 escalating cohorts in a 3:1 ratio (active: placebo). Safety and tolerability were evaluated by monitoring adverse events (AEs), vital signs, physical exam findings, spirometry, electrocardiograms (ECG), and analyses of safety laboratories. Blood samples were obtained periodically over 24 h for measurement of systemic exposure. There were no significant changes from baseline in vital signs, clinical laboratory values, ECG, physical examination, or pulmonary function. There were no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) in the study, and there were no significant adverse events. The systemic exposure to SPL84 was low and tended to be dose dependent. The exposure, expressed in terms of area under the curve to infinity (AUCinf), at the no observed adverse effect level (NOAEL) in 9-week toxicological mice study was 7.51 µg/ml*hrs, which is ∼20 times higher than the exposure at the 160 mg dose (444 ng/ml*hrs). SPL84 was safe and well-tolerated when administered as a single inhaled dose to HVs at doses up to 160 mg, with minimal systemic exposure. There were no safety issues observed, no SAEs, no significant related AEs, and, importantly, no significant effect on pulmonary function.

Twenty patients with glioma were examined using a preoperative DGE-MRI protocol before clinical intervention. A brief hyperglycemic state was achieved by injecting 50 mL of 50% w/w D-glucose intravenously during the DGE imaging. The total acquisition time for the DGE was 15 min. Area-under-the-curve (AUC) images were calculated using the DGE images. AUC2-7min values of the glioma core, margin area, edema area, and contralateral brain parenchyma were compared using Mann-Whitney U tests. Overall, gray and white matter areas in the AUC images showed relatively low DGE signal change and bilateral symmetry. However, the tumor cores displayed a significant hyperintensity. A high DGE signal change was also seen in the necrotic, cystic, and cerebrospinal areas. These results show that DGE MRI is a feasible technique for the study of brain tumors as part of a clinical exam. Importantly, DGE MRI showed enhancement in areas confirmed histopathologically as tumors, whereas Gd T1w MRI did not show any enhancement in this area. Since the D-glucose molecule is smaller than Gd-based contrast agents, DGE MRI may be more sensitive to subtle blood-brain barrier disruptions, thus potentially providing early information about possible malignancy. These findings provide a new perspective for the further exploration and analysis of D-glucose uptake in brain tumors.","2025","NMR in biomedicine"

We trained a lasso regression model using quantitative omics data and clinical variables, deriving a combinatorial panel of lipids and clinical indices that differentiates mild fibrosis (>F1, n = 324) from non-fibrosis (F0, n = 195), with an area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) at 0.775 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.735-0.816). Circulating sulfatides (SLs) emerged as central lipids distinctly associated with fibrosis pathogenesis in MASLD. Lipidomics analysis of lipoprotein fractions revealed a redistribution of circulating SLs from high-density lipoproteins (HDLs) onto low-density lipoproteins (LDLs) in MASLD fibrosis. We further verified that patient LDLs with reduced SL content triggered a smaller activation of type II natural killer T lymphocytes, compared with control LDLs. Our results suggest that hepatic crosstalk with systemic immunity mediated by lipoprotein metabolism underlies fibrosis progression at early-stage MASLD.","2025","Cell metabolism"

We retrospectively reviewed all patients who underwent ER for upper GIMTs from January 2009 to August 2023. The MTD was measured according to the maximum transverse diameter of specimen immediately retrieved after ER. For the PEBR rate, the independent predictors and optimal cut-off value of MTD were determined by logistic regression analysis and the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. The potential significance of preoperative CT for the evaluation of MTD was also clarified. A total of 2032 patients were diagnosed with upper GIMTs after en bloc resection under endoscopy. The overall PEBR rate was 98.72% (2006/2032). The PEBR rate was 100% for 1943 GIMTs with MTD < 2.5 cm, 85.71% (60/70) for GIMTs with 2.5 cm but ≤ 3.0 cm, and 15.79% (3/19) for GIMTs with MTD > 3.0 cm, and these rates were significantly different (P < 0.01). In terms of the PEBR rate of GIMTs, the ROC curve revealed that the optimal cut-off MTD value was 3.0 cm, and logistic regression analysis revealed that MTD > 3.0 cm was an independent predictive factor (OR 71.07, 95% CI 9.14-552.43; P < 0.001). The MTD of CT was related to that of the resected specimen (r = 0.7149, P < 0.01), and CT underestimated the mean MTD of upper GIMTs by 0.17 cm (95% CI 0.09-0.24, P < 0.01). MTD is an effective indicator for predicting the PEBR rate of GIMTs after ER. Resected specimens with MTD > 3.0 cm could not be routinely retrieved en bloc.

While AI did not significantly enhance diagnostic accuracy for the experts (96.7% with AI vs 95.6% without, P = 0.360), it significantly improved accuracy for the trainees (81.0% vs 76.7%, P = 0.002).

1399,"39495620","Navigating the immune landscape with plasma cells: A pan-cancer signature for precision immunotherapy.","Immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment; however, predicting patient response remains a significant challenge. Our study identified a novel plasma cell signature, Plasma cell.Sig, through a pan-cancer single-cell RNA sequencing analysis, which predicts patient outcomes to immunotherapy with remarkable accuracy. The signature was developed using rigorous machine learning algorithms and validated across multiple cohorts, demonstrating superior predictive power with an area under the curve (AUC) exceeding 0.7. Notably, the low-risk group, as classified by Plasma cell.Sig, exhibited enriched immune cell infiltration and heightened tumor immunogenicity, indicating an enhanced responsiveness to immunotherapy. Conversely, the high-risk group showed reduced immune activity and potential mechanisms of immune evasion. These findings not only enhance understanding of the intrinsic and extrinsic immune landscapes within the tumor microenvironment but also pave the way for more precise, biomarker-guided immunotherapy approaches in oncology.","2025","BioFactors (Oxford, England)"

Transurethral resection of the bladder tumor (TURBT) is a standard procedure for initial staging and treatment. The Vesical Imaging-Reporting and Data System (VI-RADS) enhances diagnostic accuracy for muscle invasiveness through advanced imaging techniques, potentially reducing reliance on repeat TURBT and improving patient management. We aimed to evaluate the role of VI-RADS in predicting muscle invasiveness in BCa and its potential to predict adverse pathology in high-risk NMIBC to avoid unnecessary repeat TURBT procedures. In this prospective study, we included 62 patients over the age of 18 years who underwent TURBT. In a secondary phase, patients selected for restaging TURBT (re-TURBT) were included, but those with T2 tumors or low-risk NMIBC were excluded. Multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) examinations were scored by a radiologist using the VI-RADS 5 method, while a pathologist analyzed TURBT and re-TURBT samples for accurate staging. Statistical analysis evaluated the role of VI-RADS in BCa staging. The VI-RADS score was the only predictive factor for muscle invasion in multivariate analysis. Setting the VI-RADS score at >3 resulted in the highest sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic accuracy, with values of 67.0%, 89.0%, and 78%, respectively. The receiver operating characteristic area under the curve score for VI-RADS for muscle invasion was 85% for stage Ta, 61% for stage T1, and 88% for stage T2, which shows the utility of VI-RADS in the predictiveness of MIBC/NMIBC. VI-RADS is effective in stratifying BCa patients by predicting muscle invasiveness and identifying NMIBC cases that may not need repeat TURBT.","2025","Annals of surgical oncology"

We developed a gradient boosting ML model (Neo-GB) that utilizes clinical features and QEEG to forecast time-dependent seizure risk. Clinical variables included cord blood gas values, Apgar scores, gestational age at birth, postmenstrual age (PMA), postnatal age, and birth weight. QEEG features included statistical moments, spectral power, and recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) features. We trained and evaluated Neo-GB on a University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) neonatal HIE dataset, augmenting training with publicly available neonatal electroencephalogram (EEG) datasets from Cork University and Helsinki University Hospitals. We assessed the performance of Neo-GB at providing dynamic and static forecasts with diagnostic performance metrics and incident/dynamic area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (iAUC) analyses. Model explanations were performed to assess contributions of QEEG features and channels to model predictions. The UCSF dataset included 60 neonates with HIE (30 with seizures). In subject-level static forecasting at 30 min after EEG initiation, baseline Neo-GB without time-dependent features had an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of .76 and Neo-GB with time-dependent features had an AUROC of .89. In time-dependent evaluation of the initial seizure onset within a 24-h seizure occurrence period, dynamic forecast with Neo-GB demonstrated median iAUC = .79 (interquartile range [IQR] .75-.82) and concordance index (C-index) = .82, whereas baseline static forecast at 30 min demonstrated median iAUC = .75 (IQR .72-.76) and C-index = .69. Model explanation analysis revealed that spectral power, PMA, RQA, and cord blood gas values made the strongest contributions in driving Neo-GB predictions. Within the most influential EEG channels, as the preictal period advanced toward eventual seizure, there was an upward trend in broadband spectral power. This study demonstrates an ML model that combines QEEG with clinical features to forecast time-dependent risk of initial seizure onset in neonatal HIE. Spectral power evolution is an early EEG marker of seizure risk in neonatal HIE.","2025","Epilepsia"

We investigate the potential benefit of motion correction using a deep-learning (DL) network for evaluating perfusion defects. We employed a DL network for cardiac motion correction in ECG-gated SPECT-MPI images, wherein the image data from different cardiac phases are combined with respect to a reference gate to reduce motion blur. For training the DL network, 197 cases were used. Given the variability of gated images during the cardiac cycle, we investigated the detectability of perfusion defects in two distinct reference gates. To assess perfusion defect detection, we performed receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) analyses on the motion-corrected images using a separate test dataset of clinical 194 subjects, in which studies were created from actual patient data with inserted simulated-lesions as ground truth. The reconstructed images were assessed by the quantitative-perfusion SPECT (QPS) software. We also evaluated the performance on reduced-count studies (by two and four folds). The quantitative results, measured by area-under-the-ROC curve (AUC), demonstrated that DL motion correction improves the detectability of perfusion defects significantly on both standard- and reduced-count studies, and that the detectability can vary with reference cardiac phases. A joint assessment from two reference phases achieved AUC = 0.841 on the quarter-count data, higher than with ungated full-count data (AUC = 0.795, P-value = 0.0054). DL motion correction can benefit assessment of perfusion defects in standard- and reduced-count SPECT-MPI studies. It can also be beneficial to evaluate perfusion images over multiple cardiac phases.","2025","Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology"

Intraoperative 3D echocardiography data were collected prospectively, followed by postprocessing software analysis to track and reconstruct changes throughout the cardiac cycle. Data were collected from 108 patients undergoing left-sided heart surgery at 2 large academic centers-Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, MA and Rhode Island Hospital, Providence, RI-between November 2018 and April 2020. The final dataset (n = 92) included 2 groups: the no significant functional TR (NTR) group (n = 74), defined as ≤ mild TR and TA <35 mm, and the significant functional TR (FTR) group (n = 18), defined as ≥ moderate TR. 3D TEE datasets were analyzed, and the motion of TA coordinates was tracked during complete cardiac cycle in 2D and 3D planes using postprocessing and software analysis. Computational modeling of TA motion was performed using computer-aided design. In further analysis, reconstructed and 3D printed models of TV were developed for the 2 groups. `Patients in FTR group had larger TA size during the cardiac cycle, with less overall excursion and reduced annular dynamism. The 3D motion of TA for lateral, anterolateral, and posterolateral coordinates was lower in the FTR group compared to the NTR group [18 ± 6.8 vs 13.6 ± 8.5( p = 0.02); 15.2 ± 5.5 vs 11.3 ± 6.0 (p = 0.009); and 17.6 ± 6.6 vs 12.3 ± 5.2 (p = 0.002), respectively]. TAPSE derived from 3D planes was more accurate for RV function assessment when comapred with 2D FAC (area under the curve [AUC], 0.704; p = 0.011) than 2D TAPSE (AUC, 0.625; p = 0.129). Finally, in the FTR group, the anteroseptal-posterolateral diameter was consistently larger during all phases of the cardiac cycle compared to the conventionally measured septolateral diameter. 3D echocardiographic assessment of TA helps better understand its geometry and dynamism in functional TR and is more accurate than 2D measurements for RV function assessment.","2025","Journal of cardiothoracic and vascular anesthesia"

The aim of this study was to validate the RESECT-90 clinical prediction model using multicentre patient data from across the United Kingdom (UK). Data from 12 UK thoracic surgery centers for patients undergoing lung resection between 2016 and 2020 with available 90-day mortality status were used to externally validate the RESECT-90 model. Measures of discrimination (area under the receiving operator characteristic curve [AUC]) and calibration (calibration slope, calibration intercept and flexible calibration plot) were assessed as measures of model performance. Model recalibration was also performed by updating the original model intercept and coefficients. A total of 12,241 patients were included. Overall 90-day mortality was 2.9% (n = 360). Acceptable model discrimination was demonstrated (AUC 0.74 [0.73, 0.75]). Calibration varied between centers with some evidence of overall model miscalibration (calibration slope 0.80 [0.66, 0.95] and calibration intercept 0.40 [0.29, 0.52]) despite acceptable appearances of the flexible calibration plot. The model was subsequently recalibrated, after which all measures of calibration indicated excellent performance. After external validation and recalibration using a large contemporary cohort of patients undergoing surgery in multiple geographical locations across the UK, the RESECT-90 model demonstrated satisfactory statistical performance for the prediction of 90-day mortality after lung resection. Whilst the recalibrated model will require ongoing validation, the results of this study suggest that routine use of the RESECT-90 model in UK thoracic surgery practice should be considered.","2025","Clinical lung cancer"

We aimed to investigate the role of pleural fluid SUVpeak value in predicting mortality. In our single center, prospective cohort study, we enrolled 158 patients with MPE. PET/CT was independently evaluated by two nuclear medicine physicians. To identify independent predictors of 90-day mortality, we conducted both univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. Furthermore, we assessed the discriminatory ability of these predictors compared to the LENT score using the DeLong statistic. In our study, we enrolled 158 patients with a mean age of 66.29 ± 12.6 years, of whom 100 (63.3 %) were male. The majority of patients (84.9 %) had primary lung cancer, while 24 (15.1 %) had metastases from extrapulmonary malignancies. Among the followed-up patients, 51 (32 %) died within 90 days, with a median survival of 30 (17-61) days. LENT score (HR: 1.52, 95 % CI: 1.14-2.03), pleural fluid albumin value (HR: 0.92, 95 % CI: 0.87-0.97), pleural fluid SUVpeak value (HR: 1.39, 95 % CI: 1.15-1.69), and pleural effusion size (HR: 1.01, 95 % CI: 1.001-1.02) were found to be significant predictors. Furthermore, in assessing the predictive performance for 90-day mortality, ROC curve of a combination of the independent predictors was significantly higher than that of LENT score alone. Our study revealed that the metabolic characteristics of pleural fluid might predict 90-day mortality in patients with MPE. We established that the incorporation of pleural fluid SUVpeak value into the LENT score has the potential to enhance its discriminative ability.","2025","Respiratory medicine"

This study involved 126 HCC patients who underwent hepatectomy and were followed for more than 5 years. Radiomic features were extracted from arterial-phase (AP) and portal venous-phase (PVP) MRI scans, whereas pathomic features were obtained from whole-slide images (WSIs) of the HCC patients. Using LASSO Cox regression, both radiomics and pathomics signatures were established. A combined radiopathomics nomogram for predicting OS was constructed and validated. The correlation between the radiopathomics nomogram and OS prediction was evaluated, demonstrating its potential clinical utility in prognosis assessment. We selected four radiomic features from the AP and PVP MRI scans to construct a signature, achieving a concordance index (C-index) of 0.739 in the training cohort and 0.724 in the validation cohort; these results indicate favourable 5-year OS prediction. Similarly, from 1,141 pathomics features extracted from WSIs, 15 were chosen for a pathomics signature, which had C-indexes of 0.821 and 0.808 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The most robust performance was delivered by a radiopathomics nomogram, with C-index values of 0.840 in the training cohort and 0.875 in the validation cohort. Decision curve analysis (DCA) confirmed the highest net benefit achievable by the combined radiopathomics nomogram. Our findings indicate that the radiopathomics nomogram can serve as a predictive marker for hepatectomy prognosis in HCC patients and has the potential to enhance personalized therapeutic approaches.","2025","Translational oncology"

The two genes exhibit common functional polymorphisms. Approximately 9% of Europeans and white Americans are either poor CYP2D6 metabolizers or poor OCT1 transporters. In this study, we investigated the effects of OCT1 and CYP2D6 polymorphisms on berberine pharmacokinetics in humans. We confirmed in vitro that berberine is an OCT1 substrate (KM of 7.0 μM, CLint of 306 ± 29 μL/min/mg). Common OCT1 alleles *3 to *6 showed uptake reduced by at least 65% and Oct1/2 knockout mice showed 3.2-fold higher AUCs in liver perfusion experiments. However, in humans, poor OCT1 transporters did not show any differences in berberine pharmacokinetics compared with reference participants. In contrast, CYP2D6 polymorphisms significantly affected berberine metabolism, but exclusively in females. Females who were poor CYP2D6 metabolizers had an 80% lower M1-to-berberine ratio. General linear model analyses suggest strong synergistic, rather than additive, effects between female sex and CYP2D6 genotype. Overall, berberine displayed low oral bioavailability, yet females had a 2.8-fold higher AUC and a 3.6-fold higher Cmax than males (P < 0.001). These effects were only partially attributable to the sex-CYP2D6 genotype interaction. In conclusion, despite berberine being an OCT1 substrate, OCT1 deficiency did not affect berberine pharmacokinetics in humans. In contrast, CYP2D6 emerges as a critical enzyme for berberine metabolism in females, but not in males, highlighting sex-specific differences. We suggest that factors beyond CYP2D6 metabolism are determining berberine's systemic exposure, especially in males (NCT05463003).","2025","Clinical pharmacology and therapeutics"

We prospectively analyzed stroke alert activations at a comprehensive stroke center between August 1, 2022 and December 31, 2023. We applied eight stroke screening scales (BE-FAST, LAMS, PASS, FAST-ED, EMS RACE, 3-ISS, VAN, and NIHSS) to each stroke alert in the emergency department (ED) and inpatient wards. The final diagnosis was classified as AIS-LVO or AIS-MeVO, AIS without LVO or MeVO, intracranial hemorrhage, transient ischemic attack, or stroke mimic. A total of 198 patients were analyzed. The mean age was 63.9±15.3 years, 62.1% were female (n=123), and 84.3% were African American/black subjects (n=167). The LAMS scale had a strong performance (area under the curve (AUC) 0.750 (95% CI 0.668 to 0.831)), closely followed by the FAST-ED (AUC 0.736 (95% CI 0.649 to 0.822)) and the VAN (AUC 0.735 (95% CI 0.651 to 0.818)) scales. Cut-off points selected from coordinates of the receiver operating characteristic curves were 3, 3, and a positive VAN, respectively. This is the first prospective cohort study to compare the performance of eight different screening scales among stroke alerts for detection of AIS-LVO and AIS-MeVO. We found LAMS to be the most discriminative tool, followed by FAST-ED and VAN. However, the findings were non-significant, reinforcing existing retrospective literature that these validated screening scales perform similarly and one is not superior.","2025","Journal of neurointerventional surgery"

Unlike in healthy individuals, increased incretin response was not correlated with insulin response and coincided with persistently greater glucagon levels to oral glucose tolerance testing in CKD. Disruption in the incretin system and glucagon dynamics may contribute to metabolic complications in moderate-to-severe CKD. Incretins are regulators of insulin secretion and glucose homeostasis metabolized by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). CKD may modify incretin release, metabolism, or response. We performed 2-hour oral glucose tolerance testing in 59 people with nondiabetic CKD (eGFR <60 ml/min per 1.73 m2) and 39 matched controls. We measured total area under the curve and incremental area under the curve (iAUC) of plasma total glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and total glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Fasting DPP-4 levels and activity were measured. Linear regression was used to adjust for demographic, body composition, and lifestyle factors. Mean (SD) eGFR was 38±13 and 89±17 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in patients with CKD and controls, respectively. GLP-1 total area under the curve and GIP iAUC were higher in patients with CKD than controls with a mean of 1531±1452 versus 1364±1484 pM×min and 62,370±33,453 versus 42,365±25,061 pg×min/ml, respectively. After adjustment, CKD was associated with 15,271 pM×min/ml greater GIP iAUC (95% confidence intervals [CIs], 387 to 30,154) compared with controls. Adjustment for covariates attenuated associations of CKD with higher GLP-1 iAUC (adjusted difference, 122; 95% CI, −619 to 864). Plasma glucagon levels were higher at 30 minutes (mean difference, 1.6; 95% CI, 0.3 to 2.8 mg/dl) and 120 minutes (mean difference, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.2 to 1.5 mg/dl) in patients with CKD compared with controls. There were no differences in insulin levels or plasma DPP-4 activity or levels between groups. Overall, incretin response to oral glucose is preserved or augmented in moderate-to-severe CKD, without apparent differences in circulating DPP-4 concentration or activity. However, neither insulin secretion nor glucagon suppression is enhanced.","2025","Clinical journal of the American Society of Nephrology : CJASN"

The utilization of metabolomics to analyze specific metabolic markers in maternal amniotic fluid may provide innovative tools and screening methods for investigating the early pathophysiology of trisomy 21 at the functional level. Amniotic fluid samples were obtained via amniocentesis from 57 pregnancies with DS and 55 control pregnancies between 173/7 and 240/7 weeks of gestation. The targeted metabolomics focused on 34 organic acids, 17 amino acids, and 5 acylcarnitine metabolites. The untargeted metabolomics analysis concentrated on lipid profiles and included 602 metabolites that met quality control standards. Principal Component Analysis, Orthogonal Partial Least Squares Discriminant Analysis (OPLS-DA), and false discovery rate (FDR) adjustments were applied. MetaboAnalystR 5.0 was used to perform the metabolic pathway analysis on the identified differential metabolites. Fifty differential metabolites, including L-glutamine, eight organic acids, and 41 lipids, were significantly altered in DS based on three criteria: VIP > 1 in the OPLS-DA model, FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05, and |log2FC| > log2(1.5) from a volcano plot of all detected metabolites. An analysis of 212 differential metabolites, selected from both targeted and untargeted approaches (VIP > 1 in the OPLS-DA model and FDR-adjusted p-value < 0.05), revealed significant changes in nine metabolic pathways. Fourteen key metabolites were identified to establish a screening model for DS, achieving an area under the curve of 1.00.

Studies aimed at predicting ROSC, survival (or mortality), and neurological outcomes after cardiac arrest through the application of machine learning or deep learning techniques with structured data were included. Data extraction followed the guidelines of the CHARMS checklist, and the bias risk was evaluated using PROBAST tool. Models reporting the AUC metric with 95 % confidence intervals were incorporated into the quantitative synthesis and meta-analysis. After extracting 2,753 initial records, 41 studies met the inclusion criteria, yielding 97 machine learning and 16 deep learning models. The pooled AUC for predicting favorable neurological outcomes (CPC 1 or 2) at hospital discharge was 0.871 (95 % CI: 0.813 - 0.928) for machine learning models and 0.877 (95 % CI: 0.831-0.924) across deep learning algorithms. For survival prediction, this value was found to be 0.837 (95 % CI: 0.757-0.916).

The aim of this phase 2, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, randomised clinical trial was to investigate the efficacy and safety of fenofibrate in adults and adolescents with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes. We enrolled 58 individuals (aged 16 to 40 years old) with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and randomised them to daily oral treatment with fenofibrate 160 mg or placebo for 52 weeks (in a block design with a block size of 4, assigned in a 1:1 ratio). Our primary outcome was change in beta cell function after 52 weeks of treatment, assessed by AUC for C-peptide levels following a 2 h mixed-meal tolerance test. Secondary outcomes included glycaemic control (assessed by HbA1c and continuous glucose monitoring), daily insulin use, and proinsulin/C-peptide (PI/C) ratio as a marker of beta cell stress. We assessed outcome measures before and after 4, 12, 26 and 52 weeks of treatment. Blinding was maintained for participants, their healthcare providers and all staff involved in handling outcome samples and assessment. The statistical analyses for the primary outcome included 56 participants (n=27 in the fenofibrate group, after two withdrawals, and n=29 in the placebo group). We found no significant differences between the groups in either 2 h C-peptide levels (mean difference of 0.08 nmol/l [95% CI -0.05, 0.23]), insulin use or glycaemic control after 52 weeks of treatment.

Blood lipidome analysis revealed that fenofibrate repressed pathways involved in sphingolipid metabolism and signalling at week 52 compared with placebo. The 52 week intervention evoked few adverse events and no serious adverse events. Follow-up in vitro experiments in human pancreatic islets demonstrated a stress-inducing effect of fenofibrate. Contrary to the beneficial effects of fenofibrate found in preclinical studies, this longitudinal, randomised, placebo-controlled trial does not support the use of fenofibrate for preserving beta cell function in individuals with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes.

This is the first-in-human study of a bolus i.v. formulation of ET-26 to assess its safety, tolerability, hypnotic effects, and pharmacokinetics. We enrolled 58 subjects in a dose-escalating study (stage 1a, 10 cohorts, ET-26 0.05-2.8 mg kg-1) and 40 subjects in a head-to-head study (stage 1b, four cohorts). Safety estimates included vital signs, adverse events, physical examination, and laboratory tests. Hypnotic effects were evaluated using the Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation (MOAA/S) scale, bispectral index, loss of eyelash reflex, and response to pain. Adrenocortical function was assessed using plasma total cortisol (PTC), and area above the PTC baseline (AUCPTC) after adrenocorticotropic hormone stimulation. Pharmacokinetics of plasma ET-26 concentrations were investigated. No severe adverse events occurred; the most common adverse events were myoclonus (53.8%) and injection pain (47.4%), which were transient and resolved spontaneously. Vital signs remained stable. ET-26 produced rapid-onset, short-duration unconsciousness. At the 95% effective dose (ED95, 0.8 mg kg-1), ET-26 produced unconsciousness with a similar onset time (1.9 [0.6] min vs 2.1 [1.3] min) and slightly shorter duration (2.9 [0.9] vs 4.8 [1.8]) compared with etomidate 0.3 mg kg-1, and resulted in higher AUCPTC (614 [454] vs -932 [555] nmol h-1). ET-26 showed linear pharmacokinetics, and a two-compartment model best described the pharmacokinetics. ET-26 was tolerated in healthy volunteers up to 2.8 mg kg-1. It produced rapid-onset, short-acting unconsciousness with stable cardiovascular and respiratory properties. Adrenocortical function was better preserved compared with etomidate 0.3 mg kg-1.

Several etiologies, including cardiac, pulmonary, metabolic, psychogenic etc… may be involved. Acute heart failure (AHF) is among the most common causes. This study aims to evaluate, in patients presenting with acute dyspnea to the emergency departement (ED), the accuracy of a diagnostic approach combining Lung ultrasonography (LUS) and clinical assessment as compared to the traditional AHF diagnostic work-up. This is a bi-centric cross-sectional observational study, conducted at the Emergency and Cardiology Department of both the Hedi Chaker Hospital in Sfax and the Habib Thameur Hospital in Tunis for the period extending from 01/07/2022 to 30/09/2023. The diagnostic performance of pulmonary ultrasonography was studied and the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) were compared with those of clinical examination, chest X-Ray, NT-pro -BNP and the Transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) which was the reference exam. The most common cause of acute dyspnea is acute heart failure (79.3 %). LUS had a sensitivity of 94,2 % in diagnosing AHF and a specificity of 77,5 %. Its PPV and NPV were respectively 92 % and 81 %. The area under curbe (AUC) of B-Lines required for the diagnosis of interstitial pulmonary syndrome was excellent (92 %). There was a moderate significant positive correlation between the number of B-Lines and NT-Pro-BNP levels r = 0.51, P < 0.001. Also, there was a very strong significant positive relationship between the pulmonary congestion assessed by LUS and Left atrium - pressure r = 0.788, P < 0.001 CONCLUSION: LUS is an excellent test both to confirm and exclude the diagnosis of AHF in patients consulting the emergency room for acute dyspnea and therefore deserves to be performed systematically.","2025","Current problems in cardiology"

Then, we use this set of variables on a single university hospital and run an XGBoost model with Survival Cox regression on the LOS, as well as a logistic regression on binary LOS (cut-off at 4 days). Model metrics are the concordance index (c-index) and area under the curve (AUC). After applying the search strategy and exclusion criteria, 57 articles are included in the study. The list of variables is long, but mostly non-clinical data are used in the existing literature. A wide range of statistical methods are used, with a recent trend toward machine learning models. The XGBoost model results for the Cox regression in a C-index of 0.87, and the logistic regression on binary LOS has an AUC of 0.94. Many variables identified in the literature are not available at the time of admission, yet they are still used in models for predicting LOS.

The aim of the current post hoc analyses was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of CS compared with placebo in a European perspective using individual patient data from this clinical trial. Patients with knee OA randomised to CS or placebo were followed up at 1, 3 and 6 months. The algo-functional Lequesne index was used to derive the EuroQol Five-Dimension Five-Level (EQ-5D-5L) score based on a validated formula. The EQ-5D-5L scores at each time point were used to calculate the changes in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with the area under the curve method. Costs were assessed using the average price of CS in the countries where the original study took place and where CS is currently marketed. The costs of CS in three countries were then used (i.e. the Czech Republic, Italy and Switzerland). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) threshold for CS to be considered cost-effective was set at 91,870 EUR per QALY (equivalent to the usually recommended threshold of US $100,000). The study used an intention-to-treat population, i.e. patients who received one dose of the study drug, and imputed missing values using the basal observation carried forward method. No significant differences in baseline characteristics were observed between the CS group (N = 199) and the placebo group (N = 205). The mean cost of CS for 6 months of treatment was 194.74 EUR. After 6 months of treatment, CS showed a mean ICER of 33,462 (95% CI 5130-61,794) EUR per QALY gained, indicating cost-effectiveness compared with placebo. The acceptability curve for cost-effectiveness shows that the CS treatment is likely to be cost-effective compared with placebo, with a 93% probability when the ceiling ratio is set at 91,870 EUR per QALY gained. These results highlight the role of CS as a cost-effective therapeutic option in the management of OA. However, further studies taking into account the use of other healthcare resources are warranted for a more complete understanding.","2025","Advances in therapy"

One hundred and sixty-three eligible participants were enrolled (49 OVCF group,114 non-OVCF group). The T score, HU value, and VBQ score were collected retrospectively. Then, those three parameters were compared between the OVCF and non-OVCF groups and the correlations among the three were assessed. Finally, the discrimination capability of those parameters was compared by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The OVCF group showed a lower T score, lower HU value, and higher VBQ score (all P < 0.001) than the non-OVCF group. Correlations were observed among the T score, HU value, and VBQ score (all P < 0.001, HU VS. mean T score, r = 0.66; HU VS. minimum T score, r = 0.67; VBQ VS. mean/ minimum T score, r=-0.33; VBQ VS. HU, r=-0.45). The HU value indicated the maximum area under curve (AUC), followed by the VBQ score and then the T score. Moreover, the AUC of combining the VBQ score and the HU value was similar to that of the HU value. Both the HU value and the VBQ score had superior discrimination capability for patients with OVCF compared to the T score, especially for the HU value. For patients with routinely performed lumbar MRI or CT scans, the HU value or the VBQ score may provide alternative options for assessing the bone condition.","2025","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society"

To establish a fully automated deep learning-enabled model (FADLM) for automated tumor segmentation and cervical LNM prediction in PTC using ultrasound (US) video keyframes. The bicentral study retrospective enrolled 518 PTC patients, who were then randomly divided into the training (Hospital 1, n = 340), internal test (Hospital 1, n = 83), and external test cohorts (Hospital 2, n = 95). The FADLM integrated mask region-based convolutional neural network (Mask R-CNN) for automatic thyroid primary tumor segmentation and ResNet34 with Bayes strategy for cervical LNM diagnosis. A radiomics model (RM) using the same automated segmentation method, a traditional radiomics model (TRM) using manual segmentation, and a clinical-semantic model (CSM) were developed for comparison. The dice similarity coefficient (DSC) was used to evaluate segmentation performance. The prediction performance of the models was validated in terms of discrimination and clinical utility with the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), heatmap analysis, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The comparison of the predictive performance among different models was conducted by DeLong test. The performances of two radiologists compared with FADLM and the diagnostic augmentation with FADLM's assistance were analyzed in terms of accuracy, sensitivity and specificity using McNemar's x2 test. The p-value less than 0.05 was defined as a statistically significant difference. The Benjamini-Hochberg procedure was applied for multiple comparisons to deal with Type I error. The FADLM yielded promising segmentation results in training (DSC: 0.88 ± 0.23), internal test (DSC: 0.88 ± 0.23), and external test cohorts (DSC: 0.85 ± 0.24). The AUCs of FADLM for cervical LNM prediction were 0.78 (95% CI: 0.73, 0.83), 0.83 (95% CI: 0.74, 0.92), and 0.83 (95% CI: 0.75, 0.92), respectively.

Multicenter study including 10 449 patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement. Based on consensus, 21 clinical and laboratory criteria were identified and classified as major or minor. Patients were stratified as at low, moderate, high, and very high bleeding risk according to the VARC-HBR definition. The primary end point was the rate of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium type 3 or 5 bleeding at 1 year, defined as the composite of periprocedural (within 30 days) or late (after 30 days) bleeding. Patients with at least 1 VARC-HBR criterion (n=9267, 88.7%) had a higher risk of Bleeding Academic Research Consortium 3 or 5 bleeding, proportional to the severity of risk assessment (10.8%, 16.1%, and 24.6% for moderate, high, and very-high-risk groups, respectively). However, a comparable rate of bleeding events was observed in the low-risk and moderate-risk groups. The area under receiver operating characteristic curve was 0.58. Patients with VARC-HBR criteria also exhibited a gradual increase in 1-year all-cause mortality, with an up to 2-fold increased mortality risk for high and very-high-risk groups (hazard ratio, 1.33 [95% CI, 1.04-1.70] and 1.97 [95% CI, 1.53-2.53], respectively). The VARC-HBR consensus offered a pragmatic approach to guide bleeding risk stratification in transcatheter aortic valve replacement. The results of the present study would support the predictive validity of the new definition and promote its application in clinical practice to minimize bleeding risk and improve patient outcomes.","2025","Circulation.

Accurately identifying the LVI status in MIBC patients is crucial for effective risk stratification and precision treatment. We aim to develop a deep learning model to identify the LVI status in whole-slide images (WSIs) of MIBC patients. A cohort from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database was used to train a deep learning model, slide-based lymphovascular invasion predictor (SBLVIP), based on multiple-instance learning. This model was externally validated using the Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University (RHWU) and People's Hospital of Hanchuan City (PHHC) cohorts. Kaplan-Meier curves, along with univariate and multivariate Cox models, were employed to evaluate the association between the LVI status predicted by SBLVIP and the survival outcomes of MIBC patients. In the TCGA cohort, the SBLVIP model achieved an average accuracy of 0.804 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.712-0.895] and an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.77 (95% CI 0.63-0.84) in the training set. In the internal validation set, the model's average accuracy and AUC were 0.774 (95% CI, 0.701-0.846) and 0.76 (95% CI, 0.60-0.83), respectively.

Urine from 30 healthy people and 50 BC patients, including 40 non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC) patients and 10 muscle-invasive bladder cancer (MIBC) patients, were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry to identify potential diagnostic metabolites. Binary Logistic regression was used to construct biomarker panels. Correlation analysis and construction of compound-reaction-enzyme-gene network were also performed to explore the possible mechanisms of BC development. Twenty-six metabolites were identified for differentiating BC patients from healthy controls, and eight metabolites were identified for differentiating NMIBC patients form MIBC patients. The biomarker panel consisting of urate, 4-Androstene-3α, 17β-diol and 3-Indoxyl sulfate can distinguish well between BC patients and healthy controls, with an area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of 0.983.

Although early life seizures and intellectual disability are known to be correlated in TSC, the differential effects of age at seizure onset and accumulated seizure burden on development remain unclear. Daily seizure diaries, serial neurodevelopmental testing, and brain magnetic resonance imaging were analyzed for 129 TSC patients followed from 0 to 36 months. We used machine learning to identify subgroups of patients based on neurodevelopmental test scores at 36 months of age and assessed the stability of those subgroups at 12 months. We tested the ability of candidate biomarkers to predict 36-month neurodevelopmental subgroup using univariable and multivariable logistic regression. Candidate biomarkers included age at seizure onset, accumulated seizure burden, tuber volume, sex, and earlier neurodevelopmental test scores. Patients clustered into two neurodevelopmental subgroups at 36 months of age, higher and lower scoring. Subgroup was mostly (75%) the same at 12 months. Significant univariable effects on subgroup were seen only for accumulated seizure burden (largest effect), earlier test scores, and tuber volume. Neither age at seizure onset nor sex significantly distinguished 36-month subgroups, although for girls but not boys there was a significant effect of age at seizure onset. In the multivariable model, accumulated seizure burden and earlier test scores together predicted 36-month neurodevelopmental group with 82% accuracy and an area under the curve of .86. These results untangle the contributions of age at seizure onset and accumulated seizure burden to neurodevelopmental outcomes in young children with TSC. Accumulated seizure burden, rather than the age at seizure onset, most accurately predicts neurodevelopmental outcome at 36 months of age. These results emphasize the need to manage seizures aggressively during the first 3 years of life for patients with TSC, not only to promote seizure control but to optimize cognitive function.","2025","Epilepsia"

This investigation tested and evaluated the cognitive impact of obesity and T2D induced by high-fat diet (HFD) and the effect of the host genetic background on the severity of cognitive decline caused by obesity and T2D in collaborative cross (CC) mice. The CC mice are a genetically diverse panel derived from eight inbred strains. Our findings demonstrated significant variations in the recorded phenotypes across different CC lines compared to the reference mouse line, C57BL/6J. CC037 line exhibited a substantial increase in body weight on HFD, whereas line CC005 exhibited differing responses based on sex. Glucose tolerance tests revealed significant variations, with some lines like CC005 showing a marked increase in area under the curve (AUC) values on HFD. Organ weights, including brain, spleen, liver, and kidney, varied significantly among the lines and sexes in response to HFD. Behavioral tests using the Morris water maze indicated that cognitive performance was differentially affected by diet and genetic background. Our study establishes a foundation for future quantitative trait loci mapping using CC lines and identifying genes underlying the comorbidity of Alzheimer's disease (AD), caused by obesity and T2D.

Seventy-five CLBBB patients with normal LVEF, and 30 age- and sex-matched controls were enrolled in the study. Three independent physicians visually assessed the presence of ApRock and SF and left ventricular global longitudinal strain(LVGLS) and the standard deviation of time-to-peak strain in 18 segments(Ts-SD) were evaluated using two-dimensional speckle-tracking echocardiography. CLBBB patients with normal LVEF had significantly decreased LV function and synchrony as evidenced by LVGLS and Ts-SD, and CLBBB patients with either ApRock or SF had lower LVGLS than those without ApRock or SF. LVGLS were further decreased and Ts-SD was further increased in CLBBB patients with both ApRock and SF (P < 0.001). Logistic regression analysis revealed that both ApRock (OR, 4.13; P = 0.04) and SF (OR, 4.12; P = 0.03) were independently associated with LVGLS>-20 %. Combination of ApRock and SF showed the highest area under the curve for identifying LVGLS>-20 %. Furthermore, combination of ApRock and SF improved reclassification compared to ApRock alone. CLBBB patients with normal LVEF showed impaired left ventricular systolic function. The presence of both ApRock and SF was a stronger indicator of subclinical left ventricular impairment compared to either one alone, suggesting that increased attention should be paid to CLBBB patients with normal LVEF, particularly those with both ApRock and SF.","2025","International journal of cardiology"

We conducted a prospective cohort study on adult non-trauma patients with a suspected infection and at least two SIRS criteria. We defined SED as hospital discharge within 24 h (e.g. direct ED discharge or rapid ward discharge) without disease-related readmission to our hospital or death during the first seven days. A prediction model for SED was developed using multivariate logistic regression analysis and tested with k-fold cross-validation. We included 1381 patients, of whom 1027 (74.4 %) were hospitalized for longer than 24 h or re-admitted within seven days and 354 (25.6 %) met SED criteria. Parameters associated with SED were relatively young age, absence of comorbidities, living independently, yellow or green triage urgency, lack of ambulance transport or general practitioner referral, normal clinical impression scores, and risk scores (i.e., qSOFA, PIRO, MEDS, NEWS, and SIRS), normal vital sign measurements and absence of kidney and respiratory failure. The model performance metrics showed an area under the curve of 0.824. The validation showed a minimal drop in performance and indicated a good fit.

Susceptibility values were significantly higher in most contralateral GM nuclei in AIS patients than in the corresponding left or right nuclei in healthy controls. AIS patients with poor outcome showed significantly lower susceptibility value than those with good outcome in the contralateral caudate nucleus, but no significant differences were observed in other GM nuclei. Binary logistic regression analysis revealed a significant association between the susceptibility value of the contralateral caudate nucleus and poor outcome after adjustment for confounders (adjusted odds ratio 0.692, 95% confidence interval 0.486-0.986, p = 0.042). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed an acceptable ability of the susceptibility value of the contralateral caudate nucleus to predict poor outcome (area under the curve 0.740, p = 0.013). Lower iron content in the contralateral caudate nucleus was associated with poor functional outcome in AIS patients.","2025","European journal of neurology"

However, existing scoring systems often overlook patient's underlying clinical condition, which significantly impacts prognosis. Use the age-adjusted Charlson comorbidity index (aCCI) to evaluate the patient's complications to develop a more precise model for predicting transplant-free mortality in HBV-ACLF patients. Nine hundred and six patients were included for investigation and were segregated into a training cohort and a temporal validation cohort according to the chronological order of admission in a ratio of 7:3. In the training cohort, univariate analysis, logistic regression analysis and LASSO regression analysis were used to construct a prognostic model and it was subsequently validated in a temporal validation cohort and an external validation cohort. We found total bilirubin, neutrophils, international normalised ratio and aCCI exhibited significant associations with 28-day transplant-free mortality and established a novel prognostic model, named aCCI-HBV-ACLF. The model demonstrated strong predictive performance, with area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) values of 0.859 for 28-day mortality, 0.822 for 90-day mortality. In the temporal validation cohort, aCCI-HBV-ACLF achieved area under the ROC values of 0.869 for 28-day mortality and 0.850 for 90-day mortality. In the external validation cohort, aCCI-HBV-ACLF had area under the ROC values of 0.868 for 28-day mortality and 0.888 for 90-day mortality. This study proposes a new prognostic model, which achieved excellent predictive ability for 28-/90-day transplant-free mortality rates among patients with HBV-ACLF.","2025","Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics"

Existing quantitative approaches, like radiomics and deep learning models, lack explicit quantification of intricate and subtle parenchymal structures, including fibroglandular tissue. To address this, we propose a novel topological approach that explicitly extracts multi-scale topological structures to better approximate breast parenchymal structures, and then incorporates these structures into a deep-learning-based prediction model via an attention mechanism. Our topology-informed deep learning model, TopoTxR, leverages topology to provide enhanced insights into tissues critical for disease pathophysiology and treatment response. We empirically validate TopoTxR using the VICTRE phantom breast dataset, showing that the topological structures extracted by our model effectively approximate the breast parenchymal structures. We further demonstrate TopoTxR's efficacy in predicting response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Our qualitative and quantitative analyses suggest differential topological behavior of breast tissue in treatment-naïve imaging, in patients who respond favorably to therapy as achieving pathological complete response (pCR) versus those who do not. In a comparative analysis with several baselines on the publicly available I-SPY 1 dataset (N = 161, including 47 patients with pCR and 114 without) and the Rutgers proprietary dataset (N = 120, with 69 patients achieving pCR and 51 not), TopoTxR demonstrates a notable improvement, achieving a 2.6% increase in accuracy and a 4.6% enhancement in AUC compared to the state-of-the-art method.","2025","Medical image analysis"

The authors developed a novel deep-learning language model for identifying patients with HFrEF from discharge summaries of hospitalizations with heart failure at Yale New Haven Hospital during 2015 to 2019. HFrEF was defined by left ventricular ejection fraction <40% on antecedent echocardiography. The authors externally validated the model at Northwestern Medicine, community hospitals of Yale, and the MIMIC-III (Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care III) database. A total of 13,251 notes from 5,392 unique individuals (age 73 ± 14 years, 48% women), including 2,487 patients with HFrEF (46.1%), were used for model development (train/held-out: 70%/30%).

Methods : We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane library, CNKI, VIP, and Wanfang databases for articles published before July 2024. A random-effects model was utilized to derive the summary estimates of sensitivity, specificity, and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Additionally, the sources of heterogeneity were explored by subgroup analysis and meta-regression. Results : This meta-analysis comprised 10 prospective studies involving 561 participants, of whom 241 (42.96%) were diagnosed as ICUAW. Overall, muscular ultrasound exhibited good performance for detecting ICUAW, with the area of summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curve of 0.85 (95%CI 0.82-0.88), sensitivity of 0.76 (95%CI 0.70-0.81), specificity of 0.80 (95%CI 0.74-0.84), and DOR of 12.43 (95%CI 7.98-19.38). Upon predefined subgroup analysis, the rectus femoris exhibited significantly superior discriminatory ability in identifying ICUAW than the non-rectus femoris, with higher SROC (0.88 [95%CI 0.85-0.91] vs. 0.76 [95%CI 0.72-0.79], P < 0.01). Moreover, cross-sectional area was more effective than thickness, with higher specificity (0.86 [95%CI 0.80-0.91] vs. 0.74 [95%CI 0.68-0.79], P = 0.02) and SROC (0.89 [95%CI 0.86-0.92] vs. 0.76 [95%CI 0.72-0.80], P < 0.01). Furthermore, integrated analysis of these two indicators revealed that the cross-sectional area of rectus femoris was statistically superior to the thickness of rectus femoris, with higher sensitivity (0.82 [95%CI 0.74-0.87] vs. 0.75 [95%CI 0.65-0.83], P < 0.05) and AUC (0.91 [95%CI 0.88-0.93] vs. 0.80 [95%CI 0.76-0.83], P < 0.01). Conclusions : Muscular ultrasound could be a reliable tool for ICUAW detection.

We searched PubMed, Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library databases for the studies published from inception to August 2023. Randomized controlled trials and analytical studies that investigated the incidence or risk factors of MBSH after different surgery techniques (including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, sleeve gastrectomy, gastric banding, duodenal switch, omega-loop gastric bypass, and vertical banded gastroplasty) were involved. The incidence and risk factors of MBSH were extracted and described separately based on different diagnostic criteria and then summarized the risk factors and their statistical findings collectively. Twenty-nine studies were reviewed with follow-up ranging from 1 to 22 years. The incidence of MBSH ranged significantly across different diagnostic methods: 2.6-66.4% (self-report), 6.6-61.8% (oral glucose tolerance test), 29.4-78.6% (mixed-meal tolerance test), and 50-75% (continuous glucose monitoring). Patients with a mean age of 49.8 years and 89.0% of them were women with a better glycemic control who undergo RYGB and achieve 86.5% of estimated weight loss from surgery should be particularly vigilant about the possibility of developing MBSH. Distinct biomarkers such as IGF-1 (OR 1.06), fasting glicentin (AUC 0.81), HbA1c (AUC 0.76), and absolute weight reduction (AUC 0.72), greater fluctuations in glucose (OR 1.98) are valuable in promptly detecting MBSH. Specifically, patients with prior cholecystectomy or antidepressant therapy should be particularly cautious. The review highlights higher MBSH risk in younger women with significant weight loss after RYGB, and those with prior cholecystectomy or antidepressant use. Systematic summarization of MBSH criteria allowed us to identify the predictors for MBSH, which can aid in early diagnosis and treatment, reducing the need for prolonged monitoring.","2025","International journal of obesity (2005)"

This study was conducted by evaluating 2232 patients who presented to our hospital following two major earthquakes of magnitudes 7.6 and 7.7 Mw that occurred in Kahramanmaras, Turkey, on February 6, 2023. A total of 314 patients who were hospitalized upon being rescued from the rubble and had a creatine kinase (CK) level above 1000 U/L were included in the final analysis. Factors predicting the need for RRT were investigated, and a dialysis score was developed for this prediction. Of the 314 patients included in the study, 95 (30.2 %) developed acute kidney injury (AKI). RRT was performed on 68 (21.6 %) patients. The optimal cut-off value of CK for the prediction of AKI was 23,000 U/L. Multivariate analysis revealed that factors predicting RRT were the number of traumatized sides (odds ratio [OR]: 2.2, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 1.09-4.39, p = 0.026), albumin (OR:0.11, 95 % CI: 0.04-0.32, p < 0.001), and CK (OR: 1.00, 95 % CI 1.00-1.00, p < 0.001). A dialysis score was developed ranging from 0 to 7 based on the number of traumatized sides, albumin, and CK. The area under the curve (AUC) of the dialysis score in receiver operating characteristic analysis was 0.974. A dialysis score of 4 or higher had a sensitivity of 97.1 % and a specificity of 89.4 % for predicting the need for RRT. The dialysis score predicts the need for RRT quite well. The simplicity of use and high sensitivity and specificity of this score in earthquake-related crush injuries will greatly facilitate clinicians in patient triage and follow-up.","2025","The American journal of emergency medicine"
1439,"39447001","Aggressiveness classification of clear cell renal cell carcinoma using registration-independent radiology-pathology correlation learning.","Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a common cancer that varies in clinical behavior. Clear cell RCC (ccRCC) is the most common RCC subtype, with both aggressive and indolent manifestations. Indolent ccRCC is often low-grade without necrosis and can be monitored without treatment. Aggressive ccRCC is often high-grade and can cause metastasis and death if not promptly detected and treated. While most RCCs are detected on computed tomography (CT) scans, aggressiveness classification is based on pathology images acquired from invasive biopsy or surgery. CT imaging-based aggressiveness classification would be an important clinical advance, as it would facilitate non-invasive risk stratification and treatment planning. Here, we present a novel machine learning method, Correlated Feature Aggregation By Region (CorrFABR), for CT-based aggressiveness classification of ccRCC. CorrFABR is a multimodal fusion algorithm that learns from radiology and pathology images, and clinical variables in a clinically-relevant manner. CorrFABR leverages registration-independent radiology (CT) and pathology image correlations using features from vision transformer-based foundation models to facilitate aggressiveness assessment on CT images. CorrFABR consists of three main steps: (a) Feature aggregation where region-level features are extracted from radiology and pathology images at widely varying image resolutions, (b) Fusion where radiology features correlated with pathology features (pathology-informed CT biomarkers) are learned, and (c) Classification where the learned pathology-informed CT biomarkers, together with clinical variables of tumor diameter, gender, and age, are used to distinguish aggressive from indolent ccRCC using multi-layer perceptron-based classifiers. Pathology images are only required in the first two steps of CorrFABR, and are not required in the prediction module. Therefore, CorrFABR integrates information from CT images, pathology images, and clinical variables during training, but for inference, it relies solely on CT images and clinical variables, ensuring its clinical applicability. CorrFABR was trained with heterogenous, publicly-available data from 298 ccRCC tumors (136 indolent tumors, 162 aggressive tumors) in a five-fold cross-validation setup and evaluated on an independent test set of 74 tumors with a balanced distribution of aggressive and indolent tumors. Ablation studies were performed to test the utility of each component of CorrFABR. CorrFABR outperformed the other classification methods, achieving an ROC-AUC (area under the curve) of 0.855 ± 0.0005 (95% confidence interval: 0.775, 0.947), F1-score of 0.793 ± 0.029, sensitivity of 0.741 ± 0.058, and specificity of 0.876 ± 0.032 in classifying ccRCC as aggressive or indolent subtypes. It was found that pathology-informed CT biomarkers learned through registration-independent correlation learning improves classification performance over using CT features alone, irrespective of the kind of features or the classification model used. Tumor diameter, gender, and age provide complementary clinical information, and integrating pathology-informed CT biomarkers with these clinical variables further improves performance. CorrFABR provides a novel method for CT-based aggressiveness classification of ccRCC by enabling the identification of pathology-informed CT biomarkers, and integrating them with clinical variables. CorrFABR enables learning of these pathology-informed CT biomarkers through a novel registration-independent correlation learning module that considers unaligned radiology and pathology images at widely varying image resolutions.","2025","Medical physics"

Four SIPA cut-points from the recursive partitioning were selected for each age group. SIPA was more predictive of the need for HCI. BT showed similar results consistent with previous literature. SIPA alone showed poor discrimination in relation to NFTI and mortality, and again predictive value was slightly higher in older children. While SIPA alone showed discrimination of specific outcomes of BT and HCI, it was poorly predictive of both the NFTI and mortality in children. The youngest pediatric patients continue to be elusive. Utilizing SIPA in combination with additional scores may be necessary to triage young children appropriately. This study also indicates the need to develop NFTI criteria specific to children.

The objective was to validate this pattern in concomitant CA and aortic stenosis (AS) and to identify new echocardiographic variables suggestive of CA in the presence of AS. Three hundred and twenty-four consecutive patients (age 81.5 ± 5.8 years, 51% women) with AS who underwent transcatheter aortic valve implantation (TAVI) were prospectively included. 2D speckle tracking echocardiography was performed. Following TAVI, 99mTc-DPD scintigraphy and protein electrophoresis were performed to screen for CA. Thirty-eight patients (11.7%) showed cardiac uptake in scintigraphy: 14 patients (4.3%) with Grade 1, 13 (4%) with Grade 2, and 11 (3.4%) with Grade 3. Patients with Grades 2 and 3 (AS-CA group) had more LV hypertrophy (LV mass index: 188 vs. 172 g/m2, P = 0.032), lower transvalvular aortic pressure gradient (P < 0.003), and higher prevalence of low-gradient AS (50% vs. 19%, P = 0.001), as well as greater diastolic and systolic dysfunction. Strain analysis was limited to 243 patients due to poor acoustic window and restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic (81 lost: 79 in AS alone, 1 each in AS-DPD1 and AS-CA groups). RELAPS > 1 was more prevalent in AS-CA group (74% vs. 44%, P = 0.006). An echocardiographic prediction model (GRAM score) for CA in the presence of AS, which is more sensitive and specific than RELAPS > 1 alone, is proposed using the LV mass, maximum aortic gradient, and RELAPS > 1, in addition to age (area under the curve: 0.85, 95% confidence interval: 0.77-0.93). RELAPS > 1 is more prevalent in AS-CA but can occur in almost half of AS patients without CA, which reduces its value as a screening tool. A more sensitive and specific prediction score for CA in patients with severe AS is proposed.","2025","European heart journal. Cardiovascular Imaging"

Sixty-six patients with MASLD confirmed histopathologically and 34 healthy volunteers who were age/sex-matched were prospectively enrolled in this study. ATI, SWE, and SWD examinations were performed. Fibrosis stage, necroinflammatory activity, and steatosis grade were confirmed histopathologically. Steatosis was graded as follows: S0 (<5%); S1 (5%-32%); S2 (33%-66%) to S3 (>66%). We compared the diagnostic performance of ATI, SWE, and SWD for detecting and grading hepatic steatosis. Both attenuation coefficient (AC) and SWD values were significantly different among the different hepatic steatosis, and both were correlated with hepatic steatosis. ATI had better diagnostic performance than SWD for detecting and grading hepatic steatosis. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve of ATI for detecting ≥S1, ≥S2, and =S3 were 0.917 (cut-off value of 0.69 dB/cm/MHz), 0.933 (cut-off value of 0.74 dB/cm/MHz), and 0.870 (cut-off value of 0.82 dB/cm/MHz), respectively.

Accurate diagnosis prior to treatment is essential to develop appropriate treatment strategies for poor prognosis subgroups. This study aims to enhance the accuracy of pre-treatment gastric cancer diagnosis using a biological approach centered on circulating circular RNA (circRNA). We conducted a comprehensive analysis of circRNA expression profiles using two Gene Expression Omnibus datasets to identify circRNA candidates associated with stage III gastric cancer. Subsequently, we validated these circRNA biomarkers in two independent clinical cohorts comprising a total of 174 patients with gastric cancer and non-disease controls through real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Genome-wide circRNA analysis identified a panel of four biomarkers capable of diagnosing pathologically confirmed stage III (pStage III) gastric cancer. In a training cohort (n = 83), a clinically applicable panel of four circRNAs was developed (AUC 0.81), which was successfully validated in an independent clinical cohort (n = 82; AUC 0.76). To assess clinical utility, we combined clinical imaging (cStage) with the circRNA panel. Among those initially diagnosed as cStage III but later confirmed as pStage I/II, 86% were accurately diagnosed using the molecular biological approach with circRNAs. We have developed a circRNA-based non-invasive liquid biopsy that can improve the diagnostic performance of pStage III gastric cancer before treatment. Our circRNA model could provide a sophisticated and personalized approach to assist in treatment planning for patients with advanced gastric cancer.","2025","Annals of surgical oncology"

This study aimed to develop a simple model for high-accuracy mortality risk prediction after TBI. Data from the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Trauma Quality Program (TQP) from 2019 to 2021 was used to develop a summary score based on age, the Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) component subscores, and pupillary reactivity data. We then compared the predictive accuracy to that of the Corticosteroid Randomisation After Significant Head Injury Trial (CRASH)-Basic and International Mission for Prognosis and Analysis of Clinical Trial in TBI (IMPACT)-Core models. Two separate series of sensitivity analyses were conducted to further assess our model's generalizability. We evaluated predictive performance of the models with discrimination [the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curves (AUC), sensitivity, specificity] and calibration (Brier score). Discriminative ability was compared with DeLong tests. 259,404 patients were included in the present study (mean age, 60 years; 93,495 (36 %) female). The mortality score after TBI (MOST) model (AUC = 0.875) had better discrimination (DeLong test p values < 0.00001) than CRASH-Basic (AUC = 0.837) and IMPACT-Core (AUC = 0.821) models, and superior calibration (MOST = 0.02729, CRASH-Basic = 0.02962, IMPACT-Core = 0.02962) in predicting in-hospital mortality. The MOST model similarly outperformed in predicting 3-, 7-, 14-, and 30-day mortality.

Outcomes were diagnosis of any helminthiasis and diagnosis of schistosomiasis and strongyloidiasis. Multivariable logistic regression was used to assess associations between potential predictors and helminthiases with a backwards stepwise elimination approach until a predictive model was reached in which each variable had a p value < 0.15. Of 1112 eligible patients with eosinophilia and documented stay in endemic regions, 219 (19.7%) had been diagnosed with helminthiasis, most frequently schistosomiasis (n = 95, 43.4%) and strongyloidiasis (n = 64, 29.2%).

We searched PubMed, EMBASE, and Scopus using a predefined search string. The quality assessment of included studies was conducted using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale (NOS), and the primary outcome was the mean difference (MD) in serum levels of ADM, Pro-ADM, and MR-Pro-ADM, in addition to the area under the curve (AUC). A total of 28 articles fulfilled our inclusion criteria and were included in our qualitative and quantitative synthesis, with a total of 15,405 subjects. Significant MD in ADM levels in HF patients vs. controls (6.024 [95 % CI 1.691, 10.356]), NYHA I vs. controls (-1.202 [95 % CI -2.111, -0.292]), NYHA IV vs. controls (-7.536 [95 % CI -12.680, -2.393]), NYHA III vs. NYHA IV (-4.438 [95 % CI -7.612, -1.263]), and NYHA I-II vs NYHA III-IV (-2.351 [95 % CI -4.361, -0.341]) were observed.

In total, 180 patients with suspected ATTR amyloidosis underwent 99mTc-PYP scintigraphy in participating institutions in Japan between January 2018 and July 2022. Of 135 patients included in the analysis, 62 were 99mTc-PYP-positive. Logistic regression analysis was performed, and the following five factors were adopted to create a scoring system, with each weighted according to its odds ratio value; 1 point was scored for the absence of hypertension, existence of peripheral entrapment neuropathy (carpal tunnel syndrome or spinal canal stenosis), conduction disturbance (the presence of QRS complex ≥120 ms, first-degree atrioventricular block, higher degree of atrioventricular block, or presence of pacemaker implantation), and left ventricular hypertrophy and 2 points for troponin I/T ≥ 0.06 ng/mL. 99mTc-PYP scintigraphy positivity rate in the 0-point group was 0 %, whereas that in the 6-point group was 100 %. The area under the curve of the criteria was 0.820 (95 % confidence interval, 0.752-0.888; P < 0.001). The combination of clinical information, which is easily available in local clinics, can provide accurate pretest prediction of positive 99mTc-PYP scintigraphy results.

Dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in response to stress has been implicated in depression. Here, we estimated annual exposure to particulate matter (PM) from diesel emissions in 170 9- to 15-year-old adolescents (56 % female) using their residential addresses and data from nearby monitoring sites. We obtained salivary cortisol samples from participants while they completed a social stress task and calculated area under the curve with respect to ground (AUCg) and with respect to increase (AUCi) in order to assess cortisol responsivity during stress. Participants also reported on their depressive symptoms and sleep disturbances. Greater exposure to diesel PM was associated with lower cortisol output (AUCg) during stress, which was associated with higher depressive symptoms, particularly for adolescents with more sleep disturbances. Importantly, these effects were independent of household and neighborhood socioeconomic disadvantage and exposure to early adversity. Thus, HPA-axis dysfunction may be one mechanism through which environmental pollutants affect adolescents' mental health.","2025","Psychoneuroendocrinology"

Genetic factors may play a role and warrant exploration. The aim of this study was to elucidate genetic variants modulating the impact of alcohol consumption on insulin sensitivity and pancreatic beta cell function within populations presenting normal glucose tolerance (NGT). We recruited 4194 volunteers in Nanjing, 854 in Jurong and an additional 5833 in Nanjing for Discovery cohorts 1 and 2 and a Validation cohort, respectively. We performed an OGTT on all participants, establishing a stringent NGT group, and then assessed insulin sensitivity and beta cell function. Alcohol consumption was categorised as abstinent, light-to-moderate (<210 g per week) or heavy (≥210 g per week). After excluding ineligible individuals, an exploratory genome-wide association study identified potential variants interacting with alcohol consumption in 1862 NGT individuals. These findings were validated in an additional cohort of 2169 NGT individuals. Cox proportional hazard regression was further employed to evaluate the effect of the interaction between the potential variants and alcohol consumption on the risk of type 2 diabetes within the UK Biobank cohort. A significant correlation was observed between drinking levels and insulin sensitivity, accompanied by a consequent inverse relationship with insulin resistance and beta cell insulin secretion after adjusting for confounding factors in NGT individuals. However, no significant associations were noted in the disposition indexes. The interaction of variant rs56221195 with alcohol intake exhibited a pronounced effect on the liver insulin resistance index (LIRI) in the discovery set, corroborated in the validation set (combined p=1.32 × 10-11). Alcohol consumption did not significantly affect LIRI in rs56221195 wild-type (TT) carriers, but a strong negative association emerged in heterozygous (TA) and homozygous (AA) individuals. The rs56221195 variant also significantly interacts with alcohol consumption, influencing the total insulin secretion index INSR120 (the ratio of the AUC of insulin to glucose from 0 to 120 min) (p=2.06 × 10-9) but not disposition index. In the UK Biobank, we found a significant interaction between rs56221195 and alcohol consumption, which was linked to the risk of type 2 diabetes (HR 0.897, p=0.008).

While oncologists typically use tumor grading scores, such as tumor regression grade (TRG), to establish an accurate prognosis on patient outcomes, including overall survival (OS) and time-to-recurrence (TTR), these traditional methods have several limitations. They are subjective, time-consuming, and require extensive expertise, which limits their scalability and reliability. Additionally, existing approaches for prognosis prediction using machine learning mostly rely on radiological imaging data, but recently histological images have been shown to be relevant for survival predictions by allowing to fully capture the complex microenvironmental and cellular characteristics of the tumor. To address these limitations, we propose an end-to-end approach for automated prognosis prediction using histology slides stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) and Hematoxylin Phloxine Saffron (HPS). We first employ a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) for slide normalization to reduce staining variations and improve the overall quality of the images that are used as input to our prediction pipeline. We propose a semi-supervised model to perform tissue classification from sparse annotations, producing segmentation and feature maps. Specifically, we use an attention-based approach that weighs the importance of different slide regions in producing the final classification results. Finally, we exploit the extracted features for the metastatic nodules and surrounding tissue to train a prognosis model. In parallel, we train a vision Transformer model in a knowledge distillation framework to replicate and enhance the performance of the prognosis prediction. We evaluate our approach on an in-house clinical dataset of 258 CLM patients, achieving superior performance compared to other comparative models with a c-index of 0.804 (0.014) for OS and 0.735 (0.016) for TTR, as well as on two public datasets. The proposed approach achieves an accuracy of 86.9% to 90.3% in predicting TRG dichotomization. For the 3-class TRG classification task, the proposed approach yields an accuracy of 78.5% to 82.1%, outperforming the comparative methods. Our proposed pipeline can provide automated prognosis for pathologists and oncologists, and can greatly promote precision medicine progress in managing CLM patients.","2025","Medical image analysis"

This open-label, multi-arm, single-site, parallel-group controlled trial involved a 6 day stay at the University of South Australia's sleep laboratory (Adelaide, SA, Australia). Healthy, non-shift-working adults without obesity (N=55; age 24.5 ± 4.8 years; BMI 24.8 ± 2.8 kg/m2) were assigned to the next available run date and cluster randomised (1:1:1) to fasting-at-night (N=20), snack-at-night (N=17), or meal-at-night (N=18) conditions. One participant withdrew from each group, prior to starting the study. Due to study design, neither participants nor people collecting their measurements could be blinded. Statistical and laboratory staff were concealed to study allocation. Participants were fed at calculated energy balance, with the macronutrient composition of meals being similar across conditions. The primary outcomes were a linear mixed-effects model of glucose, insulin and NEFA AUC in response to a 75 g OGTT that was conducted prior to and after 4 consecutive nights of shift work plus 1 night of recovery sleep. Insulin sensitivity, insulinogenic and disposition indexes were also calculated. Night-shift work impaired insulin sensitivity, as measured by insulin AUC (p=0.035) and the insulin sensitivity index (p=0.016) across all conditions. Insulin secretion, as measured by the insulinogenic index, was increased in the fasting-at-night condition only (p=0.030), resulting in a day×condition interaction in glucose AUC (p<0.001) such that glucose tolerance was impaired in the meal-at night (+2.00 [95% CI 1.45, 2.56], p<0.001) and snack at-night (+0.96 [0.36, 1.56], p=0.022) conditions vs the fasting-at-night (+0.34 [-0.21, 0.89]) condition.

(1) STAR will reach an acceptable predictive threshold in the assessment of overuse injury in youth athletes. (2) Higher STAR scores will be associated with increased RTP time periods after injury. Longitudinal cohort study. Level 3. Youth athletes with an injury sustained during competitive sport completed questionnaires. Association of questionnaire variables with injury risk type was evaluated via logistic regression analyses, and unweighted and weighted versions of a total risk score were developed. RTP was defined by physician clearance per electronic medical record review. Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests and Kendall's rank correlation coefficients were used to assess the relationship between weighted total risk score and RTP time periods. The weighted STAR model was analyzed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves. The weighted STAR model trended toward an acceptable level of prediction for overuse (nonserious + serious) injury (area under the ROC curve [AUC], 0.66; 95% CI, 0.61-0.71), but was less predictive for serious overuse injury (AUC, 0.63; 95% CI, 0.55-0.71). Weighted total risk score was weakly associated with return to full play (ρ = 0.11; P < 0.01), and potentially with return to modified play (ρ = -0.08; P = 0.04). STAR may be a feasible tool for assessing overuse injury risk and RTP time periods in youth athletes but requires further development, as it did not reach an acceptable predictive threshold in this preliminary study.

Among 200 included individuals (57% female, median 51 years), 62 had relevant neoplasia at colonoscopy: 3 CRC, 6 advanced adenoma (AA), 3 advanced serrated lesion (ASL), and 50 non-advanced adenoma (NAA). Respective sensitivity and negative predictive value for CRC and AA (and also ASL in case of FAIMS) were 100% and 100% using FAIMS (54% specificity), and 89% and 99% using GC-IMS (58% specificity). Respective sensitivity and specificity for any relevant neoplasia were 88% and 44% (FAIMS) and 84% and 28% (GC-IMS); accuracy did not significantly improve upon VOC-FIT. VOC-patterns differed before and after polypectomy (AUC 0.70). NAA showed decreased faecal abundance of butanal, 2-oxohexane, dimethyldisulphide and dimethyltrisulphide.

Aerobic fitness (VO2peak) and body weight were assessed. After an overnight fast, whole-body glucose tolerance (total area under the curve, tAUC) and insulin sensitivity (SIis) were determined from a 120 min 75 g OGTT. nEVs were acquired from 0 and 60 min time-points of the OGTT, and levels of insulin signaling proteins (i.e., p-IRS-1, total-/p-Akt, pERK1/2, pJNK1/2, and pp38) and pro-BNDF were measured. OGTT stimulatory effects were calculated from protein differences (i.e., OGTT 60-0 min). Adults were collapsed into a single group as exercise intensity did not affect nEV outcomes. Exercise raised VO2peak (+1.4 ± 2.0 mL/kg/min, p = 0.008) and insulin sensitivity (p = 0.01) as well as decreased weight (-0.4 ± 0.9 kg, p = 0.04) and whole-body glucose tAUC120min (p = 0.02). Training lowered 0-min pro-BDNF (704.1 ± 1019.0 vs. 414.5 ± 533.5, p = 0.04) and increased OGTT-stimulated tAkt (-51.8 ± 147.2 vs. 95 ± 204.5 a.u., p = 0.01), which was paralleled by reduced pAkt/tAkt at 60 min of the OGTT (1.3 ± 0.2 vs. 1.2 ± 0.1 a.u., p = 0.04). Thus, 2 weeks of exercise altered neuronal insulin signaling responses to glucose ingestion and lowered pro-BNDF among adults with prediabetes, thereby potentially lowering ADRD risk.","2025","Aging cell"

This study included 99 patients treated with esophagectomy after NACRT between March 2010 and October 2021 whose blood samples were collected between the end of NACRT and surgery. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) was used to analyze sRNAs from the blood samples. A predictive model for pCR comprising micro-RNA isoforms (isomiR), transfer RNA (tRNA)-derived sRNAs (tsRNAs), and clinical factors was constructed using cross-validation. Of the 99 patients, pCR was diagnosed for 30 and non-pCR for 69 of the patients. Among sRNAs, the isomiRs of let-7b and miR-93 and the tsRNA group derived from tRNA-Gly-CCC/GCC were identified as predictive factors. The clinical factors included a decrease in the maximum standardized uptake value (SUVmax) at the primary site, clinical complete response post-NACRT, preoperative biopsy, and post-NACRT carcinoembryonic antigen levels. The combined predictive model for pCR (C-PM) was established using the three sRNAs and four clinical factors. The area under the curve for the C-PM was 0.84, which was a significant factor in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio, 89.41; 95 % confidence interval 8.1-987.5; p < 0.001). Pathologic complete response after NACRT can be predicted by a predictive model constructed from preoperative clinical factors obtained via minimally invasive procedures and sRNA identified by NGS. Preoperative pCR prediction may influence treatment decision-making after NACRT.","2025","Annals of surgical oncology"

We show the development and validation of a method for measuring 3-OMD from dried plasma samples (DPS) and plasma using liquid chromatography coupled with high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) on a Thermo Fisher Scientific Orbitrap Exploris 120. The method was accurate and reproducible in the range 7.8-4000 ng/mL, from small amounts (50 mL) of plasma and DPS (obtained starting from 30 mL plasma). 3-OMD concentrations measured in plasma and DPS were highly correlated (R = 0.99 95 %CI 0.993-0.996). Differences of 3-OMD levels across stages L1 and M and L1 and L2 (p-value < 0.05) were statistically significant.

Early detection and a comprehensive understanding of tumor-immune interactions are crucial for improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to develop a novel biomarker panel utilizing peripheral blood transcriptomics and machine learning algorithms for early lung cancer diagnosis, while simultaneously providing insights into tumor-immune crosstalk mechanisms. Leveraging a training cohort (GSE135304), we employed multiple machine learning algorithms to formulate a Lung Cancer Diagnostic Score (LCDS) based on peripheral blood transcriptomic features. The LCDS model's performance was evaluated using the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) in multiple validation cohorts (GSE42834, GSE157086, and an in-house dataset). Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 20 lung cancer patients and 10 healthy control subjects, representing an in-house cohort recruited at the Sixth People's Hospital of Chengdu. We employed advanced bioinformatics techniques to explore tumor-immune interactions through comprehensive immune infiltration and pathway enrichment analyses. Initial screening identified 844 differentially expressed genes, which were subsequently refined to 87 genes using the Boruta feature selection algorithm. The random forest (RF) algorithm demonstrated the highest accuracy in constructing the LCDS model, yielding a mean AUC of 0.938. Lower LCDS values were significantly associated with elevated immune scores and increased CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell infiltration, indicative of enhanced antitumor-immune responses. Higher LCDS scores correlated with activation of hypoxia, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), and Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling pathways, as well as reduced DNA damage repair pathway scores. Our study presents a novel, machine learning-derived peripheral blood transcriptomic biomarker panel with potential applications in early lung cancer diagnosis. The LCDS model not only demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing lung cancer patients from healthy individuals but also offers valuable insights into tumor-immune interactions and underlying cancer biology. This approach may facilitate early lung cancer detection and contribute to a deeper understanding of the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying tumor-immune crosstalk. Furthermore, our findings on the relationship between LCDS and immune infiltration patterns may have implications for future research on therapeutic strategies targeting the immune system in lung cancer.","2025","BioFactors (Oxford, England)"

NHHR, calculated as (total cholesterol - HDL-C)/HDL-C, was evaluated in 10,188 participants. Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed to assess the association of NHHR with future risk of MACEs and overall mortality. Restricted cubic spline analysis, smooth curve fitting and piecewise regression models were utilized to explore the non-linear correlation and establish the threshold. Subgroup and interaction analyses verified the robustness of the findings. The area under the receiver operating characteristic area under the curve assessed the additional predictive value of NHHR beyond conventional risk factors. After adjusting for confounding factors, each 1-unit increase in NHHR was associated with a 12% increased risk of MACEs (hazard ratio [HR]: 1.12, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07-1.16; p < 0.0001), a 5% increase in overall mortality (HR: 1.05, 95% CI: 1.01-1.10; p = 0.0256), a 10% increase in cardiovascular disease mortality (HR 1.10, 95% CI: 1.03-1.18; p = 0.0074), an 12% increase in non-fatal myocardial infarction (HR: 1.12, 95% CI: 1.05-1.18; p = 0.0002), and an 11% increase in non-fatal stroke (HR: 1.11, 95% CI: 1.02-1.20; p = 0.0123). Analyses showed a non-linear relationship between NHHR and MACEs in patients with T2DM (non-linearity p < 0.001). A two-stage linear regression model identified a threshold for MACEs at 6.28. Integration NHHR into the conventional model significantly enhanced predictive accuracy for MACEs. NHHR is a predictor of the risk of developing MACEs and overall mortality in patients with T2DM, with higher NHHR values independently associated with increased future MACE risks after full adjustment for confounders.","2025","Diabetes, obesity & metabolism"

After at least 4 cycles neoadjuvant therapy, all the patients received US and CEUS examinations within two weeks before hepatectomy. CEUS clips were postprocessed with color parameter imaging (CPI) and microflow imaging (MFI) analysis. Logistic regression analyses were used to develop an evaluation Nomogram. Ultrasound-based model was constructed to discriminate between the response (TRG1/2/3) and nonresponse (TRG4/5) groups at the lesion level. The model's predictive ability was evaluated using the C index and calibration curve, with decision curve analysis assessing the Nomogram's added value. The study analyzed 105 CRLM lesions (the lesion with the highest diameter analyzed for each patient), with 43.8% showing a response to therapy. Univariate analysis identified calcification on US (p = 0.039), CEUS enhancement degree (p < 0.001), CEUS enhancement pattern (p<0.001), CEUS washout type (p < 0.001), CEUS necrosis (p < 0.001), CPI feeding artery (p = 0.003) and MFI pattern (p < 0.001) were significantly associated with TRG.

To evaluate the psychometric properties of the Taiwanese version of the Wijma delivery expectancy/experience questionnaire version A (WDEQ-A) in pregnant women. We conducted a cross-sectional study with pregnant women, using the WDEQ-A and a Visual Analogue Scale to assess childbirth fear. We employed the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale to measure depressive symptoms, anxiety, and mindfulness, respectively. We evaluated internal consistency reliability and construct validity using exploratory factor analysis and Rasch analysis. Pearson correlations measured the association between childbirth fear and psychological variables. The receiver operating characteristic curve was used for determining the sensitivity and specificity indices. The WDEQ-A demonstrated excellent reliability (Cronbach's alpha = 0.93) and revealed a three-factor structure, including fear, lack of positive anticipation, and isolation. Rasch analysis supported the dimensionality of each of the three revised factors. The total score significantly correlated with depression (r = 0.56), anxiety (r = 0.19), and mindfulness (r = -0.40) (Ps < 0.001). The optimal cut-off for WDEQ-A was established at 55.5, with a sensitivity of 83 % and a specificity of 65 %. The Taiwanese version of WDEQ-A proved to be a reliable and valid tool for assessing fear of childbirth in pregnant women, demonstrating excellent psychometric properties. These findings can assist midwives in Taiwan in identifying and promptly providing effective strategies for women experiencing a high fear of childbirth.","2025","Midwifery"

MRI radiomics has been explored for three-tiered classification of HER2 expression levels (i.e., HER2-zero, HER2-low, or HER2-positive) in patients with breast cancer, although an understanding of how such models reach their predictions is lacking. OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to develop and test multiparametric MRI radiomics machine learning models for differentiating three-tiered HER2 expression levels in patients with breast cancer, as well as to explain the contributions of model features through local and global interpretations with the use of Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) analysis. METHODS. This retrospective study included 737 patients (mean age, 54.1 ± 10.6 [SD] years) with breast cancer from two centers (center 1 [n = 578] and center 2 [n = 159]), all of whom underwent multiparametric breast MRI and had HER2 expression determined after excisional biopsy. Analysis entailed two tasks: differentiating HER2-negative (i.e., HER2-zero or HER2-low) tumors from HER2-positive tumors (task 1) and differentiating HER2-zero tumors from HER2-low tumors (task 2). For each task, patients from center 1 were randomly assigned in a 7:3 ratio to a training set (task 1: n = 405; task 2: n = 284) or an internal test set (task 1: n = 173; task 2: n = 122); patients from center 2 formed an external test set (task 1: n = 159; task 2: n = 105). Radiomic features were extracted from early phase dynamic contrast-enhanced (DCE) imaging, T2-weighted imaging, and DWI. For each task, a support vector machine (SVM) was used for feature selection, a multiparametric radiomics score (radscore) was computed using feature weights from SVM correlation coefficients, conventional MRI and combined models were constructed, and model performances were evaluated. SHAP analysis was used to provide local and global interpretations of the model outputs. RESULTS. In the external test set, for task 1, AUCs for the conventional MRI model, radscore, and the combined model were 0.624, 0.757, and 0.762, respectively; for task 2, the AUC for radscore was 0.754, and no conventional MRI model or combined model could be constructed. SHAP analysis identified early phase DCE imaging features as having the strongest influence for both tasks; T2-weighted imaging features also had a prominent role for task 2. CONCLUSION. The findings indicate suboptimal performance of MRI radiomics models for noninvasive characterization of HER2 expression. CLINICAL IMPACT. The study provides an example of the use of SHAP interpretation analysis to better understand predictions of imaging-based machine learning models.","2025","AJR. American journal of roentgenology"

This study aims to analyze the prevalence and risk factors of CHE to identify high-risk patients who would benefit from therapeutic interventions. This single-center, retrospective observational study included 126 patients without a history of overt hepatic encephalopathy (OHE). CHE was defined as a score above the age-based cutoff value in the Stroop test. Factors associated with the occurrence of CHE and the subsequent development of OHE were evaluated. CHE was detected in 47 patients (37.3%). A multiple logistic regression analysis identified serum zinc levels (per + 1 µg/dL, odds ratio 0.95, P = 0.0007) as the only risk factor associated with CHE, with a cutoff value of 60 µg/dL (AUC 0.71, P = 0.0001). Neither blood ammonia levels nor liver function were predictive of CHE. During a median observation period of 211 days, OHE developed in 18 patients (14.3%). The administration of more than 20 mg of furosemide was identified as a risk factor for developing OHE (hazard ratio 23.52, P = 0.0207). Cirrhotic patients with serum zinc levels below 60 µg/dL exhibit a high risk of developing CHE, regardless of blood ammonia levels. These patients face a significant risk of developing OHE. Therefore, early zinc supplementation is recommended for the prevention of OHE, particularly for those prescribed 20 mg or more of furosemide.","2025","Journal of gastroenterology"

Eleven studies and 16 prediction models were included, with sample sizes ranging from 108 to 803,124 cases and outcome event incidences between 5.2% and 50.0%. The four most frequently included predictors in the models were length of stay, hypertension, age, and functional disability. Twelve models reported an area under the curve (AUC) ranging from 0.520 to 0.940, and five models provided calibration metrics. Only one model included both internal and external validation, while six models had internal validation. Eleven studies were found to have a high risk of bias (ROB), predominantly in the area of data analysis. This systematic review included 16 readmission prediction models for stroke, which generally exhibited good predictive performance and can effectively identify high-risk patients likely to be readmitted. However, the generalizability of these models remains uncertain due to methodological limitations. Rather than developing new readmission prediction models for stroke, the focus should shift toward external validation and the iterative adaptation of existing models.

Neuroinflammation and systemic inflammatory responses significantly contribute to secondary brain injury following ICH. Post-surgery SIRS is known to worsen clinical outcomes in ICH patients; however, the immune response in the CSF and PB has not been fully characterized. Understanding immunological changes in ICH patients with SIRS could lead to improved clinical management and prognostic outcomes. This study involved a retrospective analysis of data from patients with ICH who underwent surgery in the Neurological Intensive Care Unit (NICU) of Baoding No. 1 Hospital, Hebei Province, China, between January and July 2022. Patients were divided into SIRS and non-SIRS groups based on the clinical criteria. Demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, including lymphocyte subsets in CSF and PB, were collected and analyzed. This study compared lymphocyte subsets and other inflammatory markers between the SIRS and non-SIRS groups. Patients with SIRS demonstrated higher systolic blood pressure (SBP) at admission, worse 90-day prognoses, elevated inflammatory markers, increased levels of complement proteins C3 and C4, and lower levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) compared to patients without SIRS. Between 3-6 days post-surgery, SIRS patients showed higher percentages of CD3+T cells, CD4+T cells, and CD4+/CD8+ ratios in the CSF than non-SIRS patients. CD3+T cell percentages in the CSF were consistently higher than those in the PB and were independent of PB levels. In contrast, CD3-CD16+CD56+ natural killer (NK) cell percentages were lower in patients with SIRS. No significant differences in PB lymphocyte subsets were found between the two groups. A high CSF CD3+T cell percentage (≥85.68 %) was identified as the strongest predictor of critical ICH with SIRS after surgery, with an appropriate use criterion (AUC) of 0.7742, sensitivity of 77.42 %, specificity of 76.19 %, and 95 % CI of 0.6655-0.8829 (P < 0.0001). Elevated levels of CD3+T lymphocytes in CSF are strongly associated with an increased risk of severe cerebral hemorrhage and SIRS following surgery. These findings suggest that monitoring CSF immune markers, particularly CD3+T lymphocytes, could serve as valuable predictors for the development of SIRS in critically ill ICH patients and inform post-surgical treatment strategies.","2025","Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry"

Evaluate the ability for uncertainty proxies to quantify LLM confidence when performing diagnosis and treatment selection tasks by assessing the properties of discrimination and calibration. We examined confidence elicitation (CE), token-level probability (TLP), and sample consistency (SC) proxies across GPT3.5, GPT4, Llama2, and Llama3. Uncertainty proxies were evaluated against 3 datasets of open-ended patient scenarios. SC discrimination outperformed TLP and CE methods.

SC by GPT annotation achieved the second-best discrimination (ROC AUC 0.66-0.74) with accurate calibration. Verbalized confidence (CE) was found to consistently overestimate model confidence. SC is the most effective method for estimating LLM uncertainty of the proxies evaluated. SC by sentence embedding can effectively estimate uncertainty if the user has a set of reference cases with which to re-calibrate their results, while SC by GPT annotation is the more effective method if the user does not have reference cases and requires accurate raw calibration.

The study enrolled 517 patients with Chagas cardiomyopathy who were referred to our institution from March 2000 to December 2021. All patients underwent systematic cardiological and neurological assessments. The primary outcome was the occurrence of ischemic stroke during the follow-up period, classified based on the SSS-TOAST and CCS criteria. Natural cubic splines functions were applied to examine the potential nonlinear association between continuous variables and stroke risk. The mean age of the cohort was 52 ± 13 years, and 299 (58 %) were men. During a mean follow-up period of 4.8 years (interquartile range-IQR 1.1 to 7.1 years), a total of 72 patients (14.8 %) had an ischemic stroke, being fatal in 10. The overall incidence rate of ischemic stroke was 3.0/100 patient-years (95 % confidence interval 2.4 to 3.8). The stroke subtypes were cardioembolic (n = 41), undetermined (n = 11), and other subtypes (n = 20). The predictors of stroke were age, left atrial volume, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), LV thrombus and prior stroke with thrombus. There was a nonlinear relationship between stroke risk, LVEF, and left atrial volume. A bimodal distribution of stroke occurrences was observed according to the severity of LV dysfunction, with a threshold for LVEF of 45 %. The final model for stroke risk prediction showed good discrimination, with a C statistic of 0.775.

The present study aimed to explore the prognostic value of LACI in patients with light-chain (AL) amyloidosis. We prospectively enrolled 179 patients with AL amyloidosis who underwent cardiovascular magnetic resonance imaging between December 2011 and January 2020. LACI was defined as the ratio between the left atrial volume and the left ventricular volume at end-diastole. The primary endpoint was all-cause mortality. Receiver operating characteristic curve was used to identify the optimal cut-off of LACI in predicting all-cause mortality. Univariable and multivariable Cox proportional hazard models were used to assess the association of LACI and primary endpoint. During a median follow-up of 30 months, 118 (65.9 %) patients with all-cause mortality were documented. LACI was significantly higher in patients with primary endpoint compared to those without primary endpoint (55.4 %, interquartile range: 31.6 %-71.5 % vs. 39.4 %, interquartile range: 24.1 %-54.7 %, p = 0.001). The optimal cut-off for LACI to predict mortality was 49.3 %. In multivariate Cox regression analysis, LACI≥49.3 % (HR 1.907, 95 % CI 1.273-2.857, p = 0.002) was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality. On Kaplan-Meier analysis, patients at advanced Mayo stage (IIIa and IIIb) can be further risk stratified using LACI≥49.3 % (log-rank p = 0.035, p = 0.025). The LACI provides powerful independent prognostic value in AL amyloidosis. The LACI has incremental prognostic value to predict all-cause mortality over the Mayo stage in patients at the advanced Mayo stage.","2025","International journal of cardiology"

A total of 4371 patients underwent US and SE with BI-RADS 2-5 categories solid breast lesions were included from 32 hospitals. We evaluated the elastographic images according to elasticity scores (ES) and strain ratios (SR). Three combined methods (BI-RADS + ES, BI-RADS + SR, BI-RADS + ES + SR) and two reclassified methods were used (method one: upgrading BI-RADS 3 and downgrading BI-RADS 4a, method two: downgrading BI-RADS 4a alone). The diagnostic performance and the potential reduction of unnecessary biopsies were evaluated. Combining BI-RADS with SE had a higher area under the curve (AUC) than BI-RADS alone (0.822-0.898 vs 0.794, P < .01). For reclassified method one, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 99.36%, 66.70%, 78.36% for BI-RADS + ES and 98.01%, 66.45%, 77.72% for BI-RADS + SR, and 99.42%, 66.70%, 78.38% for BI-RADS + ES + SR, respectively. For reclassified method two, the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy were 99.17%, 70.72%, 80.87% for BI-RADS + ES and 97.76%, 81.75%, 87.46% for BI-RADS + SR, and 99.23%, 69.83%, 80.32% for BI-RADS + ES + SR, respectively. Downgrading BI-RADS 4a alone had higher AUC, specificity, and accuracy (P < .01) and similar sensitivity (P > .05) to upgrading BI-RADS 3 and downgrading BI-RADS 4a. Combining SE with BI-RADS could help reduce unnecessary biopsies by 17.64%-55.20%. Combining BI-RADS with SE improved the diagnostic performance in distinguishing benign from malignant lesions and could decrease false-positive breast biopsy rates. Downgrading BI-RADS 4a lesions alone might be sufficient for achieving good diagnostic performance.

We sought to determine whether a shorter, novel tool based on existing, validated surveys could better capture differences in a sample of orthopaedic oncology patients. (1) Can a concise fixed-item functional tool derived from the 50 items in the Toronto Extremity Salvage Score for the lower extremity (TESS LE) and the Lower Extremity Functional Scale (LEFS) demonstrate similar responsiveness in terms of sensitivity and specificity? (2) What is the precision and accuracy of the concise tool compared with the TESS LE and LEFS? Functional outcome data were collected and maintained in a longitudinally maintained database at a single institution. Patients were included in the study if (1) they had undergone a tumor excision or a nononcologic orthopaedic procedure (for example, arthroplasty for osteoarthritis) for a bone or soft tissue tumor affecting lower extremity function, and (2) they had completed the LEFS, TESS LE, and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) global health tool on at least two clinic visits. Between September 2014 and April 2022, we treated 14,234 patients for primary bone or soft tissue sarcoma, metastatic disease to bone, or orthopaedic sequelae of chronic cancer care. Approximately 6% (854 of 14,234) were excluded due to the need of a language translator. Approximately 2% (278 of 13,380) refused or were unable to participate. Seventy-two percent (9433 of 13,102) of the patients had an operation on a lower extremity. Of these, 4% (339 of 9433) of the patients completed the TESS LE, LEFS, and Item 3 of the PROMIS global health tool on ≥ 2 clinic visits. Of the patients in the current study, 49% (167 of 339) were women, and 27% (93 of 339) had metastatic carcinoma. Twelve percent (41 of 339) of the patients died before the end of the study period. Spearman rank-order correlation, principal component analysis (PCA), and item response theory (IRT) modeling identified 14 highly discriminating items from the TESS LE and LEFS. Multiple linear stepwise regression (MLSR) was performed with the dependent variable being the summary score of the 14 items derived from the TESS LE and LEFS and standardized to a percentage of 100. The beta coefficient from the MLSR was used to derive a weight for each of the 14 items. Evaluation of the model with 10 to 17 variables was performed to ensure that the model with the 14 items met the most criteria for fit with the PCA, the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, and the IRT modeling criteria. The responsiveness (sensitivity and specificity) of the change scores in the shortened 14-item survey, the 30-item TESS LE, and the 20-item LEFS as compared with the dichotomized changes in Item 3 of the PROMIS global health tool was evaluated using ROCs. The concordance (accuracy and precision) of the 14 items derived from the LEFS and TESS LE was evaluated. The responsiveness (sensitivity and specificity) of the shortened 14-item survey, the TESS LE, and the LEFS to the criterion target of the PROMIS global health tool (Item 3) was similar, with areas under the curve (AUCs) ranging from 0.62 to 0.65 for the ROC curves. The responsiveness of the 14-item survey to the TESS LE showed sensitivity of 96% and specificity of 90%, with an AUC of 0.98 (p < 0.001). The responsiveness of the 14 items to the LEFS showed sensitivity of 95% and specificity of 86%, with an AUC of 0.96. The validity of the 14 items to the TESS LE was measured by concordance, with a precision of 0.98 and an accuracy of 0.97. Concordance of the 14 items to the LEFS showed a precision of 0.98 and accuracy of 0.83. The concise 14 items derived from patient-reported responses in the TESS LE and LEFS outcome measures showed similar responsiveness (sensitivity and specificity) as the original TESS LE and LEFS for cancer patients after lower extremity orthopaedic surgery performed for oncologic and nononcologic indications. The concise 14 items have a similar ability to the TESS LE and LEFS to tell the clinician or patient how they are functioning compared with other patients. These 14 items are shorter than the combined 50 items of the TESS LE and LEFS while retaining the capacity to describe a broad range of lower extremity function for orthopaedic oncology patients.

Clinical experience suggests that they may share common risk factors and associations. When one organ experiences prolapse, it can potentially affect the neighboring organs. However, the current assessment of disease severity still relies on manual measurements, which can yield varying results depending on the physician, thereby leading to diagnostic inaccuracies. This study aims to develop a multilabel grading model based on deep learning to classify the degree of prolapse of three organs in the female pelvis using stress magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and provide interpretable result analysis. We utilized sagittal MRI sequences taken at rest and during maximum Valsalva maneuver from 662 subjects. The training set included 464 subjects, the validation set included 98 subjects, and the test set included 100 subjects (training set n = 464, validation set n = 98, test set n = 100). We designed a feature extraction module specifically for pelvic floor MRI using the vision transformer architecture and employed label masking training strategy and pre-training methods to enhance model convergence. The grading results were evaluated using Precision, Kappa, Recall, and Area Under the Curve (AUC). To validate the effectiveness of the model, the designed model was compared with classic grading methods. Finally, we provided interpretability charts illustrating the model's operational principles on the grading task. In terms of POP grading detection, the model achieved an average Precision, Kappa coefficient, Recall, and AUC of 0.86, 0.77, 0.76, and 0.86, respectively. Compared to existing studies, our model achieved the highest performance metrics. The average time taken to diagnose a patient was 0.38 s. The proposed model achieved detection accuracy that is comparable to or even exceeds that of physicians, demonstrating the effectiveness of the vision transformer architecture and label masking training strategy for assisting in the grading of POP under static and maximum Valsalva conditions. This offers a promising option for computer-aided diagnosis and treatment planning of POP.","2025","Medical physics"

We employed the Extreme Gradient Boosting machine learning classifier to predict long-term FN outcomes (classified as House-Brackmann grades 1-2 for good outcomes and 3-6 for bad outcomes) after VS surgery. In a retrospective analysis of 256 patients, comprehensive pre-, intra-, and post-operative factors were examined. We applied the machine learning (ML) classifier Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) for the following binary classification: long-term good and bad FN outcome after VS surgery To enhance the interpretability of our model, we utilized an explainable artificial intelligence approach. Short-term FN function (tau = 0.6) correlated with long-term FN function. The model exhibited an average accuracy of 0.83, a ROC AUC score of 0.91, and Matthew's correlation coefficient score of 0.62. The most influential feature, identified through SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), was short-term FN function. Conversely, large tumor volume and absence of preoperative auditory brainstem responses were associated with unfavorable outcomes. We introduce an effective ML model for classifying long-term FN outcomes following VS surgery. Short-term FN function was identified as the key predictor of long-term function. This model's excellent ability to differentiate bad and good outcomes makes it useful for evaluating patients and providing recommendations regarding FN dysfunction management.","2025","Journal of neuro-oncology"

We validated the SALT-M score in a large-volume, Asian single-centre cohort. We validated the SALT-M score in a large-volume, Asian single-centre cohort. We analysed 224 patients of ACLF grade 2-3. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and concordance index (c-index) were used to assess and compare the predictability of posttransplant mortality of SALT-M and other scores. Moreover, we compared the survivals of patients with high and low SALT-M, in conjunction with MELD score and ACLF grade. The AUROC for prediction of 1-year post-LT survival was higher in SALT-M (0.691) than in MELD, MELD-Na, MELD 3.0 and delta-MELD. Similarly, the c-index of the SALT-M (0.650) was higher than aforementioned MELD systems. When categorised by the cut-off of SALT-M ≥ 20 and MELD ≥ 30, patients with high SALT-M exhibited lower post-LT survival than those with low SALT-M scores regardless of high or low MELD (40.0% for high SALT-M/high MELD vs. 42.9% for high SALT-M/low MELD vs. 73.8% for low SALT-M/high MELD vs. 63.7% for low SALT-M/low MELD, p < 0.001). In patients with ACLF grade 3, SALT-M effectively stratified the posttransplant mortality (39.4% for high SALT-M vs. 63.1% for low SALT-M, p = 0.018). SALT-M outperformed previous MELD systems for predicting posttransplant mortality in Asian LT cohort with severe ACLF. Transplantability for patients with severe ACLF could be determined based on SALT-M.","2025","Alimentary pharmacology & therapeutics"

We explored the biochemical and clinical profiles of genetically tested patients to determine the usefulness of these recommendations. This was a retrospective review of patients who underwent analysis of the calcium-sensing receptor gene. In total, 401 patients were identified between 2005 and 2024; 332 (83%) were negative for a mutation, 44 (11%) were positive, and 25 (6%) had variants of unknown significance. Median serum calcium was lower in patients who were negative (negative 10.1 mg/dL, variants of unknown significance 10.6 mg/dL, positive 10.9 mg/dL). Median urine calcium was lower in patients who were positive (negative 110 mg, variants of unknown significance 149 mg, positive 82 mg). Median parathyroid hormone levels were comparable between groups (negative 65 pg/mL, variants of unknown significance 58 pg/mL, positive 60 pg/mL). Eight of 21 (38%) patients who tested positive had urine calcium >100 mg and 5 of 21 (24%) had urine calcium >200 mg. Eight of 35 (23%) patients who were positive had a calcium to creatinine clearance ratio >1%. Urine calcium and calcium to creatinine clearance ratio receiver operating characteristic curves showed poor performance in identifying patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (area under the curve [95% confidence interval]): 0.55 [0.45-0.65] and 0.63 [0.57-0.7], respectively. For positive patients with imaging, sestamibi was inconclusive or nonlocalizing for 13 of 23 and showed multiglandular disease for localizing scans in 7 of 10. Ultrasound was nonlocalizing or equivocal for 11 of 13. In total, 212 of 401 patients (53%) underwent surgery; 100 of 212 were tested preoperatively (0/100 positive, 5/100 variants of unknown significance) and 112 of 212 patients were tested postoperatively (15/112 positive, 10/112 variants of unknown significance). Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia demonstrates non-negligible biochemical overlap with primary hyperparathyroidism, with many patients having a urine calcium value greater than the American Association of Endocrine Surgeons suggested threshold for considering genetic evaluation. More frequent genetic testing beyond urine measurements may help identify more patients with familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia.","2025","Surgery"

Detailed understanding of depression patterns and status of depressive symptoms in adolescents could help identify early intervention targets. Despite the growing use of artificial intelligence for diagnosis and prediction of mental health conditions, the traditional centralized machine learning methods require aggregating adolescents' data; this raises concerns about confidentiality and privacy, which hampers the clinical application of machine learning algorithms. In this study, we use federated learning to solve those problems. We included 583,405 middle and high school adolescents from 20 districts in Chengdu China, and collected from three aspects: individuals, families, and schools, containing 11 psychological phenomena to evaluate the status of depressive symptoms. We compared federated and local training frameworks; the results showed the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve for depression increased by up to 20 % (from 0.7544 with local training to 0.9064 with federated training). Moreover, based on the best-performing model, the XGBoost model, we explore the data heterogeneity in federated learning and found that stress, student burnout, and social connection were the three most important predictors of depression symptoms. We then assessed the impact of each subdimension of depression symptoms, results show that sleep was the most impact one which may provide clues to predict depression symptoms in early stage and improve control and prevention efforts.","2025","Journal of affective disorders"

However, there are obvious subjective factors in the current assessment of anxiety disorders, which may lead to certain diagnostic errors. The identification and diagnosis of anxiety disorders can be further improved if objective biological indicators are added in the assessment process. The current research validates facial expression recognition as a screening tool to assist in detecting generalized anxiety disorder. Based on the International Affective Picture System, we constructed an aided diagnostic experimental paradigm and recorded their facial expression. The split-half reliability was displayed by the Pearson correlation heatmap. The paradigm, GAD-7 and HAMA scales were administered to 60 generalized anxiety disorder patients and 60 matched healthy controls to evaluate the criterion-related validity. Additionally, we conducted a diagnostic study by using MINI as a gold standard and calculated ROC analysis to examine the screening performance of the facial expressions. The heatmap showed very high correlations (r > 0.60, PS < 0.05) along the diagonal of the square heatmap (from the bottom left corner to the top right). The Pearson correlation coefficients between the GAD-7, HAMA and seven facial expressions ranged from -0.35(neutral, P < 0.01) to 0.34(angry, P < 0.01).

We aimed to create and validate a postnatal measurement of mediastinal positioning using chest radiographs in neonates with CDH who require extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Chart review identified neonates with CDH who required veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation between 2017 and 2022. Mediastinal shift index (MSI) is the ratio of the distance between the venous cannula tip and the contralateral chest wall divided by the total width of the contralateral hemithorax. Three raters completed MSI measurements at designated timepoints: after cannulation, post- CDH repair, and immediately before decannulation. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) assessed inter-rater agreement. Initial MSI and observed/expected lung head ratio (O/E LHR) were correlated and compared between survivors and non-survivors. Receiver operative characteristic (ROC) curve analysis evaluated the ability of MSI and O/E LHR to predict survival. 38 neonates were included. MSI demonstrated excellent agreement (ICC>0.98) amongst raters. Initial MSI and O/E LHR had a moderate positive correlation (Spearman correlation = 0.47, p = 0.014). Initial MSI differed significantly between survivors and non-survivors (0.52 vs. 0.33, p = 0.035) as did O/E LHR (0.36 vs. 0.26, p = 0.036). ROC analysis revealed initial MSI >0.35 was predictive of survival with 73% sensitivity and 70% specificity.

Baseline clinical, echocardiographic (left ventricular ejection fraction -LVEF-) and ECG data (summatory of ST-segment elevation -sum-STE- and Q-wave and residual ST-elevation >1 mm -Q-STE-) during admission were registered. Multivariate binary logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic curves were computed for LVTh prediction. LVTh was detected by CMR in 43 (7.3 %) patients and was predicted by previous chronic coronary syndrome (CCS, HR 4.74 [1.82-12.35], p = 0.001), anterior STEMI (HR 10.93 [2.47-48.31], p = 0.002), LVEF (HR 0.96 [0.93-0.99] per %, p = 0.008), maximum sum-STE (HR 1.04 [1.01-1.07] per mm, p = 0.04), and Q-STE (HR 1.31 [1.08-1.6] per lead, p = 0.008). High-risk patients with both major (anterior STEMI and Q-STE in ≥1 leads) and 1-3 minor (CCS, maximum sum-STE >10 mm, LVEF <50%) factors showed the highest LVTh risk (19.6 % within 6 months). The model showed excellent discrimination ability (area under the curve=0.85 [0.81-0.9], p < 0.001). Simplified 4-variable (excluding sum-STE) and 3-variable (also excluding CCS) risk scores showed similar discrimination ability and were externally validated. LVTh within 6 months post-STEMI can be predicted using pre-discharge clinical (anterior infarction and CCS), echocardiographic (LVEF), and ECG (sum-STE and Q-STE) data. Our results can help select patients who should undergo CMR after STEMI for LVTh detection.","2025","European journal of internal medicine"

Then radiomic features were extracted from these identified areas and random forest models were trained to recognize the areas that were most frequently linked to diagnostic errors within each cohort. The performance of the model and discriminatory power of significant radiomic features were assessed. We found that in the Chinese cohort, the AUC values for predicting false positives were 0.864 (CC) and 0.829 (MLO), while in the Australian cohort, they were 0.652 (CC) and 0.747 (MLO). For false negatives, the AUC values in the Chinese cohort were 0.677 (CC) and 0.673 (MLO), and in the Australian cohort, they were 0.600 (CC) and 0.505 (MLO). In both cohorts, regions with higher Gabor and maximum response filter outputs were more prone to false positives, while areas with significant intensity changes and coarse textures were more likely to yield false negatives. This cohort-based pipeline proves effective in identifying common errors for specific reader cohorts based on image-derived radiomic features. This study demonstrates that radiomics-based AI can effectively identify and predict radiologists' interpretation errors in dense mammograms, with distinct radiomic features linked to false positives and false negatives in Chinese and Australian cohorts.","2025","The British journal of radiology"

ROC analysis showed that the area under the curve was 0.930 (95% CI 0.884 to 0.976) and 0.889 (95% CI 0.808 to 0.970) in the training and validation cohorts, respectively. The Hosmer-Lemeshow test yielded a mean absolute error of 0.025 and 0.038, respectively, for the two cohorts. The DCA showed that the nomogram model had superior practicality and accuracy across the majority of the threshold probabilities. The proposed nomogram showed a favourable predictive performance for ENDi in patients with mild large and medium vessel occlusion stroke intended for medical management. For such patients, immediate thrombectomy or at least intensive medical monitoring may be reasonable to avoid delays in rescue thrombectomy.","2025","Journal of neurointerventional surgery"

A prospective study was conducted between October 2022 and April 2024, including 275 consecutive subjects (50 volunteers as controls, 108 patients with T2DM and normal carotid intima-media thickness (CIMT), and 117 patients with T2DM and thickened CIMT). Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) was measured using real-time intima-media thickness (RIMT) technology, while R-QVS was employed to measure the systolic diameter (Diam), displacement (Dist), hardness coefficient (HC), and pulse wave velocity (PWV) of the distal segment of the carotid artery. VFI was used to measure the maximum wall shear stress (WSSmax), mean wall shear stress (WSSmean), and maximum instantaneous velocity (Vmax) of the vessel wall. Differences in ultrasound parameters among the three groups were compared, and receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted to calculate the area under the curve (AUC), evaluating the efficacy of these parameters in assessing structural and functional changes in the carotid arteries of patients with T2DM. There were statistically significant differences in carotid IMT, Diam, Dist, HC, PWV, WSSmax, and Vmax among the three groups (all p < 0.01). The AUCs for evaluating structural and functional changes in the carotid arteries of patients with T2DM using carotid ultrasound parameters Diam, Dist, HC, PWV, WSSmax, and Vmax were 0.64, 0.68, 0.83, 0.88, 0.86, and 0.82, respectively. Multiple linear regression analysis identified Dist., HC, PWV, WSSmax, and WSSmean as influencing factors for CIMT in T2DM patients (with β values of -0.406, 0.515, 0.564, -0.472, and -0.438, respectively; all p < 0.05). R-QVS and VFI techniques contribute to the early assessment of structural and functional changes in the carotid arteries of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. Compared with controls, T2DM patients exhibit more advanced functional changes than morphological changes despite normal CIMT. The enhanced sensitivity, reproducibility, and detailed assessment capabilities of these methods make them valuable tools in the early detection and intervention of cardiovascular risk in T2DM.","2025","Ultrasound in medicine & biology"

A retrospective study was conducted wherein SA patients undergoing surgical resection with a minimum follow up of 12 months were included in this study. Modified Mccormick Scale (MMS) was utilized to record the neurological status of the patients both preoperatively and at last follow up. Outcomes were assessed as: long term neurological status, that is final MMS grade and neurological deterioration, defined as increase in MMS score as compared to preoperative MMS score. Survival analysis was performed using the kaplan meier curves. 71 patients were included in this study with mean age of 33.07years. At a mean follow up of 57 months, preoperative MMS was the single independent predictor for moderate-severe neurological deficit (MMS III to V) on multivariate analysis (OR: 30.2, p < 0.001) and had an outstanding AUC of 0.91. Six patients had neurological deterioration at long term follow up. Absence of spasticity (p = 0.028), thoracic-thoracolumbar tumors (p = 0.006), low MMS score (p = 0.01) and hypointense T1 weighted MRI (p = 0.009) were significant predictors of long term neurological deterioration. The median overall survival was 48 months and was significantly higher in low grade tumors (p < 0.001). The study highlights the efficacy of clinical features as a predictor of long term functional outcomes in SA patients. Role of spasticity as a prognostic factor was explored for the first time in this study.","2025","Journal of neuro-oncology"

However, its poor stability and low bioavailability in the upper digestive tract hinder its application in the functional food industry. To address these challenges, this study employed porous starch (PS) as a carrier to develop PS microspheres loaded with luteolin (PSLUT), simulating its release in vitro. The research assessed the hypoglycemic effects of LUT in type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) mice both before and after PS treatment. In vitro findings demonstrated that PS improved LUT's stability in simulated gastric fluids and enhanced its in vivo bioavailability, aligning with experimental outcomes. PSLUT administration significantly improved body weight, fasting blood glucose (FBG), oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), pancreatic islet function, and other relevant indicators in T2DM mice. Moreover, PSLUT alleviated abnormal liver biochemical indicators and liver tissue injury caused by T2DM. The underlying hypoglycemic mechanism of PSLUT is thought to involve the regulation of protein kinase B (AKT-1) and glucose transporter 2 (GLUT-2). After four weeks of intervention, various PSLUT doses significantly reduced the Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes ratio at the phylum level and decreased the relative abundance of harmful bacteria at the genus level, including Acetatifactor, Candidatus-Arthromitus, and Turicibacter. This microbial shift was associated with improvements in hyperglycemia-related indicators such as FBG, the area under the curve (AUC) of OGTT, and homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), which are closely linked to these bacterial genera. Additionally, Lachnoclostridium, Parasutterella, Turicibacter, and Papillibacter were identified as key intestinal marker genera involved in T2DM progression through Spearman correlation analysis. In conclusion, PS enhanced LUT's hypoglycemic efficacy by modulating the transcription and protein expression levels of AKT-1 and GLUT-2, as well as the relative abundance of potential gut pathogens in T2DM mice. These results provide a theoretical foundation for advancing luteolin's application in the functional food industry and further investigating its hypoglycemic potential.","2025","Food & function"

This study aimed to examine the ability of MB PSA versus PSA doubling time (PSADT) and PSA velocity (PSAV) in assessing the likelihood of developing of lethal prostate cancer (PCa) in a diverse and contemporary North American population. Men 40-59 years old, who received their first PSA between the years 1995 and 2019, were included. For MB PSA values, the first PSA test result was included. For PSADT, the first two PSA test results were included. For PSAV, the first three PSA test results within 30 months were included. Selection criteria resulted in a total of 77,594 patients with at least two PSA test results and 11,634 patients with at least three PSA test results. Multivariable Fine-Gray regression was used to examine the impact of the value of the PSA testing methods on the development of lethal PCa (defined as death from PCa or development of metastatic disease either at diagnosis or during follow-up). Time-dependent receiver operating characteristic/area under the curve (AUC) at 5, 10, and 15 years were plotted. In the main cohort, patients were most frequently in the 50-54 age category (32.8%), had a Charlson comorbidity index of 0 (70.5%), and were White (63.2%). Of these, 9.3% had the midlife baseline PSA in the top 10th percentile, and 0.4% had a PSADT 0-6 months. Lethal PCa was diagnosed in 593 (0.8%) patients. The median (interquartile range) time to lethal PCa was 8.6 (3.2-14.9) years. In the main cohort, MB PSA and PSADT showed significant associations with the occurrence of lethal PCa, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 6.10 (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.85-7.68) and HR of 2.20 (95% CI, 1.07-4.54) for patients in the top 10th percentile MB PSA group and in the PSADT between 0 to <6 months group, respectively. In patients with three PSA results available, MB PSA and PSAV showed significant associations with the occurrence of lethal PCa, with a HR of 3.95 (95% CI, 2.29-6.79) and 3.57 (95% CI, 2.17-5.86) for patients in the top 10th percentile MB PSA group and in the in the PSAV >0.4 ng/mL/year group, respectively. PSADT and PSAV did not exhibit higher AUCs than MB PSA in assessing the likelihood of lethal PCa. Specifically, they were 0.818 and 0.708 at 10 and 15 years, respectively, for the PSADT; 0.862 and 0.756 at 10 and 15 years, respectively, for the PSAV; and 0.868 and 0.762 at 10 and 15 years, respectively, for the MB PSA (all p > .05). The study findings are that PSAV or PSADT were not superior to midlife baseline in assessing the likelihood of developing lethal PCa. This suggests that these variables may not have practical use in enhancing PSA screening strategies in a clinical setting.","2025","Cancer"

Conventional scores are time-consuming and therefore difficult to use in an emergency setting. For early decision-making, an easy-to-use score based on the medications administered by the EMS may have prognostic value. The primary objective of this study was to develop the prehospital drug-derived score (PDDS) for 2-day mortality. A prospective, multicenter, ambulance-based cohort study was conducted in adults with undifferentiated acute diseases treated by EMS and transferred to the emergency department. Demographic data, prehospital diagnosis data, prehospital medication and variables for the calculation of the National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2), Rapid Emergency Medicine Score (REMS), and Rapid Acute Physiology Score (RAPS) were collected. The PDDS was developed and validated, establishing three levels of risk of 2-day mortality. The predictive capability of each score was determined by the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) and compared using the Delong's test (p-value). A total of 6401 patients were included. The PDDS included age and the use of norepinephrine, analgesics, neuromuscular blocking agents, diuretics, antihypertensive agents, tranexamic acid, and bicarbonate. The AUROC of PDDS was .86 (95% CI: .816-.903) versus NEWS2 .866 (95% CI: .822-.911), p = .828; versus REMS .885 (95% CI: .845-.924), p = .311; versus RAPS .886 (95% CI: .846-.926), p = .335, respectively. The newly developed easy-to-use prehospital drug-derived PDDS score has an excellent predictive value of early mortality. The PDDS score was comparable to the conventional risk scores and therefore might serve as an alternative score in the prehospital emergency setting.","2025","European journal of clinical investigation"

Here, serum RvD2 levels were detected with an attempt to explore its prognostic implication in human acute intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH). In this prospective cohort study, serum RvD2 levels of 301 ICH patients, coupled with 100 heathy individuals, were gauged. All patients were randomly divided to two groups (200 patients in the study group and 101 in the validation group) in a 2:1 ratio. Change of serum RvD2 levels after ICH was investigated, and its correlations with National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS) scores, hematoma volume and poststroke six-month modified Rankin Scale (mRS) scores were determined using multivariate analysis. Its independent association with poor prognosis (mRS scores of 3-6) was uncovered in the study group and its prognostic predictive value was verified in the validation group. The serum levels of RvD2 in patients displayed a notable decline upon admission, as compared to controls. The levels exhibited independent correlations with NIHSS scores, hematoma size and mRS scores. Alternatively, RvD2 levels had independent relation to a poor prognosis after ICH. Within the framework of restricted cubic spline analysis, RvD2 levels were linearly correlated with the likelihood of poor prognosis, even adjusting for NIHSS scores and hematoma size. In the context of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis, serum RvD2 dramatically distinguished risk of poor prognosis, with similar predictive ability to NIHSS scores and hematoma volume. By employing subgroup analysis, the relationship between RvD2 levels and poor prognosis was not obviously influenced by other parameters, such as age, sex, hypertension, and more. The integrated model containing serum RvD2, NIHSS scores and hematoma volume was visualized on a nomogram and showed high predictive performance and clinical effectiveness for poor prognosis via multiple evaluation metrics, including the Hosmer-Lemeshow test, ROC curve analysis, calibration curve analysis and decision curve analysis. Clinical usefulness of serum RvD2 was verified in the validation group. Serum RvD2 levels exhibit an immediate decrease post-ICH, which could be able to accurately reflect ICH severity and efficiently prognosticate poor neurological outcomes, signifying that serum RvD2 may represent an encouraging prognostic indicator in ICH.","2025","Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry"

In a retrospective cohort of 10,227 patients undergoing regadenoson stress single-photon emission computed tomography myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI), HRR, and SBPR were calculated as 100×(peak hyperemia value-baseline value)/baseline value. During 35±21 months follow-up, 921 (8.8%) deaths were observed. The median HRR was 35% (interquartile range [IQR], 21% to 51%). The median SBPR was -9% (IQR, -17% to -2%). HRR and SBPR were independently associated with all-cause mortality with adjusted hazard ratio [HR] of .980 per 1% increment in HRR (CI, .977-.984) and .994 per 1% increment in SBPR (CI, .988-.999). Mortality rates increased with decreasing HRR quartile and SBPR tertile. HRR provided incremental prognostic value for all-cause mortality beyond clinical and imaging parameters (area under the curve [AUC] increase, .03; P<.001) and SBPR data (AUC increase, .11; P<0001). SBPR did not provide significant incremental prognostic value beyond clinical and imaging parameters or HRR data. We derived and validated HRR of <20% as a cut-off that can improve risk stratification beyond clinical and MPI findings. Among patients undergoing stress MPI, impaired HRR to regadenoson provided independent and incremental prognostic value for all-cause mortality beyond clinical, imaging, and SBPR data. SBPR positively correlates with HRR, but it does not provide incremental prognostic utility. HRR, but not SBPR, should be routinely reported and considered in assessing patients' overall risk. An abnormal HRR threshold of <20% can improve risk stratification.","2025","Journal of nuclear cardiology : official publication of the American Society of Nuclear Cardiology"

In this study, we: 1) evaluated SLC6A4/TPH2 methylation biomarker potential for predicting clinical outcomes after escitalopram treatment; 2) evaluated whether changes in SLC6A4/TPH2 methylation are informative of treatment mechanisms. We used a cohort of 90 unmedicated patients with major depressive disorder that were part of a 12-week open-label longitudinal trial and compared our observations with previous findings. Depressive symptoms were measured at baseline and after 8 and 12 weeks of treatment using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD6/17). We found an association between baseline TPH2 methylation and both clinical response (β:3.43; p = 0.01; 95 % CI:[0.80; 6.06]) and change in depressive symptoms after 8 weeks (β:-45.44; p = 0.01; 95 %CI:[- -78.58; -12.30]).

Methylation levels changed at the trend level for CpG sites of SLC6A4 and TPH2 over the course of 12 weeks of treatment. In addition, similar to previous observations, we found a trend for an association between methylation of SLC6A4 CpG2 (chr17:30,236,083) and HAMD17 change after 12 weeks.

The supramolecular assemblies formed at a 1:1 molar ratio of AP[5] to MV exhibited remarkable colloidal stability, a negative surface charge, and a high association constant.An acetal-functionalized pillara[5]arenes (AP[5]) crystalsomes were fabricated to reduce the toxicity of pemetrexed (PMX) in off-target sites and deliver the therapeutic doses to the active sites. Extensive characterization of the crystalsomes was performed, revealing their morphology and crystalline structure through SEM and TEM imaging. WAXS analysis confirmed the crystalline nature of the assemblies, and SAED patterns indicated that the crystalsome shell consisted of lamellae resembling single crystals with polymer chains oriented parallel to the interface. To enhnace the targeting capabilities, the surface of the crystalsomes was modified with biotin by conjugating viologen with biotin (MV-BT), aiming to target biotin receptors overexpressed on tumor cells. These biotin -modified crystalsomes (PMX-BT@CLs) were designed to be acid-labile facilitating the release of encapsulated drugs upon cellular internalization, as confirmed by confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). In vivo, studies demonstrated that the PMX-loaded crystalsomes remained in circulation for extended period, showing improved pharmacokinetics. The area under the curve (AUC) of PMX-BT@CLs was approxiately 3.9 times higher than that of the free drug. Additionally, the relative tumor volume was found to be about 3.5 times lower in the group treated with biotin-modified crystalsomes compared to those treated with free PMX. The mean survival time was also significantly enhanced in the PMX-BT@CLs group.

Therefore, This study aims to investigate the association between CCs and plaque vulnerability in culprit lesions of AMI patients, identify the factors influencing CCs formation, and develop a predictive model for CCs. A total of 431 culprit lesions from AMI patients who underwent pre-intervention optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging were analyzed. Patients were divided into groups based on the presence or absence of CCs and PR. The relationship between CCs and plaque vulnerability was evaluated. A risk nomogram for predicting CCs was developed using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator and logistic regression analysis. CCs were identified in 64.5 % of patients with AMI. The presence of CCs was associated with a higher prevalence of vulnerable plaque features, such as thin-cap fibroatheroma (TCFA), PR, macrophage infiltration, neovascularization, calcification, and thrombus, compared to patients without CCs. The CCs model demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.676 for predicting PR. Incorporating CCs into the TCFA model (AUC = 0.656) significantly enhanced predictive accuracy, with a net reclassification improvement index of 0.462 (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 0.263-0.661, p < 0.001) and an integrated discrimination improvement index of 0.031 (95 % CI: 0.013-0.048, p = 0.001).

It is unknown how cage subsidence following anterior cervical corpectomy decompression and fusion is related to MRI-based endplate bone quality assessment. To create a similar MRI-based cervical spine scoring system (C-EBQ) and to investigate the predictive value of the MRI cervical endplate bone quality (C-EBQ) score for cage subsidence after ACCF. The patients' demographic, surgical, and radiological data were collected. Cage subsidence was defined as fusion segment height loss ≥ 3 mm. Multivariate logistic regression models were developed to determine correlations between potential risk factors and subsidence, and simple linear regression analyses of statistically significant indicators were performed. Among the patients who underwent single-level ACCF, 72 met the requirements for inclusion. The C-VBQ scores also improved from 2.28 ± 0.12, indicating no subsidence, to 3.27 ± 0.35, which indicated subsidence, and the C-EBQ scores improved in both the nonsubsidence group (1.95 ± 0.80) and the subsidence group (2.38 ± 0.54). There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) among the groups. Higher C-EBQ scores were strongly correlated with subsidence in the multivariate analysis (odds ratio [OR] = 17.249, 95% CI = 2.269 to 7.537, P < 0.001), and the C-VBQ score was the major independent predictor of subsidence following ACCF ([OR] = 4.752, 95% CI = 3.824 to 8.781, P < 0.05). The C-EBQ score outperformed the C-VBQ score (75.6%) in terms of predictive accuracy, with a ROC curve indicating an 89.4% score. After ACCF, cage subsidence was strongly correlated with higher C-EBQ scores on preoperative MRI. Assessing C-EBQ before ACCF may be a useful way to estimate the likelihood of postoperative subsidence.","2025","European spine journal : official publication of the European Spine Society, the European Spinal Deformity Society, and the European Section of the Cervical Spine Research Society"

We aimed to assess the cardio-hepatic axis post-STEMI using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR). This prospective, observational, single-centre study included consecutive patients with STEMI who underwent CMR after primary angioplasty from January 2015 to January 2019. Standard infarct characteristics were analysed, and hepatic T1 and hepatic extracellular volume (ECV) were assessed using pre- and post-contrast T1 mapping sequences. The primary endpoint was the relationship between native hepatic T1 values and ischaemic right ventricular (RV) involvement, determined by RV ejection fraction (EF) dysfunction and/or the presence of RV acute myocardial infarction (AMI). The diagnostic performance of hepatic T1 values for detecting RV involvement was assessed using the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). Of 177 consecutive patients with STEMI undergoing CMR, 142 were included. Patients with RV ischaemic involvement, compared with those without, had significantly higher native hepatic T1 (P < 0.001) and hepatic ECV (P = 0.016). Hepatic T1 values demonstrated a good diagnostic performance in detecting RV involvement (AUC 0.826, P < 0.001) and correlated positively with NT-proBNP values (r = 0.754, P < 0.001). Patients with high hepatic T1 values (> 605 ms) had significantly higher NT-proBNP levels (< 0.001), larger RV end-diastolic volume (P < 0.001), lower RVEF (P < 0.001), and a higher prevalence of RV AMI (P = 0.022) compared with those with hepatic T1 ≤ 605 ms, whereas left ventricular EF and infarct size were similar. Multivariable logistic regression analysis identified RVEF (P = 0.010) and NT-proBNP values (P < 0.001) as independent predictors of increased hepatic T1 values. Patients with increased hepatic T1 values had a higher rate of rehospitalization for heart failure at 17-month follow-up (12.1 vs. 2.0%, P = 0.046). Hepatic T1 mapping has emerged as a possible novel imaging biomarker of the cardio-hepatic axis in STEMI, being associated with RV involvement and increased NT-proBNP values.","2025","European heart journal.

The aim of this study was to identify key predictors and patient trajectories predisposing to ACLF. In this multicenter, prospective study spanning 2 years, clinical, biochemical, and 90-day survival data were collected from 625 patients with AD (European Association for the Study of the Liver criteria) across North, South, and East India. We divided the cohort into a Derivation cohort (DC: 318 patients) and a Validation cohort (VC: 307 patients). Predictive models for pre-ACLF were derived, validated, and compared with established scores such as model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) 3.0 and chronic liver failure Consortium acute decompensation. Of 625 patients (mean age 49 years, 83% male, 77.5% with alcohol-related liver disease), 32.2% progressed to ACLF. Patients progressing to ACLF showed significantly higher bilirubin (10.9 vs 8.1 mg/dL), leukocyte counts (9,400 vs 8,000 per mm 3 ), international normalized ratio (1.9 vs 1.8), and MELD 3.0 (28 vs 25) but lower sodium (131 vs 134 mEq/L) and survival (62% vs 86%) compared with those without progression ( P < 0.05) in the DC. Consistent results were noted with alcohol-associated hepatitis, infection and hepatic encephalopathy as additional risk factors in VC. Liver failure at presentation (odds ratio: 2.4 [in DC], 6.9 [in VC]) and the 7-day trajectories of bilirubin, international normalized ratio, and MELD 3.0 significantly predicted ACLF progression ( P < 0.001). A new pre-ACLF model showed superior predictive capability (area under the curve of 0.71 in DC and 0.82 in VC) compared with MELD 3.0 and chronic liver failure Consortium acute decompensation scores ( P < 0.05). Approximately one-third of AD patients in this Indian cohort rapidly progressed to ACLF, resulting in high mortality.

Herein, we design an enzyme-accelerated catalytic hairpin assembly (EACHA) in which duplex DNA products are converted into hairpin reactants to continue participating in the next circuit reaction with the assistance of RNase H. Profiting from the high recyclability of the reactants, EACHA exhibits an approximately 37.6-fold enhancement in the rate constant and a two-order-of-magnitude improvement in sensitivity compared to conventional catalytic hairpin assembly (CHA). By integrating an allosteric probe with EACHA, a one-pot method is developed for rapid and direct detection of S. enterica Enteritidis (S. Enteritidis). This method is capable of detecting 15 CFU mL-1 of S. Enteritidis within 20 min, which is superior to that of real-time PCR. By testing 60 milk samples, we demonstrate this method's high accuracy in discriminating contaminated samples, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.997. Moreover, this method can be employed to accurately diagnose early-stage infected mice, with an AUC of 1.00 for feces samples and 0.986 for serum samples. Therefore, this study offers a simple and feasible method for identifying pathogens in complex matrices.","2025","Biosensors & bioelectronics"

Patients with incidental or indeterminate findings have historically been managed with observation or operatively. Fluoroscopic identification of the duodenojejunal junction (DJJ) and ileocecal junction (ICJ) can guide operative decision-making, but algorithms have not been validated. This study aimed to determine whether fluoroscopic mesenteric base width (MBW) standardized to abdominal wall diameter (AWD) correlates with intraoperative anatomy in infants. We retrospectively reviewed patients between 2013 and 2023 who were <1 year with fluoroscopy identifying DJJ and ICJ. Infants with normal rotation evaluated for digestive concerns were included. Congenital conditions with intestinal nonrotation were excluded. Two radiologists independently measured MBW as a diagonal line from DJJ to ICJ and maximal transverse AWD from inferior ribs. A ratio was calculated and compared between groups. Wilcoxon rank-sum and Kruskal-Wallis tests with p < 0.05 were considered significant. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) was used to identify optimal ratio cutoff. Fifty-eight patients, 22 normally rotated and 36 with intestinal rotational abnormality (IRA), met inclusion criteria. Preoperative radiographic concern for malrotation differed between groups (p < 0.0001). Median MBW:AWD was significantly lower in IRA than normal rotation based on imaging (0.31 vs 0.65, p < 0.0001). Optimal MBW:AWD of 0.55 had an AUROC of 0.9578. Radiographic measurement of MBW:AWD accurately predicted IRA from normal rotation with an optimal ratio cutoff of 0.55.

This study aimed to identify clinicopathological factors of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome and develop the first Japanese-specific prediction model for BRCA pathogenic variant carriers in Japan. We utilized data from 3072 Japanese patients with breast cancer aggregated by the Japanese Organization of Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer registry. Prediction models were developed using 70% of the overall dataset and validated using the remaining 30%. Factors associated with the BRCA pathogenic variant status were identified using logistic univariate analysis, and significant factors were further analyzed using logistic multivariate analysis to develop prediction models for BRCA1/2 (BRCA1 and/or BRCA2), BRCA1, and BRCA2 pathogenic variants. BRCA1 showed associations with aggressive clinicopathological factors such as triple-negative breast cancer and nuclear grade 3. Moreover, the prediction model showed a high area under the curve (AUC) of 0.879. By contrast, BRCA2 exhibited fewer characteristic associated factors, and the AUC of the model was 0.669. Common factors shared by BRCA1/2, BRCA1, and BRCA2 were the age at diagnosis of breast cancer and the youngest age of relatives with breast cancer. Consistent with previous research, early-onset breast cancer appeared to be strongly associated with HBOC. We successfully developed prediction models for BRCA1/2, BRCA1, and BRCA2 pathogenic variants. By accurately stratifying patients' risk and guiding targeted screening and preventative interventions, these models will contribute to improved management and outcomes of HBOC.","2025","Breast cancer research and treatment"

However, previous models have not been properly validated with an external data set or have reported poor predictive performances. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to design a machine learning model for knee osteoarthritis progression, focusing on high validation quality and clinical applicability. A retrospective analysis was conducted on prospectively collected data, using the Osteoarthritis Initiative data set (5966 knees) for model development and the Multicenter Osteoarthritis Study data set (3392 knees) for validation. The analysis aimed to predict Kellgren-Lawrence grade (KLG) progression over 4-5 years in knees with initial KLG of 0, 1, or 2. Possible predictors included demographics, comorbidities, history of meniscectomy, gait speed, Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) scores, and radiological findings. The Random Forest algorithm was employed for the predictive model development. Baseline KLG, contralateral knee osteoarthritis, lateral joint space narrowing (JSN) grade, BMI, medial JSN grade, and total WOMAC score were six features selected for the model in descending order of importance. Odds ratios of baseline KLG, contralateral knee osteoarthritis, and lateral JSN grade were 1.76, 2.59, and 4.74, respectively (all p < 0.001). The area-under-the-curve of the ROC curve in the validation set was 0.76 with an accuracy of 0.68 and an F1-score of 0.56.

We used data collected in the course of clinical care to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of patient hospitalization or death within the next 7 days. The data included vital signs, diagnoses, laboratory results, food intake, and clinical notes. We also asked SNF nurses and hospital case managers to make their own predictions as a comparison. The EHR was used as the source of information on whether the patient died or was hospitalized. The model had sensitivity of 35%, specificity of 92%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 18%, and area under the receiver operator curve (AUC) of 0.75. A variation of the model in which we did not include progress notes and food intake achieved an AUC of 0.70. Nurse raters achieved a sensitivity of 61%, specificity of 73%, and PPV of 10%.

We conducted an observational test characteristics study using a dataset of 3,645 cows approaching dry-off from 68 US dairy herds. The outcome variables of interest were cow-level IMI caused by all pathogens, major pathogens, and Streptococcus and Streptococcus-like organisms (SSLO), which were determined using aerobic culture of aseptic quarter-milk samples and identification of isolates using MALDI-TOF. Individual cow records were extracted from the farm software to create 53 feature variables at the cow and 39 at the herd level, which were derived from cow-level descriptive data, records of clinical mastitis events, results from routine testing of milk for volume, and concentrations of SCC, fat, and protein. Machine learning (ML) algorithms evaluated were logistic regression, decision tree, random forest, light gradient-boosting machine, naive Bayes, and neural networks. For comparison, cows were also classified according to a conventional rule-based algorithm that considered a cow as high risk for IMI if she had one or more high SCC (>200,000 cells/mL) tests or ≥2 cases of clinical mastitis during the lactation of enrollment. Area under the curve (AUC) and Youden's index were used to compare models, in addition to binary classification metrics, including sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values. The ML models had slightly higher AUC and Youden's index values than the rule-based algorithm for all IMI outcomes of interest. However, these improvements in prediction accuracy were substantially less than what we had considered necessary for the technology to be a worthwhile alternative to the rule-based algorithm. Therefore, evidence is lacking to support the wholesale use of ML-guided selective dry cow therapy at the moment. We recommend that producers wanting to implement algorithm-guided selective dry cow therapy use a rule-based method.","2025","Journal of dairy science"

This study included 528 patients with lung adenocarcinoma who were randomly divided into training and validation cohorts at a 7:3 ratio. The pretrained vision transformer (ViT) was utilized to extract deep transfer learning (DTL) feature, and logistic regression was employed to construct a ViT-based DTL model. Subsequently, the model was compared with six classical convolutional neural network (CNN) models. Finally, the ViT-based DTL signature was combined with independent clinical predictors to construct a ViT-based deep transfer learning nomogram (DTLN). The ViT-based DTL model showed good performance, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.821 (95% CI, 0.775-0.867) in the training cohort and 0.825 (95% CI, 0.758-0.891) in the validation cohort. The ViT-based DTL model demonstrated comparable performance to classical CNN models in predicting LNM, and the ViT-based DTL signature was then used to construct ViT-based DTLN with independent clinical predictors such as tumor maximum diameter, location, and density.

We previously developed a cell-based assay using Hoxb8 mast cells (Hoxb8 MCs) aimed at improving clinical allergy diagnosis. In this study, we assessed its diagnostic performance by measuring blinded sera from a prospectively enrolled and pre-validated peanut allergy cohort. Hoxb8 MCs were passively sensitized with sera from peanut-allergic and peanut tolerant children and adolescents (n = 112). Degranulation of Hoxb8 MCs was quantified upon stimulation with dose-titrated peanut extract by means of flow cytometry, using CD107a as activation marker. The results from the Hoxb8 mast cell activation test (Hoxb8 MAT) were compared to established diagnostic assays such as the skin prick test (SPT), specific IgE (sIgE) levels, and the basophil activation test (BAT). Additionally, serum samples from BAT nonresponders were assessed with the Hoxb8 MAT. Hoxb8 MAT displayed a robust dose-dependent activation to peanut extract, with a cutoff value of ≤5.2% CD107a positive cells. The diagnostic accuracy was highest at allergen concentrations ≥100 ng/mL, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.97, 93% sensitivity, and 96% specificity, outperforming traditional SPT and sIgE tests. When compared to BAT, Hoxb8 MAT exhibited comparable diagnostic efficacy. Moreover, sera from BAT nonresponders were accurately classified into allergics and nonallergics by the Hoxb8 MAT. The Hoxb8 MAT demonstrated a very good diagnostic precision in patients prospectively assessed for peanut allergy comparable to the fresh whole blood-based BAT. Additionally, it demonstrated its value for accurate classification of BAT nonresponders into allergic and nonallergic individuals.

To explore biomarkers associated with necroptosis in IDD, reveal the pathogenesis of IDD, as well as provide new directions for the diagnosis and treatment of this disease. Retrospective cohort study. Our study employs scRNA-seq coupled with MR analysis to investigate the causal relationship between necroptosis and IDD, laying a foundational groundwork for unveiling the intricate pathogenic mechanisms of this condition. Data quality control and normalisation was executed in single-cell dataset, GSE205535. Then, different cell types were obtained by cell annotation through marker genes. Subsequently, chi-square test was employed to assess the distribution difference of different cell types between IDD and control to screen key cells. AUCell was applied to calculate necroptosis-related genes (NRGs) scores of all cell types, further key cells were divided into high and low NRGs groups according to the median AUC scores of different cell types. Afterwards, the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) within the 2 score groups were screened. Then, the genes that had causal relationship with IDD were selected as biomarkers by univariate and multivariate Mendelian randomization (MR) analysis. Finally, the expression of biomarkers in different cell types and pseudo-time analysis was analyzed separately. In GSE205535, 16 different cell populations identified by UMAP cluster analysis were further annotated to 8 cell types using maker genes. Afterwards, 53 DEGs were screened between the high and low NRGs groups. In addition, 9 genes with causal relationship with IDD were obtained by univariate MR analysis, further multivariate MR analysis proved that NT5E and TMEM158 had a direct causal relationship with IDD, which were used as biomarkers in this study. This study not only found that the expression levels of NT5E and TMEM158 were higher in IDD group, but also found that fibrochondrocytes and inflammatory chondrocytes were the key cells of NT5E and TMEM158, respectively. In the end, the biomarkers had the same expression trend in the quasi-time series, and both of them from high to low and then increased. NT5E and TMEM158, as biomarkers of necroptotic apoptotic IDD, were causally associated with IDD. The understanding of chondrocytes as key cells provides new perspectives for deeper elucidation of the pathogenesis of IDD, improved diagnostic methods, and the development of more effective treatments.

Finally, 100 target genes of the DE miRNAs were predicted and were significantly enriched in the B cell receptor, neurotrophin, ferroptosis, and EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor resistance signaling pathways. The constructed diagnostic model based on six DE miRNA combinations has important clinical value for the early diagnosis of HCC.","2025","Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry"
1523,"39332044","Specific isolation and quantification of PD-L1 positive tumor derived exosomes for accurate breast cancer discrimination via aptamer-functionalized magnetic composites and SERS immunoassay.","PD-L1 positive tumor derived exosomes (TEXsPD-L1) play a significant role in disease progression, tumor metastasis and cancer immunotherapy. However, the overlap of PD-L1 between TEXs and non-tumor derived exosomes (non-TEXs) restricts the specific isolation and quantification of TEXPD-L1 from clinical samples. Herein, a new aptamer-functionalized and hydrophilic immunomagnetic substrate was designed by decorating generation 5 polyamidoamine dendrimers (G5 PAMAM), zwitterionic trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) and EpCAM (Epithelial cell adhesion molecule) aptamers on magnetic cores sequentially (Fe3O4@PAMAM@TMAO@Aptamer, named as FPTA) for rapid target and efficient capture of TEXs. The FPTA substrate gathered excellent characters of strong magnetic responsiveness of Fe3O4, abundant affinity sites of PAMAM, strong hydrophilicity of TMAO and enhanced affinity properties of EpCAM aptamers. Because of these advantages, FPTA can isolate TEXs quickly within 30min with high capture efficiency of 90.5 % ± 3.0 % and low nonspecific absorption of 8.2 % ± 2.0 % for non-TEXs. Furthermore, PD-L1 (Programmed cell death-ligand 1) positive TEXs (TEXsPD-L1) from the captured TEXs were recognized and quantitatively analyzed by utilizing SERS (surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy) reporter molecules 4-NTP (4-Nitrothiophenol) on PD-L1 aptamers-functionalized gold immunoaffinity probe. The signal of TEXsPD-L1 was converted to SERS signal of 4-NTP at 1344 cm-1 which exhibited a linear correlation to concentration of TEXsPD-L1(R2 = 0.9905). With these merits, this strategy was further applied to clinical plasma samples from breast cancer (BC) patients and healthy controls (HC), exhibited an excellent diagnosis accuracy with area under curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve reaching 0.988. All these results demonstrate that the FPTA immunomagnetic substrate combined with SERS immunoaffinity probe may become a generic tool for specific isolation and quantitative analysis of PD-L1 positive tumor-derived exosomes in clinics.","2025","Talanta"

All samples were assessed by liquid-based cytology, HPV genotyping and PAX1/SOX1 methylation. AUC (area under the curve), sensitivity and specificity for cytology, HPV16/18 genotyping and PAX1/SOX1 methylation for high-grade (HG) premalignant cervical lesions. PAX1 was more sensitive than cytology and HPV16/18 genotyping in detecting a HG lesion (CIN2+). The sensitivity for PAX1, SOX1, cytology and HPV16/18 were 73.5% (95% CI: 65.5-81.5), 41.9% (95% CI: 32.9-50.8), 48.7% (95% CI: 39.7-57.8) and 36.8% (95% CI: 28.0-45.5), respectively, and their respective specificities were 70.3% (95% CI: 65.0-75.6), 83.6% (95% CI: 79.3-87.9), 77.6% (95% CI: 72.8-82.5) and 67.1% (95% CI: 61.7-72.6), respectively. Overall, PAX1 gave the best AUC at 0.72. Adding SOX1 to PAX1 did not improve the AUC (0.68). Three hundred and twenty-two women who did not have a HG lesion at baseline were followed up for two rounds of screening. Fewer women developed a HG lesion with a normal baseline PAX1 compared to women with a normal baseline cytology or negative HPV16/18 (8.4% vs. 14.5% and 17.5%, respectively). PAX1 triage for referral to colposcopy in HPV-positive women may be superior to cytology and HPV16/18 genotyping.","2025","BJOG : an international journal of obstetrics and gynaecology"

However, these scores have not been evaluated in pediatric cohorts. We retrospectively report on 76 pediatric and adolescent and young adult (AYA) patients with relapsed/refractory B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia treated with CD19-CAR T cells at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital or Johns Hopkins Hospital. Data included patient, disease, and treatment characteristics. EASIX and m-EASIX scores were calculated at days -5 before, 0, and +3 after CAR T-cell infusion. CRS and ICANS occurred in 47 and 17 patients, respectively. At all evaluated time points, the median EASIX scores were higher for patients who developed severe CRS and any grade ICANS, and the median m-EASIX scores were higher in patients who developed severe CRS and severe ICANS than those with no/mild CRS/ICANS. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that both scores were strong predictors of CRS, especially severe CRS, at all time points. Any grade and severe ICANS were best predicted by both scores at day +3. m-EASIX uniformly outperformed EASIX, except for predicting any grade ICANS. Our results validate the potential utility of EASIX and m-EASIX scores for predicting CAR T-cell-related complications for pediatric and AYA patients.","2025","Blood advances"

We aimed to investigate whether long-term average visual, hearing, and dual sensory impairment was independently associated with cognitive impairment, incident dementia, and incident depressive symptoms. We used data from the Health and Retirement Study (HRS) and the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study (CHARLS), two nationally representative and prospective cohorts of community middle aged and older adults. Average sensory impairment was calculated using the area under the curve divided by follow-up time from wave 3 (1996) to wave 15 (2020) in HRS and wave 1 (2011) to wave 4 (2018) in CHARLS. Cox regression models adjusted for multiple covariates were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HRs) and 95 % confidence intervals (95 % CIs). For each one standard deviation (SD) increment in average visual impairment, the risk of developing cognitive impairment, incident dementia, and incident depressive symptoms increased by 12 %, 34 %, and 39 % in CHARLS and 11 %, 14 % and 10 % in HRS. Similar results were found for each SD increment in average hearing impairment and dual sensory impairment. Nonlinear dose-response relationships were identified between visual impairment and dementia, as well as dual sensory impairment and dementia in both cohorts.

The aim of this study was to compare the predictive values of the revised RAI (RAI-rev), the modified frailty index-5 (mFI-5), and advanced age for extended length of stay, 30-day readmission, complications, and mortality among patients undergoing spine surgery for metastatic spinal tumors. A retrospective cohort study was performed using the 2012-2022 ACS NSQIP database to identify adult patients who underwent spinal surgery for metastatic spinal pathologies. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) and multivariable analyses, we compared the discriminative thresholds and independent associations of RAI-rev, mFI-5, and greater patient age with extended length of stay (LOS), 30-day complications, hospital readmission, and mortality. A total of 1,796 patients were identified, of which 1,116 (62.1%) were male and 1,008 (70.7%) were non-Hispanic White. RAI-rev identified 1,291 (71.9%) frail and 208 (11.6%) very frail patients, while mFI-5 identified 272 (15.1%) frail and 49 (2.7%) very frail patients. In the ROC analysis for extended LOS, both RAI-rev and mFI-5 showed modest predictive capabilities with area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.5477 and 0.5329, respectively, and no significant difference in their predictive abilities (p = 0.446). When compared to age, RAI-rev demonstrated superior prediction (p = 0.015). With respect to predicting 30-day readmission, no significant difference was observed between RAI-rev and mFI-5 (AUC 0.5394 l respectively, p = 0.354). However, RAI-rev outperformed age (p = 0.001). When assessing the risk of 30-day complications, RAI-rev significantly outperformed mFI-5 (AUC: 0.6016 and 0.5542 respectively, p = 0.022) but not age. Notably, RAI-rev demonstrated superior ability for predicting 30-day mortality compared to mFI-5 and age (AUC: 0.6541, 0.5652, and 0.5515 respectively, p < 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed RAI-rev as a significant predictor of extended LOS [aOR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.13-3.38, p = 0.016] and 30-day mortality [aOR: 5.27, 95% CI: 1.73-16.06, p = 0.003] for very frail patients. Similarly, the RAI-rev significantly predicted 30-day complications for frail [aOR: 2.63, 95% CI: 1.21-5.72, p = 0.015] and very frail [aOR: 3.69, 95% CI: 1.60-8.51, p = 0.002] patients.

We accessed ED encounters from our health system from January to September 2023. We developed an ensemble model using natural language processing and machine learning techniques to predict billing codes from clinical notes combined with clinical characteristics and orders. Explainable AI techniques were used to help determine the important model features. The main endpoint was to predict evaluation and management professional billing codes (levels 2 to 5 [Current Procedural Terminology codes 99282 to 99285] and critical care). Secondary endpoints included predicting professional billing codes at different decision boundary thresholds and generalizability of the model at other EDs. There were 321,893 adult ED encounters coded at levels 2 (<1%), 3 (5%), 4 (38%), 5 (51%), and critical care (5%). Model performance for professional billing code levels of 4 and 5 yielded area under the receiver operating characteristic curve values of 0.94 and 0.95, accuracy values of 0.80 and 0.92, and F1-scores of 0.79 and 0.91, respectively. At a 95% decision boundary threshold, level 5 predicted charts had a precision/positive predictive value of 0.99 and recall/sensitivity of 0.57. The most important features using Shapley Additive Explanations values were critical care note, number of orders, discharge disposition, cardiology, and psychiatry. Currently available AI models accurately predict billing code levels for ED encounters based on clinical notes, clinical characteristics, and orders.

The primary outcomes were HAIs per CDC/National Healthcare Safety Network surveillance definitions. Machine learning algorithms, balanced with Random Over Sampling Examples (ROSE), were utilized for predictive modeling, including generalized linear models (GLM); generalized additive models for location, scale, and shape (GAMLSS); random forest; support vector machine; and extreme gradient boosting (XGboost). 125 of 6,253 patients (2%) developed HAIs and 920,489 HH opportunities (49.3% compliance) were analyzed. A direct correlation between HH compliance and HAIs was observed. The GLM algorithm with ROSE demonstrated superior performance, with 84.2% sensitivity, 82.9% specificity, and a 93% AUC.

The endpoint was new-onset CKD, defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 during the follow-up period. Predictors of new-onset CKD were selected using multivariable Cox regression and a stepwise approach. A risk prediction model based on the selected predictors was constructed and evaluated using the concordance index (C-index) and area under curve (AUC). External validation was conducted to verify the model's performance. During the median follow-up period of 2.3 years, the incident of new-onset CKD was 20.1% (n = 1,088). Age, female gender, diabetes, elevated triglyceride levels, and baseline eGFR were selected as predictors. The model demonstrated good predictive performance across the cohort, with a C-index of 0.802. The AUCs for 2-year, 3-year, and 4-year predictions were 0.831, 0.829, and 0.839, respectively. External validation confirmed the model's efficacy, with a 2-year AUC of 0.735. This study developed a simple yet effective risk prediction model for new-onset CKD among elderly populations.

In this prospective, single-center study, consecutive patients with AS were screened with [99mTc]-3,3-diphosphono-1,2-propanodicarboxylic acid ([99mTc]-DPD) for the presence of ATTR-CM. Clinical, laboratory, electrocardiogram, echocardiography, invasive measurements, 4-dimensional cardiac CT (4D-CCT) strain data, and CT-radiomic features were used for machine learning modeling of ATTR-CM detection and for outcome prediction. Feature selection and classifier algorithms were applied in single- and multi-modality classification scenarios. We split the dataset into training (70%) and testing (30%) samples. Performance was assessed using various metrics across 100 random seeds. Out of 263 patients with severe AS (57% males, age 83 ± 4.6years) enrolled, ATTR-CM was confirmed in 27 (10.3%). The lowest performances for detection of concomitant ATTR-CM were observed in invasive measurements and ECG data with area under the curve (AUC) < 0.68. Individual clinical, laboratory, interventional imaging, and CT-radiomics-based features showed moderate performances (AUC 0.70-0.76, sensitivity 0.79-0.82, specificity 0.63-0.72), echocardiography demonstrated good performance (AUC 0.79, sensitivity 0.80, specificity 0.78), and 4D-CT-strain showed the highest performance (AUC 0.85, sensitivity 0.90, specificity 0.74). The multi-modality model (AUC 0.84, sensitivity 0.87, specificity 0.76) did not outperform the model performance based on 4D-CT-strain only data (p-value > 0.05). The multi-modality model adequately discriminated low and high-risk individuals for all-cause mortality at a mean follow-up of 13 months.

Immature coping strategies can worsen mental health outcomes. This study utilised a two-wave cross-sectional survey design with data collected from Chinese youth aged 14-25 years. Wave 1 (N = 3038) and Wave 2 (N = 539) datasets were used for model development and external validation, respectively. Twenty-five features, encompassing dimensions related to demographic information, stressful life events, social support, coping strategies, and emotional intelligence, were input into the model to predict the mental health status of youth, which was considered their coping outcome. Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) was used to determine the importance of each risk factor in the feature selection. The intersection of top 10 features identified by random forest and XGBoost were considered the most influential predictors of mental health during the feature selection process, and was then taken as the final set of features for model development. Machine learning models, including logistic regression, AdaBoost, and a backpropagation neural network (BPNN), were trained to predict the outcomes. The optimum model was selected according to the performance in both internal and external validation. This study identified six key features that were significantly associated with mental health outcomes: punishment, adaptation issues, self-regulation of emotions, learning pressure, use of social support, and recognition of others' emotions. The BPNN model, optimized through feature selection methods like SHAP, demonstrated superior performance in internal validation (C-index [95 % CI] = 0.9120 [0.9111, 0.9129], F-score [95 % CI] = 0.8861 [0.8853, 0.8869]). Additionally, external validation showed the model had strong discrimination (C-index = 0.9749, F-score = 0.8442) and calibration (Brier score = 0.029) capabilities. Although the clinical prediction model performed well, the study it still limited by self-reported data and representativeness of samples. Causal relationships need to be established to interpret the coping mechanism from multiple perspectives. Also, the limited data on minority groups may lead to algorithmic unfairness. Machine learning models effectively identified and predicted mental health outcomes among youths, with the SHAP+BPNN model showing promising clinical applicability. These findings emphasise the importance and effectiveness of targeted interventions with the help of clinical prediction model.","2025","Journal of affective disorders"

We have shown that the widely used Caprini (30 risk factors) and Padua (11 risk factors) VTE risk-assessment models (RAMs) have limited predictive ability for VTE when used for all general hospital admissions. Here, we test whether combining the risk factors from all 23 available VTE RAMs improves VTE risk prediction. We analyzed data from the first hospitalizations of 1,282,014 surgical and non-surgical patients admitted to 1298 Veterans Affairs facilities nationwide between January 2016 and December 2021. We used logistic regression to predict VTE within 90 days of admission using risk factors from all 23 available VTE RAMs. Area under the receiver operating characteristic curves (AUC), sensitivity, specificity, and positive (PPV) and negative predictive values (NPV) were used to quantify the predictive power of our models. The metrics were computed at two diagnostic thresholds that maximized (1) the value of sensitivity + specificity-1; and (2) PPV and were compared using McNemar's test. The Delong-Delong test was used to compare AUCs. After excluding those with missing data, 1,185,633 patients (mean age, 66 years; 93% male; and 72% White) were analyzed, of whom 33,253 (2.8%) had a VTE (deep venous thrombosis [DVT], n = 19,218, 1.6%; pulmonary embolism [PE], n = 10,190, 0.9%; PE + DVT, n = 3845, 0.3%). Our composite RAM included 102 risk factors and improved prediction of VTE compared with the Caprini RAM risk factors (AUC composite model: 0.74; AUC Caprini risk-factor model: 0.63; P < .0001). When the sum of sensitivity and specificity-1 was maximized, the composite model demonstrated small improvements in sensitivity, specificity and PPV; NPV was high in both models. When PPV was maximized, the PPV of the composite model was improved but remained low. The nature of the relationship between NPV and PPV precluded any further gain in PPV by sacrificing NPV and sensitivity. Using a composite of 102 risk factors from all available VTE RAMs, we improved VTE prediction in a large, national cohort of >1 million general hospital admissions. However, neither model has a sensitivity or PPV that permits it to be a reliable predictor of VTE. We demonstrate the limits of currently available VTE risk prediction tools; no available RAM is ready for widespread use in the general hospital population.","2025","Journal of vascular surgery.

However, the pathophysiology of narcolepsy type 2 (NT2) and idiopathic hypersomnia (IH) remains controversial. The neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio (NLR) is an easily calculated parameter from the white blood cell count, which has already been extensively used as an inflammatory marker in immunological disorders. In this study, we examined the white blood cell count of patients with NT1, NT2, and IH compared to healthy controls (HC) and evaluated the NLR to test the possibility of identifying an easy biofluid marker for detecting inflammation and distinguishing patients from HC. White blood cell count and NLR were compared between 28 patients with NT1, 17 with NT2, 11 with IH, and 21 sex/age-matched HC. These parameters were correlated with cerebrospinal fluid levels of orexin-A, the cerebrospinal fluid/serum albumin ratio (as a marker of blood-brain barrier integrity), and polysomnographic parameters. Patients with NT1 (NLR 2.01 ± 0.44) showed significantly higher NLR than those with NT2 (NLR 1.59 ± 0.53) or IH (NLR 1.48 ± 0.37) and HC (NLR 1.48 ± 0.43). Correlation analysis did not document significant associations between NLR and the other biological markers in each group of patients. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis detected an optimal cutoff value to discriminate patients with NT1 from those with NT2, IH, and HC for values of NLR ≥ 1.60, 1.62, and 1.59, respectively. Patients with NT1 showed a higher NLR than those with NT2, IH, and HC, possibly reflecting lymphocyte migration within the central nervous system, supporting the hypothesis of a neuroinflammatory attack of lymphocytes against orexin-producing neurons.

The Belun AHI (B-AHI) was moderately correlated with the PSG AHI (P-AHI) (r = .63, P < .001) with mean difference (standard deviation) -7.8 (13.91) events/h. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of the B-AHI to identify moderate-to-severe OSA (P-AHI > 5 events/h) was 0.66, and the B-AHI cut-off of 3 events/h yielded 74.1% sensitivity and 52.4% specificity. The B-AHI cut-off of 2 events/h yielded 92.6% sensitivity, and 7 events/h yielded 95.2% specificity. Despite the correlation, the difference in AHI between the Belun ring and PSG in children was noted.

This systematic review aimed to assess different androgen measures [including total testosterone (TT), calculated free testosterone (cFT), free androgen index (FAI), androstenedione (A4), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), and dihydrotestosterone (DHT)] for accuracy in diagnosing biochemical hyperandrogenism in women with PCOS, to inform the 2023 International PCOS Evidence-based Guidelines. To update evidence from the 2018 International PCOS Guidelines, a systematic search from 3 July 2017 to 23 June 2023 was conducted across Medline (Ovid), CINAHL, all EBM, EMBASE, and PsycInfo for articles evaluating androgens in the diagnosis of biochemical hyperandrogenism. The revised Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies (QUADAS-2) was used to assess the risk of bias and applicability. A diagnostic test accuracy meta-analysis was performed using STATA 18 software. Summary sensitivity and specificity were calculated with 95% CIs using the bivariate model, while the hierarchical summary receiver operating characteristics (ROC) model was used to produce a summary ROC curve. Of 23 studies reviewed, 18 were included in the meta-analysis, with data from 2857 participants (1650 with PCOS and 1207 controls). For diagnosing biochemical hyperandrogenism in PCOS, the pooled sensitivity, specificity, and AUC with 95% CI were for TT: 0.74 (0.63-0.82), 0.86 (0.77-0.91), and 0.87 (0.84-0.90); cFT: 0.89 (0.69-0.96), 0.83 (0.79-0.86), and 0.85 (0.81-0.88); FAI: 0.78 (0.70-0.83), 0.85 (0.76-0.90), and 0.87 (0.84-0.90); A4: 0.75 (0.60-0.86), 0.71 (0.51-0.85), and 0.80 (0.76-0.83); and DHEAS: 0.75 (0.61-0.85), 0.67 (0.48-0.81), and 0.77 (0.73-0.81), respectively. In subgroup analyses, liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) had superior sensitivity for measuring cFT, FAI, A4, and DHEAS, and superior specificity for measuring TT, cFT, and FAI, compared to the direct immunoassay method. Our results directly informed the 2023 International PCOS Guideline recommendations to use TT and FT as the first-line laboratory tests to assess biochemical hyperandrogenism in the diagnosis of PCOS. cFT should be assessed by equilibrium dialysis or ammonium sulfate precipitation, or calculated using FAI. If TT or cFT are not elevated, A4 and DHEAS could also be considered, noting their poorer specificity. Laboratories should utilize LC-MS/MS for androgen measurement given its high accuracy. Future studies should focus on establishing optimal normative cut-off values in large, unselected, and ethnically diverse cohorts of women. The review protocol was prepublished in the 2023 PCOS Guideline Technical Report (https://www.monash.edu/__data/assets/pdf_file/0010/3379591/TechnicalReport-2023.pdf).","2025","Human reproduction update"

In this retrospective casecontrol study, the case group consisted of 210 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) who developed MACEs within five years, and the control group consisted of 210 CAD patients without MACEs who were matched with the case group patients according to baseline characteristics. Both groups were divided into training and testing cohorts at an 8:2 ratio. After data standardization and the exclusion of features with Pearson correlation coefficients of |r| ≥ 0.9, independent logistic regression models were constructed using selected radiomics features of the proximal PCAT of the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, left circumflex (LCX) artery, and right coronary artery (RCA) via least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) techniques. An integrated PCAT radiomics model including all three coronary arteries was also developed. Five models, including individual PCAT radiomics models for the LAD artery, LCX artery, and RCA; an integrated radiomics model; and a fat attenuation index (FAI) model, were assessed for diagnostic accuracy via receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curves. Compared with the FAI model (AUC=0.564 in training, 0.518 in testing), the integrated radiomics model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance (area under the curve [AUC]=0.923 in training, 0.871 in testing). The AUC values of the integrated model were greater than those of the individual coronary radiomics models, with all the models showing goodness of fit (P > 0.05). The decision curves indicated greater clinical utility of the radiomics models than the FAI model. PCAT radiomics models derived from CCTA data are highly valuable for predicting future MACE risk and significantly outperform the FAI model.","2025","Academic radiology"

Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence, particularly large language models (LLMs), create opportunities to support accurate identification of clinical conditions. In this study, we present the first LLM-based pipeline for identification of overt GIB in the electronic health record (EHR). We demonstrate 2 clinically relevant applications: the automated detection of recurrent bleeding and appropriate reimbursement coding for patients with GIB. Development of the LLM-based pipeline was performed on 17,712 nursing notes from 1108 patients who were hospitalized with acute GIB and underwent endoscopy in the hospital from 2014 to 2023. The pipeline was used to train an EHR-based machine learning model for detection of recurrent bleeding on 546 patients presenting to 2 hospitals and externally validated on 562 patients presenting to 4 different hospitals. The pipeline was used to develop an algorithm for appropriate reimbursement coding on 7956 patients who underwent endoscopy in the hospital from 2019 to 2023. The LLM-based pipeline accurately detected melena (positive predictive value, 0.972; sensitivity, 0.900), hematochezia (positive predictive value, 0.900; sensitivity, 0.908), and hematemesis (positive predictive value, 0.859; sensitivity, 0.932). The EHR-based machine learning model identified recurrent bleeding with area under the curve of 0.986, sensitivity of 98.4%, and specificity of 97.5%. The reimbursement coding algorithm resulted in an average per-patient reimbursement increase of $1299 to $3247 with a total difference of $697,460 to $1,743,649. An LLM-based pipeline can robustly detect overt GIB in the EHR with clinically relevant applications in detection of recurrent bleeding and appropriate reimbursement coding.","2025","Gastroenterology"

We aimed to identify the factors that predict in-hospital mortality in patients with CS requiring Impella and develop a new risk prediction model. We utilized the J-PVAD registry, which includes all cases where Impella was implanted in Japan. Two-thirds of the patients in the J-PVAD registry were randomly assigned to the derivation cohort (n = 1701), and the other third was assigned to the validation cohort (n = 850). A backward stepwise logistic regression model was developed to identify factors associated with in-hospital mortality. In the derivation cohort, 956 patients were discharged alive, and 745 patients (43.8%) died during hospitalization. Among 29 candidate variables, 12 were independently associated with in-hospital mortality and were applied as components of the risk model, including age, sex, body mass index, fulminant myocarditis aetiology, cardiac arrest in hospital, baseline veno-arterial extracorporeal membrane oxygenation use, mean arterial pressure, lactate, lactate dehydrogenase, total bilirubin, creatinine, and albumin levels. The comparison of predicted and observed in-hospital mortality according to the 7th quantiles using the J-PVAD risk score showed good calibration. The area under the curve for the J-PVAD risk score was 0.76 (95% confidence interval 0.73-0.78). In the validation cohort, the J-PVAD risk score showed good calibration and discrimination ability. The J-PVAD risk score can be calculated using variables easily obtained in routine clinical practice. It helps the accurate stratification of mortality risk and facilitates clinical decision-making.","2025","European journal of heart failure"

Our purpose was to establish the PASS for the numeric rating scale (NRS) for pain in a 1-year postoperative hand surgery population. This retrospective study included adult patients undergoing non-shoulder upper-extremity surgery at a single, tertiary medical center identified over a 9-month period. At 1 year after surgery, NRS pain and responses to a pain-specific anchor question were collected. Patients were dichotomized based on achieving ""PASS(+)"" or failing to achieve ""PASS(-)"" an acceptable symptom state based upon their response to a pain-specific anchor question. Threshold values of a PASS(+) state were calculated for the NRS pain score using the following three methods: (1) mean score of PASS(+) patients, (2) Tubach method (75th percentile threshold for PASS(+) patients), and (3) the Youden index (receiver operating curve analysis to maximize sensitivity and specificity). Of 233 included patients, mean age was 54 years (±17), and 58% (n = 136) were women. Mean NRS pain scores differed between PASS(+) and PASS(-) patients (0.7 ± 1.2 vs 3.8 ± 2.7, respectively). PASS(-) patients were more likely to be non-White and have a diagnosed psychiatric comorbidity. Patient-acceptable symptom state estimates ranged from 0.73 to 2.1 for NRS pain, depending on the calculation method (0.73 for the mean score method, 1.0 for the Tubach method, and 2.1 for the Youden index). The area under the curve for the Youden index method was 0.86 consistent with excellent discrimination. We propose the value of 2.1 to represent the PASS threshold for the NRS pain score in this population. This PASS value should be used when interpreting NRS pain score outcomes at a population level. This threshold is expected to yield excellent discrimination for patient satisfaction when applied to a postoperative hand surgery population.","2025","The Journal of hand surgery"

Here, we test whether BD-PRS improves performance of a previously published risk calculator (RC) for BD. 156 parents with BD-I/II and their offspring ages 6-18 were recruited and evaluated with standardized diagnostic assessments every two years for >12 years. DNA was extracted from saliva samples, genotyping performed, and BD-PRS calculated based on a 2021 meta-analysis. Using a bootstrapped and cross-validated penalized Cox regression, we assessed whether BD-PRS (alone and interacting with clinical variables) improved RC performance. Of 227 offspring, 38 developed BD during follow-up. The penalized regression selected BD-PRS and interactions between BD-PRS and parental age at mood disorder onset (AAO), depression, and anxiety. The resulting RC discriminated offspring who developed BD (vs. those that did not) with good accuracy (AUC = 0.81); removing BD-PRS and its interaction terms was associated with a significant decrement to the AUC (decrement = 0.07, p = 0.039). Further exploration of selected interaction terms indicated that all were significant (p-values<0.02), indicating that BD-PRS has a larger effect on the outcome in offspring with depression and anxiety, whose affected parent had a younger AAO. The addition of BD-PRS to clinical/demographic predictors in the RC significantly improved its accuracy. BD-PRS predicted BD on the person-level, particularly in offspring of parents with earlier AAO who already had symptoms of anxiety and depression at intake.","2025","Journal of affective disorders"

One such model is the Contrast Avoidance Model (CAM), which posits that individuals with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) are sensitive to sharp increases in emotions, and use worry to maintain heightened states of negative arousal to avoid these emotional shifts. The current study used receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve analyses to examine the predictive utility of two contrast avoidance questionnaires in detecting probable OCD. Undergraduate students (N = 2880) completed measures of contrast avoidance (CAQ-GE and CAQ-W) and obsessive-compulsive symptoms. A subset of participants were selected for the probable OCD group (n = 431) and the non-OCD group (n = 433). Results showed significant differences in total CAQ-GE and CAQ-W scores between the probable OCD group and the non-OCD group. Area under the curve values demonstrated excellent accuracy in predicting probable OCD on the CAQ-GE and CAQ-W, (.87 and .88, respectively). Correlation analyses for the entire screening sample revealed that certain OC symptom dimensions (e.g., Unacceptable Thoughts; Responsibility for Harm) were more closely associated with the CAQ-GE and the CAQ-W relative to other symptom dimensions. The study had a cross-sectional design and relied on an undergraduate sample. Identifying shared mechanisms across OCD and its comorbidities is an important and novel approach to understanding the etiology and maintenance of symptoms.","2025","Journal of affective disorders"

Simnotrelvir is a substrate of cytochrome P450 3A (CYP3A) and P-glycoprotein (P-gp), and a weak inhibitor of CYP3A. Ritonavir is a substrate and inhibitor of CYP3A and an inhibitor of P-gp. Hence, the drug-drug interaction potential of simnotrelvir/ritonavir should be investigated. This drug-drug interaction study was an open-label, fixed-sequence, two-period phase I clinical trial in Chinese healthy adult subjects, divided into three cohorts, including simnotrelvir/ritonavir co-administrated with a strong CYP3A and P-gp inhibitor (itraconazole) and inducer (rifampicin), and with a specific CYP3A substrate (midazolam). The results demonstrated that compared with administration of simnotrelvir/ritonavir alone, the co-administration with itraconazole increased the geometric least-square mean ratio (GMR) of the expose (area under the plasma concentration-time curve from time zero to the lowest detectable plasma concentration [AUC0-t]) of simnotrelvir by 25% (GMR 125%, 90% CI 114-137%), whereas co-administration with rifampicin significantly decreased the AUC0-t of simnotrelvir by 81.5% (GMR 18.5%, 90% CI 16.4-20.9%). Notably, simnotrelvir/ritonavir increased the AUC0-t of midazolam by 16.69-fold (GMR 1769%, 90% CI 1551-2018%). The co-administration of simnotrelvir/ritonavir and rifampicin caused the increased amount and severity of treatment-emergent adverse events, especially hepatotoxicity. The co-administration of simnotrelvir/ritonavir with CYP3A and P-gp inhibitors can be safely used, whereas the co-administration with CYP3A and P-gp strong inducer should be avoided to minimize the risk of under-exposure. Co-administration of midazolam with simnotrelvir/ritonavir increased systemic exposure of midazolam. gov Identifier: NCT05665647.","2025","Clinical microbiology and infection : the official publication of the European Society of Clinical Microbiology and Infectious Diseases"

Worldwide, PFAS bioaccumulation causes serious adverse health impacts, yet the physiochemical determinants of bioaccumulation and toxicity for most PFAS are not well understood, largely due to experimental data deficiencies. As most PFAS are proteinophilic, protein binding is a critical parameter for predicting PFAS bioaccumulation and toxicity. Among these proteins, human serum albumin (HSA) is the predominant blood transport protein for many PFAS. We previously demonstrated the utility of an in vitro differential scanning fluorimetry assay for determining relative HSA binding affinities for 24 PFAS. Here, we report HSA affinities for 65 structurally diverse PFAS from 20 chemical classes. We leverage these experimental data, and chemical/molecular descriptors of PFAS, to build 7 machine learning classifier algorithms and 9 regression algorithms, and evaluate their performance to identify the best predictive binding models. Evaluation of model accuracy revealed that the top-performing classifier model, logistic regression, had an AUROC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve) statistic of 0.936. The top-performing regression model, support vector regression, had an R2 of 0.854. These top-performing models were then used to predict HSA-PFAS binding for chemicals in the EPAPFASINV list of 430 PFAS. These developed in vitro and in silico methodologies represent a high-throughput framework for predicting protein-PFAS binding based on empirical data, and generate directly comparable binding data of potential use in predictive modeling of PFAS bioaccumulation and other toxicokinetic endpoints.","2025","Toxicological sciences : an official journal of the Society of Toxicology"

Additionally, 224 cases from four cohorts obtained from the Cancer Imaging Archive, all diagnosed with non-small cell lung cancer, were included for external validation. The deep learning model, built on the MobileNetV3 architecture, was assessed in both internal and external validation sets using metrics such as accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The model's prognostic value was further analyzed using Cox proportional hazards models. The model achieved high accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and AUC in the internal validation set (accuracy: 0.888, macro AUC: 0.968, macro sensitivity: 0.798, macro specificity: 0.956). External validation demonstrated comparable performance (accuracy: 0.807, macro AUC: 0.920, macro sensitivity: 0.799, macro specificity: 0.896).

This retrospective study included inpatients aged ≥60 years diagnosed with chronic HF at a teaching hospital in western China. General data on the patients were collected from the electronic medical record system between January 1, 2017, and July 7, 2022, and death information was obtained from follow-up calls made from July 31, 2022, to August 1, 2022. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were used to analyze the accuracy of the FI in predicting death in patients with chronic HF. Logistic regression (during hospitalization and within 30 days after discharge) and Cox regression (within 180 days after discharge and one year after discharge) analyses were used to assess associations between frailty and mortality risk in elderly patients with chronic HF. A total of 432 patients with chronic HF were included in the study. The non-frail group had FI values <0.3, while the FI values in the frail group were ≥0.3. Overall, 130 patients (30.09 %) were diagnosed with frailty, 66 (15.28 %) died during hospitalization or within 30 days after discharge, 55 (12.73 %) died within 180 days after discharge, and 68 (15.74 %) died within one year after discharge. The in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates, the 180-day mortality rates, and the 1-year mortality rates were higher in frail patients than in non-frail patients (in-hospital and 30-day mortality rates, 37.69 % vs. 5.63 %, P < 0.001; within 180 days, 30.61 % vs. 8.45 %, P < 0.001; within 1 year, 34.69 % vs. 11.49 %, P < 0.001).

Logistic regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders indicated that frail HF patients had a higher risk of death during hospitalization and within 30 days than non-frail patients (odds ratio [OR] = 4.98, 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 2.46-10.09). Cox regression analysis with adjustment for potential confounders showed that frail HF patients had a higher risk of death within 180 days (hazard ratio [HR] = 2.63, 95 %CI: 1.47-4.72) and within 1 year (HR = 2.01, 95 %CI: 1.19-3.38). The results of this study showed that the new FI constructed according to the established construction rules could predict the in-hospital mortality and the risk of death within 30 days after discharge, 180 days after discharge, and 1 year after discharge in patients with chronic HF.","2025","Archives of gerontology and geriatrics"

Thirty-five unmedicated patients with MDD and 35 healthy controls (HCs) were enrolled, and plasma ADEVs were isolated from each participant. VEGF levels in ADEVs and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in plasma were measured. Additionally, Alix and CD81, two established extracellular vesicle markers, were quantified in ADEVs. At baseline, MDD patients exhibited significantly increased levels of VEGF in ADEVs and GFAP in plasma. Following four weeks of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor treatment, these target protein levels did not significantly change. ROC curve analysis revealed an AUC of 0.711 for VEGF in ADEVs. In exploratory analysis, VEGF levels in ADEVs were positively correlated with Alix and CD81. Multiple factors regulate BBB permeability. This study focused solely on VEGF and the sample size for longitudinal analysis was relatively small.

Remarkably, the PCa diagnosis accuracy of patients with PI-RADS 3 was more than twice that of conventional PI-RADS scoring. Our system also provided a reasonable explanation of its decision that TMEM256 biomarker is the leading factor for screening those with PI-RADS 3. Our study implies that XAI can facilitate informed decisions, guided by insights into the significance of visualized multi-biomarkers and clinical factors.

However, the detailed pathogenesis of gout is complex and not fully clear. We investigated the urine metabolic profiling of gout patients by ultra-performance liquid chromatograph quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UPLC-Q-TOF-MS). Urine metabolites were extracted from 26 acute gout patients, 31 chronic gout patients, and 32 healthy controls. Metabolite extracts were analyzed by UPLC-Q-TOF-MS for untargeted metabolomics. The peak area of creatinine was used to correct the content variations of urine samples for the semi-quantitative analysis. The value of variable importance in the projection (VIP) was obtained through the orthogonal partial least squares-discrimination analysis (OPLS-DA), and several differential metabolites were screened out. The potential metabolic markers of gout in different stages were found based on the t-test. Finally, 18 different metabolites were identified through Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) and Targeted-MS/MS. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve results revealed that all the screened biomarkers exerted high accuracy and diagnostic value. Pathway analysis indicated that the significantly different metabolites were mainly involved in purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism. The identified potential biomarkers are mainly involved in purine metabolism and amino acid metabolism, which leads us to further explore the pathogenesis of gout. This will lead us to further explore the pathogenesis of gout and provide the basis and ideas for the prevention and treatment of gout.","2025","Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry"

A total of 319 patients who underwent MRI examination and received NAC treatment were enrolled from two centers, and the presence of ALN metastasis was confirmed by biopsy pathology before NAC. The radiomics features were extracted from regions of interest of ALNs before (pre-radiomics) and after (post-radiomics) NAC. The difference of features before and after NAC, named delta radiomics, was calculated. The variance threshold, selectKbest and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithm were used to select radiomics features. Radscore was calculated by a linear combination of selected features, weighted by their respective coefficients. The univariate and multivariate logistic regression was used to select the clinicopathological factors and radscores, and a radiomics nomogram was built by multivariable logistic regression analysis. The performance of the nomogram was evaluated by the area under the receiver operator characteristic curve (AUC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves. Furthermore, to explore the biological basis of radiomics nomogram, 16 patients with RNA-sequence data were included for genetic analysis. The radiomics nomogram was constructed by two radscores (post- and delta- radscores) and one clinicopathological factor (progesterone hormone, PR), and showed powerful predictive performance in both internal and external test sets, with AUCs of 0.894 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.877-0.959) and 0.903 (95% CI, 0.801-0.986), respectively. The calibration curves and DCA showed favorable consistency and clinical utility. With the assistance of nomogram, the rate of unnecessary ALND would be reduced from 60.42% to 21.88%, and the rate of final benefit rate would be increased from 39.58% to 70.83%. Moreover, genetic analysis revealed that high apCR prediction scores were associated with the upregulation of immune-mediated genes and pathways. The radiomics nomogram showed great performance in predicting apCR after NAC for breast cancer patients, which could help clinicians to identify patients with apCR and avoid unnecessary axillary lymph node dissection.","2025","Academic radiology"

This study aims to establish and verify a deep learning (DL) radiomics model for the prediction of LNM in OPSCCs using contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CECT). A retrospective analysis included 279 OPSCC patients from 3 institutions. CECT images were used for handcrafted (HCR) and DL feature extraction. Dimensionality reduction for HCR features used recursive feature elimination (RFE) and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) algorithms, whereas DL feature dimensionality reduction used variance-threshold and RFE algorithms. Radiomics signatures were constructed using six machine learning classifiers. A combined model was then constructed using the screened DL, HCR, and clinical features. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) served to quantify the model's performance, and calibration curves were utilized to assess its calibration. The combined model exhibited robust performance, achieving AUC values of 0.909 (95% CI, 0.861-0.957) in the training cohort, 0.884 (95% CI, 0.800-0.968) in the internal validation cohort, and 0.865 (95% CI, 0.791-0.939) in the external validation cohort. It outperformed both the clinical model and best-performing radiomics model. Moreover, calibration was deemed satisfactory. The combined model based on CECT demonstrates the potential to predict LNM in OPSCCs preoperatively, offering a valuable tool for more precise and tailored treatment strategies. This study presents a novel combined model integrating clinical factors with DL radiomics, significantly enhancing preoperative LNM prediction in OPSCC.","2025","Dento maxillo facial radiology"

In this study, 6434 older adults were selected based on the data of the China Health and Elderly Care Longitudinal Survey (CHARLS) in 2020, and the dataset was subsequently divided into the training set and the test set, with a ratio of 6:4. To construct a prediction model for MCI in older adults, six ML algorithms were used, including logistic regression, KNN, SVM, decision tree (DT), LightGBM, and random forest (RF). The Delong test was used to compare the differences of ROC curves of different models, while decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to evaluate the model performance. The important contributions of the prediction results were then used to explain the model by the SHAP value.The Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) was calculated to evaluate the performance of the models on imbalanced datasets. Additionally, causal analysis and counterfactual analysis were conducted to understand the feature importance and variable effects. The area under the ROC curve of each model range from 0.71 to 0.77, indicating significant difference (P < 0.01). The DCA results show that the net benefits of LightGBM is the largest within various probability thresholds. Among all the models, the LightGBM model demonstrated the highest performance and stability. The five most important characteristics for predicting MCI were educational level, social events, gender, relationship with children, and age. Causal analysis revealed that these variables had a significant impact on MCI, with an average treatment effect of -0.144. Counterfactual analysis further validated these findings by simulating different scenarios, such as improving educational level, increasing age, and increasing social events. The ML algorithm can effectively predict the MCI of older adults in China and identify the important factors causing MCI.","2025","Journal of affective disorders"

In this work, based on the nature of catalase-positive bacteria decomposing H2O2, we developed a rapid, portable, straightforward, and cost-effective phenotypic AST approach by detecting residual H2O2 using a Pt nanoparticles-based electrochemical sensor. The pulse current of the sensor exhibited a linear increase with rising H2O2 concentration, demonstrating a high sensitivity of ∼382.2 μA cm-2 mM-1. This approach showed superb diagnostic performance, with an area under the curve of 1 for 24 clinical samples of Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus, with a total detection time of 60 and 45 min, respectively. Furthermore, the performance of the sensor showed no degradation even after 100 detections, promising a substantial reduction in AST costs.

However, some patients require intervention shortly after diagnosis. In the past decade, several risk scores (RS) have been developed to predict disease progression, yet some patients are misclassified. On the other hand, IGHV subset 2 (IGHV2) predicts poor outcomes. A retrospective and multicentric study was conducted to compare the accuracy of five different RS (IPS-E, CR0, AIPS-E, CLL-IPI, and Barcelona-Brno) to predict disease progression in 781 stage A previously untreated patients with CLL. As an exploratory analysis, it was further investigated whether the inclusion of the IGHV2 as a poor prognostic parameter improved the accuracy of RS. All the scores identified a similar group of patients with CLL in early stage with low-, intermediate-, and high-risk progression. Discrimination was high and similar in all RS (c-index = 0.74-0.79, area under the curve = 0.7-0.75), as well as calibration (p = .98) and parsimony, although CLL-IPI showed the best results (Akaike information criterion = 441).

PSMA PET/CT can detect lesions that are not visible on MRI, and the addition of PSMA PET/CT to MRI may improve diagnostic performance. The aim of this study was to incorporate the PRIMARY score or SUVmax derived from [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT into the RC and compare these models with MRI-based RC to assess whether this can further reduce unnecessary biopsies. A total of 683 consecutive biopsy-naïve men who underwent both [68Ga]Ga-PSMA-11 PET/CT and MRI before biopsy were temporally divided into a development cohort (n = 552) and a temporal validation cohort (n = 131). Three logistic regression RCs were developed and compared: MRI-RC, MRI-SUVmax-RC and MRI-PRIMARY-RC. Discrimination, calibration, and clinical utility were evaluated. The primary outcome was the clinical utility of the risk calculators for detecting csPCa and reducing the number of negative biopsies. The prevalence of csPCa was 47.5% (262/552) in the development cohort and 41.9% (55/131) in the temporal validation cohort. In the development cohort, the AUC of MRI-PRIMARY-RC was significantly higher than that of MRI-RC (0.924 vs. 0.868, p < 0.001) and MRI-SUVmax-RC (0.924 vs. 0.904, p = 0.002). In the temporal validation cohort, MRI-PRIMARY-RC also showed the best discriminative ability with an AUC of 0.921 (95% CI: 0.873-0.969). Bootstrapped calibration curves revealed that the model fit was acceptable. MRI-PRIMARY-RC exhibited near-perfect calibration within the range of 0-40%. DCA showed that MRI-PRIMARY-RC had the greatest net benefit for detecting csPCa compared with MRI-RC and MRI-SUVmax-RC at a risk threshold of 5-40% for csPCa in both the development and validation cohorts. The addition of the PRIMARY score to MRI-based multivariable model improved the accuracy of risk stratification prior to biopsy. Our novel MRI-PRIMARY prediction model is a promising approach for reducing unnecessary biopsies and improving the early detection of csPCa.","2025","European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging"

Data included demographics, pregnancy, delivery, neonatal factors, maternal interviews, and physical and neurological findings. Diagnoses were made by paediatricians and child psychiatrists using standardised tools. Predictive accuracy was assessed by the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. We identified several infant/toddler factors significantly associated with NDD diagnoses. Predictive factors included meconium-stained amniotic fluid, 1 min Apgar score, and early developmental milestones. ROC curve analysis showed varying predictive accuracies based on evaluation timing. The 10-month checkup was valid for screening but less reliable for excluding low-risk cases. The 18-month evaluation accurately identified children at NDD risk. The study demonstrates the potential of using developmental records for early NDD detection, emphasising early monitoring and intervention for at-risk children.

We aimed to develop and validate a risk score for prognosis prediction for these patients. This was a multicenter observation study. AECOPD patients admitted to ICU were included for model derivation from a prospective, multicenter cohort study. Logistic regression analysis was applied to identify independent predictors for in-hospital death and establish the prognostic risk score. The risk score was further validated and compared with DECAF, BAP-65, CURB-65, and APACHE II score in another multicenter cohort. Five variables were identified as independent predictors for in-hospital death in APCOPD patients admitted to ICU, and a corresponding risk score (PD-ICU score) was established, which was composed of procalcitonin >0.5 μg/L, diastolic blood pressure <60 mm Hg, need for invasive mechanical ventilation, disturbance of consciousness, and blood urea nitrogen >7.2 mmol/L. Patients were classified into three risk categories according to the PD-ICU score. The in-hospital mortality of low-risk, intermediate-risk, and high-risk patients was 0.3%, 7.3%, and 27.9%, respectively. PD-ICU score displayed excellent discrimination ability with an area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) of 0.815 in the derivation cohort and 0.754 in the validation cohort which outperformed other prognostic models. We derived and validated a simple and clinician-friendly prediction model (PD-ICU score) for in-hospital mortality among AECOPD patients admitted to ICU.

Children with Staphylococcus aureus acute hematogenous osteomyelitis (n = 438) were retrospectively studied to identify adverse events and predictors of severity. The outcome of complicated osteomyelitis was ultimately defined as the occurrence of any major or at least 3 minor adverse events, which occurred in 52 children. Twenty-four clinical and laboratory predictors were evaluated through univariate and stacked multivariable regression analyses of chronologically distinct groups of variables. Receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were conducted to compare models. Accelerated Severity of Illness Score included: triage tachycardia [odds ratio: 10.2 (95% confidence interval: 3.48-32.3], triage tachypnea [6.0 (2.4-15.2)], C-reactive protein initial ≥17.2 mg/dL [4.5 (1.8-11.8)], white blood cell count band percentage initial >3.8% [4.6 (2.0-11.0)], hemoglobin initial ≤10.4 g/dL [6.0 (2.6-14.7)], methicillin-resistant S. aureus [3.0 (1.2-8.5)], septic arthritis [4.5 (1.8-12.3)] and platelet nadir [7.2 (2.7-20.4)].

To assess the potential of RCM to accurately diagnose BCC in a private UK secondary care, single-clinician setting, and to investigate the potential of RCM as a routine diagnostic procedure. In total, 522 lesions where BCC featured in the differential diagnosis after clinical examination were prospectively recruited; 78 lesions were subsequently excluded. We used an arm-mounted confocal microscope unless access to the lesion was awkward and required a handheld probe to be used. The likelihood of BCC was scored for each modality (clinical examination, dermoscopy and RCM), with each diagnosis building on the last. Histology was assessed by a single blinded histopathologist. The study was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03509415). The analysis included 444 lesions (327 BCCs) from 326 patients. The median maximum lesion diameter was 6 mm. The sensitivity and specificity for BCC were 69.4% [95% confidence interval (CI) 64.1-74.4] and 53.0% (95% CI 43.6-62.3), respectively, for clinical examination alone; 91.8% (95% CI 88.3-94.5) and 41.0% (95% CI 32.0-50.5), respectively, for clinical examination plus dermoscopy; and 98.8% (95% CI 96.9-99.7) and 85.5% (95% CI 77.8-91.3), respectively, for clinical examination plus dermoscopy plus RCM. For RCM, the positive predictive value in diagnosing BCC was 95.0% (95% CI 92.1-97.1) and the negative predictive value was 96.2% (95% CI 90.4-98.9). The area under the curve increased from 0.61 to 0.66 to 0.92 as the respective modalities were added. This study demonstrates that RCM can reliably and quickly diagnose BCC, and that the addition of RCM to dermoscopy permits higher diagnostic accuracy for BCC in the UK.

Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity were also investigated as adverse effects in correlation with TDM parameters. Among 65 patients, the mean and median values of AUC24 were 234 and 249 mg·hr/L, respectively. In a group of patients with AUC24 values less than 250 mg·hr/L, 42.4 % of patients were re-admitted for pulmonary symptoms. On the contrary, another group with AUC24 values equal to or more than 250 mg·hr/L, had lower re-admission rates (25.0 %). They also showed lower all-cause mortality rates and more improvement on acid-fast bacilli smear results. Moderate to poor correlation between AUC24 values and peak/trough levels were observed. Ototoxicity and nephrotoxicity were revealed to be associated with drug exposure duration rather than AUC24 values. In this study, we performed comparative assessment of trough/peak level, traditional clinical marker for amikacin TDM, and AUC24 value.

XGBoost models were trained for both automated measurements and manual labels for iNPH prediction. A total of 452 patients (200 men; mean age, 73.2 [SD, 6.5] years) were included in the training set. Of the 452 patients, 111 (24.6%) had iNPH. We obtained area under the curve (AUC) values of 0.956 for automatically measured high-convexity tightness and 0.830 for Sylvian fissure enlargement. Intraclass correlation values of 0.824 for the callosal angle and 0.924 for the Evans index were measured. By means of the decision tree of the XGBoost model, the model trained on manual labels obtained an average cross-validation AUC of 0.988 on the training set and 0.938 on the unseen test set, while the fully automated model obtained a cross-validation AUC of 0.983 and an unseen test AUC of 0.936. We demonstrated a machine learning algorithm capable of diagnosing iNPH from a 3D T1-weighted MRI that is robust to the failure. We propose a method to scan large numbers of 3D T1-weighted MRIs with minimal human intervention, making possible large-scale iNPH screening.","2025","AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology"

We aimed to generate a predictive model of long-term cancer-related behavioral symptoms clusters among breast cancer survivors 4 years after diagnosis. Patients with early-stage breast cancer were included from the CANcer TOxicity trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier NCT01993498). Our outcome was the proportion of patients reporting cancer-related behavioral symptoms clusters 4 years after diagnosis (≥3 severe symptoms). Predictors, including clinical, behavioral, and treatment-related characteristics; Behavioral Symptoms Score (BSS; 1 point per severe cancer-related behavioral symptom at diagnosis); and a proinflammatory cytokine (interleukin 1b; interleukin 6; tumor necrosis factor α) genetic risk score were tested using multivariable logistic regression, implementing bootstrapped augmented backwards elimination. A 2-sided P less than .05 defined statistical significance. In the development cohort (n = 3555), 642 patients (19.1%) reported a cluster of cancer-related behavioral symptoms at diagnosis, and 755 (21.2%) did so 4 years after diagnosis. Younger age (adjusted odds ratio for 1-year decrement = 1.012, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.003 to 1.020), previous psychiatric disorders (adjusted odds ratio vs no = 1.27, 95% CI = 1.01 to 1.60), and BSS (adjusted odds ratio ranged from 2.17 [95% CI = 1.66 to 2.85] for BSS = 1 vs 0 to 12.3 [95% CI = 7.33 to 20.87] for BSS = 5 vs 0) were predictors of reporting a cluster of cancer-related behavioral symptoms (area under the curve = 0.73, 95% CI = 0.71 to 0.75). Genetic risk score was not predictive of these symptoms. Results were confirmed in the validation cohort (n = 1533). Younger patients with previous psychiatric disorders and higher baseline symptom burden have greater risk of long-term clusters of cancer-related behavioral symptoms. Our model might be implemented in clinical pathways to improve management and test the effectiveness of risk-mitigation interventions among breast cancer survivors.","2025","Journal of the National Cancer Institute"
1573,"39250560","Polygenic Score for the Prediction of Postoperative Nausea and Vomiting: A Retrospective Derivation and Validation Cohort Study.","Postoperative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is a key driver of unplanned admission and patient satisfaction after surgery. Because traditional risk factors do not completely explain variability in risk, this study hypothesized that genetics may contribute to the overall risk for this complication. The objective of this research is to perform a genome-wide association study of PONV, derive a polygenic risk score for PONV, assess associations between the risk score and PONV in a validation cohort, and compare any genetic contributions to known clinical risks for PONV. Surgeries with integrated genetic and perioperative data performed under general anesthesia at Michigan Medicine (Ann Arbor, Michigan) and Vanderbilt University Medical Center (Nashville, Tennessee) were studied. PONV was defined as nausea or emesis occurring and documented in the postanesthesia care unit. In the discovery phase, genome-wide association studies were performed on each genetic cohort, and the results were meta-analyzed. Next, the polygenic phase assessed whether a polygenic score, derived from genome-wide association study in a derivation cohort from Vanderbilt University Medical Center, improved prediction within a validation cohort from Michigan Medicine, as quantified by discrimination (c-statistic) and net reclassification index. Of 64,523 total patients, 5,703 developed PONV (8.8%). The study identified 46 genetic variants exceeding the threshold of P < 1 × 10-5, occurring with minor allele frequency greater than 1%, and demonstrating concordant effects in both cohorts. Standardized polygenic score was associated with PONV in a basic model, controlling for age and sex (adjusted odds ratio, 1.027 per SD increase in overall genetic risk; 95% CI, 1.001 to 1.053; P = 0.044), a model based on known clinical risks (adjusted odds ratio, 1.029; 95% CI, 1.003 to 1.055; P = 0.030), and a full clinical regression, controlling for 21 demographic, surgical, and anesthetic factors, (adjusted odds ratio, 1.029; 95% CI, 1.002 to 1.056; P = 0.033). The addition of polygenic score improved overall discrimination in models based on known clinical risk factors (c-statistic, 0.616 compared to 0.613; P = 0.028) and improved net reclassification of 4.6% of cases. Standardized polygenic risk was associated with PONV in all three of the study's models, but the genetic influence was smaller than exerted by clinical risk factors. Specifically, a patient with a polygenic risk score greater than 1 SD above the mean has 2 to 3% greater odds of developing PONV when compared to the baseline population, which is at least an order of magnitude smaller than the increase associated with having prior PONV or motion sickness (55%), having a history of migraines (17%), or being female (83%) and is not clinically significant. Furthermore, the use of a polygenic risk score does not meaningfully improve discrimination compared to clinical risk factors and is not clinically useful.","2025","Anesthesiology"

This study aims to investigate if serum NSE concentration is related to the clinical features of anti-NMDAR encephalitis. Serum NSE levels were detected in 58 anti-NMDAR encephalitis cases, 58 matched healthy controls and 58 matched disease controls. Demographic features, clinical symptoms, cerebrospinal fluid parameters and brain MRI indexes of the cases were evaluated. Serum NSE concentrations were significant higher in case group than those in healthy controls and disease controls (both p < 0.001). Serum NSE concentrations in patients with mRS≥3 one year after onset were obviously higher than in those with mRS<3 (p < 0.001). Patients with status epilepticus or central hypoventilation had higher serum NSE levels than those without (p = 0.003 and p = 0.006). Serum NSE concentrations in cases with brain lesions or brain atrophy were significant higher than in those without (p = 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). Serum NSE concentrations were found to be significant higher in cases with limited response to treatment compared to those with favourable therapy outcomes (p < 0.001). Spearman's correlation analysis showed a significant positive association between serum NSE concentration and mRS score at the most critical time (max mRS) (r = 0.575, p < 0.001) and one year after onset (r = 0.705, p < 0.001). Cox regression results reflected that high serum NSE level was an independent predictor of poor prognosis in anti-NMDAR encephalitis group (p = 0.001), and the ROC curve threshold value was 15.72 ng/ml. Serum NSE concentrations in anti-NMDAR encephalitis cases are higher than those in controls.

In our endeavor, we conducted a comprehensive bibliometric analysis to delve into the landscape of TCM research within the realm of neurodegenerative diseases, aiming to uncover the present scenario, breadth, and trends in this field. This analysis presents potentially valuable insights for the clinical application of traditional Chinese medicine and provides compelling evidence supporting its efficacy in the treatment of neurodegenerative conditions. The incidence of neurodegenerative diseases is on the rise, yet effective treatments are still lacking. Research indicates that TCM could offer novel perspectives for addressing neurodegenerative conditions. Nonetheless, the literature on this topic is intricate and multifaceted, with existing reviews offering only limited coverage. To gain a thorough understanding of TCM research in neurodegenerative diseases, we undertook a bibliometric analysis to explore the current status, scope, and trends in this area. A literature search was carried out on April 1, 2024, utilizing the Web of Science Core Collection (WoSCC). Visualization and quantitative analyses were then performed with the assistance of CiteSpace, VOSviewer, and R software. A total of 6856 articles were retrieved in the search. Research on TCM for neurodegenerative diseases commenced in 1989 and has exhibited a notable overall growth since then. Main research contributors include East Asian countries like China, as well as the United States. Through our analysis, we identified 15 highly productive authors, 10 top-tier journals, 13 citation clusters, 11 influential articles, and observed a progression in keyword evolution across 4 distinct categories. In 2020, there was a significant upsurge in the knowledge base, collaboration efforts, and publication output within the field. This field is interdisciplinary: network pharmacology emerges as the cutting-edge paradigm in TCM research, while Alzheimer's disease remains a prominent focus among neurodegenerative conditions due to its evolving etiology. A burst detection analysis unveils that in 2024, the focal points of research convergence between TCM and neurodegenerative diseases lie in two key biological processes or mechanisms: autophagy and microbiota. For the first time, this study quantitatively and visually captures the evolution of TCM in addressing neurodegenerative diseases, showcasing a notable acceleration in recent years. Our findings underscore the pivotal role of interdisciplinary collaboration and the necessity for increased global partnerships. Network pharmacology, leveraging the advancements of the big data era, embraces a holistic and systematic approach as a novel paradigm in exploring traditional Chinese medicine and unraveling their fundamental mechanisms. Three ethnomedical plants-Tianma, Renshen, and Wuweizi-demonstrate the promise of their bioactive compounds in treating neurodegenerative disorders, bolstered by their extensive historical usage for such ailments.

The potential of utilizing neutrophil chemotaxis to assess immune function, disease severity, and patient prognosis in sepsis remains underexplored. This study employed an innovative approach by integrating a multi-tip pipette with a Six-Unit microfluidic chip (SU6-chip) to establish gradients in six microchannels, thereby analyzing neutrophil chemotaxis in sepsis patients. We compared chemotactic parameters between healthy controls (NH = 20) and sepsis patients (NS1 = 25), observing significant differences in gradient perception time (GP), migration distance (MD), peak velocity (Vmax), chemotactic index (CI), reverse migration rate (RM), and stop migration number (SM). A novel composite indicator, the Sepsis Neutrophil Migration Evaluation (SNME) index, was developed by integrating these six chemotactic migration parameters. The SNME index and individual chemotaxis parameters showed significant correlations with the Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) score, hypersensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), and heparin-binding protein (HBP). Moreover, the SNME index demonstrated potential for monitoring sepsis progression, with ROC analysis confirming its predictive accuracy (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.895, cutoff value = 31.5, specificity = 86.73 %, sensitivity = 86.71 %), outperforming individual neutrophil chemotactic parameters.

Common methylation patterns across tumor types allow multi-cancer detection. Droplet digital PCR (ddPCR) has gained considerable attention for methylation detection. However, multi-cancer detection using multiple targets in ddPCR has never been performed before. Therefore, we developed a multiplex ddPCR assay for multi-cancer detection. Based on previous data analyses using The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), we selected differentially methylated targets for eight frequent tumor types (lung, breast, colorectal, prostate, pancreatic, head and neck, liver, and esophageal cancer). Three targets were validated using ddPCR in 103 tumor and 109 normal adjacent fresh frozen samples. Two distinct ddPCR assays were successfully developed. Output data from both assays is combined to obtain a read-out from the three targets together. Our overall ddPCR assay has a cross-validated area under the curve (cvAUC) of 0.948. Performance between distinct cancer types varies, with sensitivities ranging from 53.8% to 100% and specificities ranging from 80% to 100%. Compared to previously published single-target parameters, we show that combining targets can drastically increase sensitivity and specificity, while lowering DNA input. In conclusion, we are the first to report a multi-cancer methylation ddPCR assay, which allows for highly accurate tumor predictions.","2025","Molecular oncology"

Families are recommended to target an expression volume of at least 500-750 mL by Day 14 after birth, as this is considered a 'critical window' to establish milk supply. This is challenging for many mothers after a very preterm birth. This article explores the relationship of early milk quantity and later full breastmilk feeding as a 'gold standard' outcome, using statistical techniques designed for diagnostic tests. A cohort of 132 mothers of infants born at 23 + 0 to 31 + 6 weeks' gestational age submitted expressing logs on Day 4, 14 and 21 after birth and provided later feeding outcome. Using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, the following 24-h milk quantities were identified as associated with high probability of full breastmilk at 36 weeks' post-menstrual age (PMA): on Day 4, ≥250 g (specificity 88%; positive predictive value 88%) and on Day 21 ≥650 g (specificity 88%; positive predictive value 91%). The following values were identified as associated with low probability of full breastmilk at 36 weeks' PMA: on Day 4 <50 g (sensitivity 92%; negative predictive value 72%) and on Day 21 <250 g (sensitivity 90%; negative predictive value 70%). Participants exceeding the high thresholds had 3-4 times increased likelihood of full breastmilk, whereas those below the low thresholds had 3-5 times lower likelihood. These thresholds have potential as targets for families, to provide individualised prognostic information and to help clinicians target more intensive lactation support.","2025","Maternal & child nutrition"

This work aims to develop a novel contour quality classification (CQC) method by combining multiple quantitative metrics for clinical usability-oriented contour quality evaluation for deep learning-based auto-segmentation (DLAS). The CQC was designed to categorize contours on slices as acceptable, minor edit, or major edit based on the expected editing effort/time with supervised ensemble tree classification models using 7 quantitative metrics. Organ-specific models were trained for 5 abdominal organs (pancreas, duodenum, stomach, small, and large bowels) using 50 magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data sets. Twenty additional MRI and 9 computed tomography (CT) data sets were employed for testing. Interobserver variation (IOV) was assessed among 6 observers and consensus labels were established through majority vote for evaluation. The CQC was also compared with a threshold-based baseline approach. For the 5 organs, the average area under the curve was 0.982 ± 0.01 and 0.979 ± 0.01, the mean accuracy was 95.8% ± 1.7% and 94.3% ± 2.1%, and the mean risk rate was 0.8% ± 0.4% and 0.7% ± 0.5% for MRI and CT testing data set, respectively.

Sixteen studies comprising 4973 patients met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted to construct 2×2 contingency tables for sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV). A random-effects model was used for pooled estimation, and subgroup analyses were conducted. Summary receiver operating characteristic (SROC) curves were generated to summarize overall diagnostic performance. The overall detection rate of PCa across studies was 57.3%. For detecting any PCa, mpMRI showed pooled sensitivity of 82% (95% CI, 80-83%) and specificity of 62% (95% CI, 60-64%), with positive likelihood ratio (LR) of 1.97 (95% CI, 1.71-2.26), negative LR of 0.28 (95% CI, 0.24-0.34), and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 7.34 (95% CI, 5.60-9.63), and an area under the SROC curve of 0.81.

1584,"39222827","Early three-dimensional growth in uncomplicated type B aortic dissection is associated with long-term outcomes.","Late adverse events (LAEs) are common among initially uncomplicated type B aortic dissection (uTBAD); however, identifying those patients at highest risk of LAEs remains a significant challenge. Early false lumen (FL) growth has been suggested to increase risk, but confident determination of growth is often hampered by error in two-dimensional clinical measurements. Semi-automated three-dimensional (3D) mapping of aortic growth, such as by vascular deformation mapping (VDM), can potentially overcome this limitation using computed tomography angiograms (CTA). We hypothesized that FL growth in the early pre-dissection phase by VDM can accurately predict LAEs. We performed a two-center retrospective study of patients with uTBAD, with paired CTAs in the acute (1-14 days) and subacute/early chronic (1-6 months) periods. VDM analysis was used to map 3D growth. Standard clinical CT measures (ie, aortic diameters, tear characteristics) were also collected. Multivariate analysis was conducted using a decision tree and Cox proportional hazards model. LAEs were defined as aneurysmal FL (>55 mm); rapid growth (>5 mm within 6 months); aorta-specific mortality, rupture, or re-dissection. A total of 107 (69% male) patients with uTBAD initially met inclusion criteria with a median follow-up of 7.3 years (interquartile range [IQR], 4.7-9.9 years). LAEs occurred in 72 patients (67%) at 2.5 years (IQR, 0.7-4.8 years) after the initial event. A multivariate decision tree model identified VDM growth (>2.1 mm) and baseline diameter (>42.7 mm) as optimal predictors of LAEs (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.94), achieving an 87% accuracy (sensitivity of 93%, specificity of 76%) after leave-one-out validation. Guideline reported high-risk features were not significantly different between groups. Early growth of the FL in uTBAD was the best tested indicator for LAEs and improves upon the current gold-standard of baseline diameter in selecting patients for early prophylactic thoracic endovascular aortic repair.","2025","Journal of vascular surgery"

The proposed method was compared with nine baseline methods on a dataset of 113 subjects and showed superior performance (for segmentation, Dice similarity coefficient: 0.620, area under precision-recall curve [PR-AUC]: 0.660, 95% Hausdorff Distance: 0.848 mm, Average Symmetric Surface Distance: 0.692 mm; for slice-wise detection, F1 score: 0.823, recall: 0.764, precision: 0.892, PR-AUC: 0.853). For clinical needs, statistical tests confirmed agreement between the true calcification volumes and predicted values using the proposed approach. Various MR sequences, namely T1, time-of-flight, and SNAP, were assessed as inputs to the model, and SNAP provided unique and essential information pertaining to calcification structures. The proposed deep learning model with a dissimilarity loss to reduce feature complexity effectively improves MRI-based identification of intracranial arterial calcification. It could help establish a more comprehensive and powerful pipeline for vascular image analysis on MRI.","2025","Magnetic resonance in medicine"

Stool tests may help to reduce surveillance colonoscopies by limiting colonoscopies to individuals at increased risk of advanced neoplasia. This cross-sectional observational study included individuals aged 50-75 years with surveillance indication. Before bowel preparation, participants collected samples for a multitarget stool DNA test and 2 fecal immunochemical tests (FITs). Test accuracy was calculated for all surveillance indications. For the post-polypectomy indication only, which is the most common and is associated with a relatively low CRC risk, long-term impact of stool-based surveillance was evaluated with the Adenoma and Serrated Pathway to Colorectal Cancer (ASCCA) model. Stool-based strategies were simulated to tune each test's positivity threshold to obtain strategies at least as effective as colonoscopy surveillance. There were 3453 individuals with results for all stool tests and colonoscopy; 2226 had previous polypectomy, 1003 had previous CRC, and 224 had a familial risk. Areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve for advanced neoplasia were 0.72 (95% CI, 0.69-0.75) for the multitarget stool DNA test, 0.61 (95% CI, 0.58-0.64) for the FIT OC-SENSOR (Eiken Chemical Co, Tokyo, Japan) and 0.59 (95% CI, 0.56-0.61) for the FIT FOB-Gold (Sentinel, Milan, Italy). Stool-based post-polypectomy surveillance strategies at least as effective as colonoscopy surveillance reduced the number of colonoscopies by 15%-41% and required 5.6-9.5 stool tests over a person's lifetime. Multitarget stool DNA-based surveillance was more costly than colonoscopy surveillance, whereas FIT-based surveillance saved costs. This study found that stool-based post-polypectomy surveillance strategies can be safe and cost-effective, with potential to reduce the number of colonoscopies by up to 41%. gov, Number: NCT02715141.","2025","Gastroenterology"
1589,"39217081","Texture Feature Differentiation of Glioblastoma and Solitary Brain Metastases Based on Tumor and Tumor-brain Interface.","Texture features, derived from both the entire tumor area and the region of the tumor-to-brain interface, are crucial indicators for distinguishing tumor types and their degrees of malignancy. However, the discriminative value of texture features from both regions for identifying glioblastomas and metastatic tumors has not been thoroughly explored. The aim of this study is to develop and validate a diagnostic model that combines texture features from the entire tumor area and a 10 mm tumor-to-brain interface region, in an attempt to identify more stable and effective texture features. We retrospectively collected enhanced T1-weighted imaging data from 97 patients with glioblastoma (GBM) and 90 patients with single brain metastasis (SBM) between 2010 and 2024. Machine learning is used to establish multiple diagnostic models for discriminating GBM and SBM based on texture features of the entire tumor and 10 mm tumor-to-brain interface regions. Results underwent evaluation through 5-fold cross-validation analysis, calculating the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for each model. The performance of each model was compared using the Delong test, and the interpretability of the optimized model was further augmented by employing Shapley additive explanations (SHAP). The AUCs for all pipelines in the validation dataset were compared using FeAture Explorer (FAE) software. Among the models established by Kruskal-Wallis(KW) and Logistic Regression(LR), the AUC was highest using the ""one-standard error"" rule. '10mm_glrlm_GrayLevelNonUniformity' was considered the most stable and predictive feature. The best models in the training set, test set, and validation set were not the same. In the test set, the KW1LR model had the highest AUC of 0.880 and an accuracy of 0.824. The texture feature model that combines the overall tumor and the tumor-brain interface is beneficial for distinguishing glioblastoma from solitary metastatic tumors, and the texture features of the tumor interface exhibit higher heterogeneity.","2025","Academic radiology"

This study evaluates the MAGLUMI® SARS-CoV-2 Ag N protein chemiluminescent immunoassay (MAG-CLIA) for its analytical performance and its role in predicting disease severity and prognosis among severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. Analytical validation of plasma MAG-CLIA SARS-CoV-2 Ag N protein encompassed precision, interference, LoQ and linearity. Plasma N protein concentrations and other biomarkers were measured within 48 h of admission, tracked until discharge or death. The Mann-Whitney U test explored the association between plasma N protein and COVID-19 severity or prognosis. Longitudinal monitoring of plasma N protein dynamics was conducted in representative patients. MAG-CLIA demonstrated precise quantification of plasma N protein with a CV below 10 % and minimal interference. The LoQ was 0.88 ng/L, with a broad linear range. Plasma N protein showed high diagnostic accuracy for COVID-19, achieving 95.42 % specificity and 78.32 % sensitivity at 2.388 ng/L. Plasma N protein emerged as a valuable prognostic indicator, correlating with mechanical ventilation need and patient survival. Plasma N protein concentrations ≥ 424.3 ng/L (AUC 0.8102, sensitivity 78.38 %, specificity 85.48 %) were associated with poor prognosis in severe COVID-19 patients with comorbidities. MAG-CLIA's SARS-CoV-2 N protein detection in plasma demonstrates both analytical reliability and clinical relevance in our inaugural evaluation.

This study examined the predictive value of PENK for renal outcomes and mortality in patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS). Proenkephalin was measured in plasma in a prospective multicentre ACS cohort from Switzerland (n = 4787) and in validation cohorts from the UK (n = 1141), Czechia (n = 927), and Germany (n = 220). A biomarker-enhanced risk score (KID-ACS score) for simultaneous prediction of in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI) and 30-day mortality was derived and externally validated. On multivariable adjustment for established risk factors, circulating PENK remained associated with in-hospital AKI [per log2 increase: adjusted odds ratio 1.53, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.13-2.09, P = .007] and 30-day mortality (adjusted hazard ratio 2.73, 95% CI 1.85-4.02, P < .001). The KID-ACS score integrates PENK and showed an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of .72 (95% CI .68-.76) for in-hospital AKI and .91 (95% CI .87-.95) for 30-day mortality in the derivation cohort. Upon external validation, KID-ACS achieved similarly high performance for in-hospital AKI (Zurich: AUC .73, 95% CI .70-.77; Czechia: AUC .75, 95% CI .68-.81; Germany: AUC .71, 95% CI .55-.87) and 30-day mortality (UK: AUC .87, 95% CI .83-.91; Czechia: AUC .91, 95% CI .87-.94; Germany: AUC .96, 95% CI .92-1.00), outperforming the contrast-associated AKI score and the Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events 2.0 score, respectively. Circulating PENK offers incremental value for predicting in-hospital AKI and mortality in ACS.

Both pretreatment-enhanced computer technology images and whole slide images of pathological hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections were available for each patient. The image features were extracted and used to construct an ensemble radiopathomics machine learning model. In addition, a nomogram was developed by combining the imaging features and clinical characteristics. In total, 962 radiomics and 999 pathomics signatures were extracted from 106 patients in the training cohort. A fusion radiopathomics model was constructed using 13 radiomics and 5 pathomics signatures. The fusion model showed favorable performance compared to single-omics models, with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.789 in the validation cohort. Moreover, a combined radiopathomics nomogram (RPN) was developed based on radiopathomics features and the Borrmann type, which is a classification method for advanced GC according to tumor growth pattern and gross morphology. The RPN showed superior predictive performance in the training (AUC 0.880) and validation cohorts (AUC 0.797). The decision curve analysis showed that RPN could provide favorable clinical benefits to patients with GC. RPN was able to predict the pathological response to preoperative chemotherapy with high accuracy, and therefore provides a novel tool for personalized treatment of GC.","2025","Academic radiology"

We aimed to develop a visualization tool to aid patients with infertility in their decision-making for myomectomy. We included 191 women with uterine myoma attending an outpatient infertility clinic, of whom 124 patients underwent myomectomy. Of these, 65 (52.4%) patients became pregnant within 17.6 months after surgery, and 54 (83.1%) of them had a live birth. A logistic regression model predicting the pregnancy rate (area under the curve, 0.82; 95% confidence interval, 0.74-0.89; validation value, 74.6%) was generated using the leave-one-out cross-validation method. This model incorporated five factors: age, maximum level of infertility intervention following myomectomy, presence of submucosal myoma, maximum diameter of the myoma, and type of myomas (multiple or single). We successfully visualized the degree of involvement of each factor in the pregnancy rate by developing a nomogram based on this model. We expanded the data from the preoperative magnetic resonance images and applied machine learning using a convolutional neural network. The classification accuracy was 71.4% for sensitivity and 77.7% for specificity. Heatmap images, generated using gradient-weighted class activation mapping to show the classification results of this model, could distinguish between myomas that required enucleation and those that did not.

This study included three datasets comprising consecutive patients with untreated AVMs between January 2008 to December 2023. Training and test datasets were used to train and evaluate the model. An independent validation dataset of patients receiving conservative treatment was used to evaluate the model performance in predicting subsequent hemorrhage during follow-up. Hemodynamic and morphological features were quantitatively extracted based on digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Individual models using various machine learning algorithms and an ensemble model were constructed on the training dataset. Model performance was assessed using the confusion matrix-related metrics. This study included 844 patients with AVMs, distributed across the training (n=597), test (n=149), and validation (n=98) datasets. Five hemodynamic and 14 morphological features were quantitatively extracted for each patient. The ensemble model, constructed based on five individual machine-learning models, achieved an area under the curve of 0.880 (0.824-0.937) on the test dataset and 0.864 (0.769-0.959) on the independent validation dataset.

Traditionally, herbal preparations of Eryngium bungei Boiss. (E. b), Tragopogon buphthalmoides (DC.) Boiss. (T. b), Salvia hydrangea DC. ex Benth. (S. h), and Juniperus polycarpos K. Koch. (J. p) are used to manage diabetes in Iran. However, there is no evidence of their effectiveness in controlling glucose levels and their mechanisms remain unclear. This study aimed to investigate whether traditional doses of plant infusions can have hypoglycemic and/or anti-hyperglycemic effects during fasting and/or postprandial states and establish the basis for future research on their potential mechanisms of action. The effects of traditional doses of herbal extracts on blood glucose levels in STZ-NA-induced hyperglycemic rats were investigated in 2-h acute tests during fasting and postprandial states (with a glucose load). In addition, the potential inhibitory effect in vitro of enzymes involved in relevant pathways, such as gluconeogenesis (fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, FBPase and glucose-6-phosphatase, G6Pase), carbohydrate breakdown (intestinal α-glucosidases), and insulin sensitivity (protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B, PTP-1B) was evaluated. Acute toxicity tests were carried out and HPLC-SQ-TOF was used to analyze the chemical profiles of the plant extracts. In the fasting state, T. b, S. h, and E. b were as effective as glibenclamide in lowering blood glucose levels in hyperglycemic rats. Moreover, all three suppressed G6Pase and FBPase enzymatic activity by 90-97% and 80-91%, respectively. On the other hand, significant postprandial hypoglycemic efficacy was observed for E. b, S. h, and T. b. Based on the AUC values, T. b caused a reduction comparable to the therapeutic efficacy of repaglinide. When investigating the possible mechanisms of action involved in this activity, E. b, S. h, and T. b showed significant inhibition of PTP-1B in vitro (>70%). Finally, all plant extracts showed no signs of acute toxicity. Several compounds that may contribute to biological activities were identified, including phenolic acids and flavonoid glycosides. The present study supports the traditional use of T. b, E. b and S. h for the control of diabetes in the fasting and postprandial state. Moreover, these plants were found to be rich in bioactive compounds with hypoglycemic and antihyperglycemic activities. On the other hand, J. p, showed a modest effect only in the fasting state and after 90 min.

Subsequently, basic and multiple analytical features were engineered based on the air conduction thresholds of pure-tone audiometry. Later, 5 classical machine learning models were trained to diagnose MD using the engineered features. The models demonstrating excellent performance were also selected to predict EH. The model's effectiveness in MD diagnosis was compared with experienced otolaryngologists. First, the winning light gradient boosting (LGB) machine learning model trained by multiple features demonstrates a remarkable performance on the diagnosis of MD, achieving an accuracy rate of 87%, sensitivity of 83%, specificity of 90%, and a robust area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.95, which compares favorably with experienced clinicians. Second, the LGB model, with an accuracy of 78% on EH prediction, outperformed the other 3 machine learning models. Finally, a feature importance analysis reveals a pivotal role of the specific pure-tone audiometry features that are essential for both MD diagnosis and EH prediction. Highlighted features include standard deviation and mean of the whole-frequency hearing, the peak of the audiogram, and hearing at low frequencies, notably at 250 Hz.

Although their biological research has been intensive, there are only rare studies assessing the possible prognostic role of mutational signatures. We used data from The Cancer Genome Atlas to study the associations between the activity of the mutational signatures and four survival endpoints in 18 types of malignancies. We further explored the prognostic differences according to, for example, the HPV status in head and neck squamous cell carcinomas and smoking status in lung cancers. The predictive power of the signatures over time was evaluated with a dynamic area under the curve model, and the links between mutational signature activities and differences in gene expression patterns were analyzed. In 12 of 18 studied cancer types, we identified at least one mutational signature whose activity predicted survival outcomes after adjusting for the established prognostic factors. For example, overall survival was associated with the activity of mutational signatures in nine cancer types and disease-specific survival in seven cancer types. The clock-like signatures SBS5 and SBS40 were most commonly associated with survival endpoints. The genes of the myosin binding protein and melanoma antigen families were among the most substantially dysregulated genes between the signatures of low and high activity. The differences in gene expression also revealed various enriched pathways. Based on these data, specific mutational signatures associate with the gene expression and have the potential to serve as strong prognostic factors in several cancer types.","2025","International journal of cancer"

Machine learning models for all feature combinations achieved AUCs between 0.63-0.84 for stable PRISm vs. stable control, and 0.65-0.92 for stable PRISm vs. stable COPD classification. Models incorporating imaging features outperformed those trained solely on base features (p < 0.05). Compared to stable control and COPD, those with stable PRISm exhibited decreased %TLCCT and increased %GG+Reticulationtexture and GLDZMZDV.

The Kaplan-Meier survival curves showed that patients in the high-risk group had significantly poorer overall survival than patients in the low-risk group (P < 0.05). The US-based DLRN model could hold promise as clinical guidance for predicting the status of tumors and LNM after NAC in patients with breast cancer. This fusion model can also predict the prognosis of patients, which could help clinicians make better clinical decisions.","2025","Academic radiology"

High complication rates have been described in correlation with the treatment of PHF. Major risk factors for the outcome might be frailty, mobility and comorbidities of patients at the time of hospital admission. The aim of this study was to create risk adjusted quality indicators for surgical treatment of proximal humerus fractures based on German claims data and to evaluate the impact of the Hospital Frailty Risk Score (HFRS) on risk adjustment. Retrospective claims data (2015-2021) were used to create risk adjusted quality indicators for eight outcomes by clustered multivariable logistic regression. The comparison of different risk adjustment model performances was done by ROC-AUC and Standardized Mortality/Morbidity Ratios. In total, N = 34,912 patients (median age 75 years, 80.3 % female) were included. The most common surgical procedure was open reduction and internal fixation with plate osteosynthesis with 39.7 %, followed by reverse shoulder arthroplasty with 25.3 %. The most influential risk factor for all outcomes was a high HFRS with an Odds Ratio of 2.0 (95 %-Confidence Interval 1.8-2.3) for any secondary surgery (365 days) up to an Odds Ratio of 17.6 (95 %-Confidence Interval 14.9-20.8) for general complications during the index stay. Comparative quality reporting for the surgical treatment of PHF appears feasible with the developed models for risk adjustment using claims data. Preoperative evaluation of HFRS in PHF can contribute to risk assessment, and individual patient management. It therefore enables personalized treatment decisions.","2025","Archives of gerontology and geriatrics"

This study aimed to investigate the preoperative risk prediction and prognostic value of different radiomics models and a nomogram for proliferative HCC. Patients were randomly divided into a training cohort (n = 156) and a validation cohort (n = 66) in a 7:3 ratio. Original and delta (the different value between imaging features extracted from two different phases) radiomics features were extracted from T1-weighted imaging (T1WI), arterial, and hepatobiliary phases to construct models using different machine learning algorithms. Logistic regression was used to select clinical independent risk factors. A nomogram was constructed by integrating the optimal radiomics model score with independent risk factors. The diagnostic efficacy and clinical utility of the models were assessed. Subsequently, patients were stratified into high-risk and low-risk subgroups based on radiomics model scores and nomogram scores, and both recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) were evaluated. Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that BCLC stage and combined radscore were independent predictors of proliferative HCC. The area under the curve (AUC) of the nomogram incorporating these factors was 0.838 and 0.801 in the training and validation cohorts, respectively, with good predictive performance. Multivariate Cox regression analysis shows that the delta radiomics model (DR)-predicted proliferative HCC can independently predict RFS and OS, with scores from the delta radiomics model performing best in prognostic risk stratification. The nomogram can effectively predict proliferative HCC, while different radiomics models and the nomogram can offer varying prognostic stratification values.","2025","Academic radiology"

The objective of this study was to investigate the association of thoracic sarcopenia with survival outcomes among patients who underwent immunotherapy for NSCLC. In this retrospective study, patients who initiated immunotherapy for advanced NSCLC from 2019 to 2022 were enrolled. and detailed patient data were collected. Cross sectional skeletal muscle area was calculated at the fifth thoracic vertebra (T5) on pretreatment chest computed tomography (CT) scan. Gender-specific lowest quartile values was used to define sarcopenia. The risk factors were analyzed using Cox analyses. The log-rank test and the random survival forest (RSF) were used to compare progression free survival (PFS). The model's performance was assessed using calibration curve and the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC). A total of 242 patients was included (discovery cohort n = 194, validation cohort n = 48). In the discovery cohort, patients with sarcopenia exhibited significantly poorer PFS (p < 0.001) than patients without sarcopenia. Univariate cox regression revealed that sarcopenia, lung cancer stage, body mass index, smoking status, and neutrophil-to-lymphocyte ratio were predictors of poor PFS. A RSF model was constructed based on the aforementioned parameters, to evaluate the model's efficacy, the ROC curve was utilized. with an area under the curve for predicting 6-month PFS of 0.68 and for 12-month PFS of 0.69.

The aim of this study was to evaluate long-term outcomes after switching from IV-IFX to SC-IFX, including the drug concentration thresholds for maintaining remission and other predictors for loss of response after the switch. This multicenter observational study involved CD and UC patients who were in clinical remission for at least 24 weeks and were scheduled to switch from IV-IFX to SC-IFX. Two hundred and twenty patients were included (74 UC [34%] and 146 CD [66%]). IV-IFX was administered for 52.5 months (range 25-89). Before switch, 106 (49%) patients were receiving intensified IV-IFX. While SC-IFX levels significantly increased following the switch from IV-IFX to SC-IFX, clinical parameters, C-reactive protein, and fecal calprotectin remained unchanged during follow-up. SC-IFX levels were significantly higher in patients receiving the standard IV-IFX dose than in those receiving the intensified dose. Immunomodulatory therapy at baseline and perianal disease had no effect on IFX trough levels, whereas higher body mass index was associated with increased levels. The suggested optimal SC-IFX cutoff concentration for clinical and biochemical remissions based on receiver operating characteristic analysis was 12.2 μg/mL (area under the curve [AUC]: 0.62) at Week 12 and 13.2 μg/mL (AUC: 0.57) at Week 52. Drug persistence was 92% at Week 52, with a good safety profile. Switching from IV-IFX to SC-IFX safely maintains long-term remission in patients with CD and UC.

This retrospective analysis involved 202 BCa patients who underwent DECTU. DECTU-derived quantitative parameters were identified as risk factors through stepwise regression analysis to construct a DECT model. The radiomic features from the intratumoral and 3 mm outward peritumoral regions were extracted from the 120 kVp-like, 40 keV, 100 keV, and iodine-based material-decomposition (IMD) images in the venous-phase and were screened using Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman correlation analysis, and LASSO. Radiomics models were developed using the Multilayer Perceptron for the intratumoral, peritumoral and intra- and peritumoral (IntraPeri) regions. Subsequently, a nomogram was created by integrating the multi-image IntraPeri radiomics and DECT model. Model performance was evaluated using area-under-the-curve (AUC), accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity. Normalized iodine concentration (NIC) was identified as an independent predictor for the DECT model. The IntraPeri model demonstrated superior performance compared to the intratumoral and peritumoral models both in 40 keV (0.830 vs. 0.766 vs. 0.763) and IMD images (0.881 vs. 0.840 vs. 0.821) in the test cohort.

However, it can cause vomiting and recovery agitation. No studies have examined epigenetic factors, such as microRNAs, for predicting the occurrence of these adverse events. Neuronal-derived extracellular vesicle microRNA profiles were studied to predict the occurrence of ketamine-induced vomiting and recovery agitation in children. For this aim, a single-center prospective pharmacoepigenetic study was performed and 50 children who underwent procedural sedation with intravenous ketamine as the only sedative drug were enrolled between October 2019 and November 2022. MiRNA profiling in plasma neural-derived extracellular vesicles was analyzed through next-generation sequencing and measured before treatment with ketamine. Twenty-two patients experienced vomiting or recovery agitation. Among the 16 differentially expressed microRNAs, the upregulated miR-15a-5p and miR-484 targeted genes related to N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor activity, including glutamate ionotropic receptor NMDA type subunit 2A (GRIN2A). Preliminary data confirmed lower GRIN2A levels in patients who developed these events. Downregulated miR-126-3p and miR-24-3p targeted AMPA receptor-associated genes. Functional analyses of gene targets revealed the enrichment of glutamatergic and neurotrophins signaling. Recovery agitation was associated with this network. Vomiting was related to dopaminergic and cholinergic systems. Three miRNAs (miR-18a-3p, miR-484, and miR-548az-5p) were identified as predictive biomarkers (AUC 0.814; 95% CI: 0.632-0.956) for ketamine-induced vomiting and recovery agitation. MicroRNA profiles can predict the development of ketamine-induced vomiting or recovery agitation in children.

Thus, the purpose of this study was to develop an explainable AI model that can not only diagnose ACDs but also present the basis for the diagnosis. A dataset of 4942 slit-lamp images from 10 ophthalmological institutions across Japan were used as the image database. A sequential pipeline of segmentation AI was constructed to identify 12 clinical findings in 1038 images of seasonal and perennial allergic conjunctivitis (AC), atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC), vernal keratoconjunctivitis (VKC), giant papillary conjunctivitis (GPC), and normal subjects. The performance of the pipeline was evaluated by determining its ability to obtain explainable results through the extraction of the findings. Its diagnostic accuracy was determined for 4 severity-based diagnosis classification of AC, AKC/VKC, GPC, and normal. Segmentation AI pipeline efficiently extracted crucial ACD indicators including conjunctival hyperemia, giant papillae, and shield ulcer, and offered interpretable insights. The AI pipeline diagnosis had a high diagnostic accuracy of 86.2%, and that of the board-certified ophthalmologists was 60.0%.

A total of 205 patients with NSCLC underwent preoperative CT and were divided into two groups: DCB (progression-free survival (PFS) ≥ 18 months) and non-DCB (NDCB, PFS <18 months). The density percentiles of PD-L1 and CD8 + tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) were quantified to estimate the TIMT. Clinical characteristics and conventional CT signs were collected. Multivariate logistic regression was employed to select the most discriminating parameters, construct a predictive model, and visualize the model as a nomogram. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves, calibration curves, and decision curve analysis (DCA) were used to evaluate prediction performance and clinical utility. Precisely 118 patients with DCB and 87 with NDCB in NSCLC received postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy. TIMT was statistically different between the DCB and NDCB groups (P < 0.05). Clinical characteristics (neuron-specific enolase, squamous cell carcinoma antigen, Ki-76, and cM stage) and conventional CT signs (spiculation, bubble-like lucency, pleural retraction, maximum diameter, and CT value of the venous phase) varied between the four TIMT groups (P < 0.05). Furthermore, clinical characteristics (lymphocyte count [LYMPH] and cM stage) and conventional CT signs (bubble-like lucency and Pleural effusion) differed between the DCB and NDCB groups (P < 0.05). Multivariate analysis revealed that TIMT, cM stage, LYMPH, and pleural effusion were independently associated with DCB and were used to construct a nomogram. The area under the curve (AUC) of the combined model was 0.70 (95%CI: 0.64-0.76), with sensitivity and specificity of 0.73 and 0.60, respectively.

The study included 42 patients (42 eyes) scheduled for KPro surgery with a median follow-up period of 6 months. The receiver operating characteristic curve identified the cut-off threshold for CFF in the model development study (17 eyes). All patients in the comparison study (25 eyes) underwent preoperative assessments including trichromatic CFF (red, green and yellow), B-scan ultrasound, fVEP and perioperative endoscopy. Results were classified as either favourable or unfavourable predictors of visual outcomes based on predefined criteria. Sensitivity and specificity of each assessment were calculated based on postoperative best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA)≥20/200. The Bland-Altman test assessed the consistency between CFF-predicted BCVA and actual BCVA. Among the trichromatic CFF tests, the yellow-CFF (yCFF) exhibited the highest area under the curve value of 0.97 and a cut-off threshold at 10 Hz for predicting postoperative BCVA≥20/200 (p<0.05). yCFF achieved 90% sensitivity and 80% specificity in predicting satisfactory postoperative outcomes. Endoscopy had 80% sensitivity and 80% specificity, B-scan showed 70% sensitivity and 60% specificity, and fVEP had 75% sensitivity and 40% specificity. yCFF showed a mean bias of 0.091 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) in postoperative prediction. The CFF test provides robust visual function evaluation in KPro candidates. It demonstrates superior predictive accuracy for visual prognosis compared with routine ophthalmologic examinations, such as B-scan ultrasonography, fVEP and endoscopy.","2025","The British journal of ophthalmology"

Despite progress in genetic analyses, advancements in metabolomic analysis remain less established. Herein, the authors investigated metabolic activity differences between WHO grade 1 meningiomas and WHO grade 2 or 3 meningiomas by noninvasively using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), aiming to preoperatively estimate malignancy. They also reviewed the literature to elucidate this aspect of meningioma research. At Ryukyu University Hospital, the authors focused on 93 patients diagnosed with meningioma between 2011 and 2021. The inclusion criteria encompassed prior surgery, pathological diagnoses of meningioma, and preoperative 1H-MRS. Group I included 71 patients with WHO grade 1 meningioma and group II included 22 patients, comprising 19 and 3 with WHO grade 2 and 3 meningioma, respectively. The authors retrospectively conducted a comparative analysis of patient backgrounds and tumor metabolites. Group I and II did not differ significantly in terms of patient demographic characteristics (age and sex). Group II demonstrated a significantly lower extent of tumor resection (p < 0.01), higher MIB-1 labeling index (LI) (p < 0.05), higher incidence of prior irradiation (p < 0.001), and increased rate of tumor recurrence (p = 0.005) compared to group I. According to 1H-MRS, all metabolites, except lactate, displayed significantly higher median creatine (Cr) ratios in group II than group I: glutamine/Cr was 8.46, glutamate/Cr was 9.49, lipid/Cr was 11.36, and choline/Cr was 2.77. According to the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis, glutamine had the largest area under the curve of 0.765 among 10 metabolites, and the cutoff value for distinguishing between group I and II was 5.76. In cases pathologically graded as WHO grade 2 or 3 meningiomas, metabolic products such as glutamine, glutamate, lipids, and choline increased significantly. These changes were correlated with elevation of the MIB-1 LI. In group II, the mean MIB-1 LI was 8.58, significantly higher than in group I, suggesting a strong association with pathological malignancy. Therefore, 1H-MRS may help to noninvasively predict tumor metabolic activity and tumor recurrence. Furthermore, the authors concluded from the ROC analysis that glutamine may be a potential indicator of future growth of meningioma and benefits of early surgery.","2025","Journal of neurosurgery"

Elucidating the composition of ccRCC holds promise for the discovery of highly sensitive biomarkers. Our objective was to utilize habitat imaging techniques and integrate multimodal data to precisely predict the risk of metastasis, ultimately enabling early intervention and enhancing patient survival rates. A retrospective analysis was performed on a cohort of 263 patients with ccRCC from three hospitals between April 2013 and March 2021. Preoperative CT images, ultrasound images, and clinical data were comprehensively analyzed. Patients from two campuses of Qilu Hospital of Shandong University were assigned to the training dataset, while the third hospital served as the independent testing dataset. A robust consensus clustering method was used to classify the primary tumor space into distinct sub-regions (i.e., habitats) using contrast-enhanced CT images. Radiomic features were extracted from these tumor sub-regions and subsequently reduced to identify meaningful features for constructing a predictive model for ccRCC metastasis risk assessment. In addition, the potential value of radiomics in predicting ccRCC metastasis risk was explored by integrating ultrasound image features and clinical data to construct and compare alternative models. In this study, we performed k-means clustering within the tumor region to generate three distinct tumor subregions. We quantified the Hounsfiled Unit (HU) value, volume fraction, and distribution of high- and low-risk groups in each subregion. Our investigation focused on 252 patients with Habitat1 + Habitat3 to assess the discriminative power of these two subregions. We then developed a risk prediction model for ccRCC metastasis risk classification based on radiomic features extracted from CT and ultrasound images, and clinical data.

This study aimed to improve the prediction of late xerostomia by using 3-dimensional information from radiation dose distributions, computed tomography imaging, organ-at-risk segmentations, and clinical variables with deep learning (DL). An international cohort of 1208 patients with head and neck cancer from 2 institutes was used to train and twice validate DL models (deep convolutional neural network, EfficientNet-v2, and ResNet) with 3-dimensional dose distribution, computed tomography scan, organ-at-risk segmentations, baseline xerostomia score, sex, and age as input. The NTCP endpoint was moderate-to-severe xerostomia 12 months postradiation therapy. The DL models' prediction performance was compared with a reference model: a recently published xerostomia NTCP model that used baseline xerostomia score and mean salivary gland doses as input. Attention maps were created to visualize the focus regions of the DL predictions. Transfer learning was conducted to improve the DL model performance on the external validation set. All DL-based NTCP models showed better performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]test, 0.78-0.79) than the reference NTCP model (AUCtest, 0.74) in the independent test. Attention maps showed that the DL model focused on the major salivary glands, particularly the stem cell-rich region of the parotid glands. DL models obtained lower external validation performance (AUCexternal, 0.63) than the reference model (AUCexternal, 0.66). After transfer learning on a small external subset, the DL model (AUCtl, external, 0.66) performed better than the reference model (AUCtl, external, 0.64). DL-based NTCP models performed better than the reference model when validated in data from the same institute. Improved performance in the external data set was achieved with transfer learning, demonstrating the need for multicenter training data to realize generalizable DL-based NTCP models.","2025","International journal of radiation oncology, biology, physics"

In the consistent group, the diagnostic accuracy and area under the curve (AUC) of S-Detect were significantly higher than those of BI-RADS (accuracy: 91.2% vs. 84.9%, p = 0.045; AUC: 0.916 vs. 0.859, p = 0.036). In the inconsistent group, the diagnostic accuracy and AUC of S-Detect in radial and anti-radial planes were lower than those of BI-RADS (accuracy: 47.7% for radial, 52.2% for anti-radial vs. 69.3% for BI-RADS, p = 0.014, p-anti = 0.039; AUC: 0.503 for radial, 0.497 for anti-radial vs. 0.739 for BI-RADS, p = 0.042, p-anti <0.001). Diagnostic inconsistency in S-Detect across planes was significantly associated with lesion size, indistinct or angular margins, and enhancement posterior acoustic features (p < 0.05). S-Detect has outperformed BI-RADS in diagnostic precision under conditions of inter-planar concordance. However, its diagnostic efficacy is compromised in scenarios of inter-planar discordance. Under these circumstances, the results of S-Detect should be carefully referenced.","2025","Academic radiology"

However, these investigations often included CTMs scanned >30 minutes after intrathecal contrast injection, a longer delay than the myelographic techniques used in current practice. The purpose of this study was to determine whether renal contrast excretion (RCE) measured during this earlier time period (≤30 minutes) can discriminate patients with SIH from patients without SIH. A single-center, retrospective cohort of consecutive patients presenting for evaluation of possible SIH between July 2021 and May 2022 was studied. RCE was measured in both renal hila by using standardized (5-15 mm3) ROIs. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were constructed by comparing RCE between patients with SIH and patients without SIH in the overall cohort and within the subgroup of patients with negative myelograms. The study cohort included 190 subjects. Both unadjusted and adjusted models demonstrated a statistically significant increase in renal contrast attenuation among patients with SIH compared with those without SIH (P values ≤.001). The ROC curve showed moderate discrimination between these groups (area under the ROC curves [AUC] 0.76). However, by using clinically meaningful test criteria of sensitivity >90% or specificity >90%, the 2 corresponding threshold hounsfield units (HU) values resulted in low specificity of 31.3% and sensitivity of 50.8%. Subgroup analysis of patients with negative myelograms showed poorer performance in discriminating SIH+ from SIH- (AUC 0.62). In this subgroup, using similar test criteria of sensitivity >90% or specificity >90 resulted in low specificities and sensitivities, at 26.0% and 37.5%, respectively. We found a statistically significant positive association between RCE and SIH diagnosis during early-phase CTM; however, clinically useful thresholds based on cutoff values for renal HU resulted in poor sensitivities or specificities, with substantial false-positives or false-negatives, respectively. Thus, while we confirmed statistically significant differences in RCE in the ≤30-minute period, in keeping with prior investigations of more delayed time periods, overlap in renal attenuation values prevented the development of clinically useful threshold values for discriminating SIH+ from SIH- patients.","2025","AJNR.

New CD38-targeting agents have been shown to reduce anti-HLA antibodies, although with important interpatient variability. Thus, pretreatment identification of responder and nonresponder (NR) patients is needed for treatment decision-making. We analyzed 26 highly sensitized (HS) patients from 2 desensitization trials using anti-CD38 monoclonal antibodies. Hierarchical clustering identified 3 serologic responder groups: high responders, low responders, and NR. Spectral flow cytometry and functional HLA-specific memory B cell (mBC) assessment were first conducted on peripheral blood mononuclear cells and bone marrow samples from 16 patients treated with isatuximab (NCT04294459). Isatuximab effectively depleted bone marrow plasma cells, peripheral CD38-expressing plasmablasts, plasma cells, transitional B cells, and class-switch mBCs, ultimately reducing frequencies of HLA-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)-producing mBCs. Multidimensional spectral flow cytometry with partial least squares discriminant analysis revealed that pretreatment abundance of specific circulating mBC phenotypes, especially CD38neg class-switch mBCs, accurately distinguished between high serologic responders and low responders or NR (AUC 0.958, 0.860-1.000, P = .009), who also displayed significantly lower frequencies of HLA-specific IgG-producing mBCs (P < .0001). This phenotypical mBC signature predicting response to therapy was validated in an external HS patient cohort (n = 10) receiving daratumumab (NCT04204980). This study identifies critical circulating mBC subset phenotypes that distinguish HS patients with successful serologic responses to CD38-targeting desensitization therapies, potentially guiding treatment decision-making.","2025","American journal of transplantation : official journal of the American Society of Transplantation and the American Society of Transplant Surgeons"

Frailty, prevalent in the ageing population and linked to adverse outcomes, underscores the need to align treatment strategies with quality of life. Recognising frailty as a trigger for GOC discussions during rapid response calls (RRCs) is critical for efficient resource management and improving patient outcomes. This single-centre retrospective cohort study included all hospitalised patients aged ≥65 years admitted between September 2021 and June 2023 who experienced an RRC. Frailty was assessed using the Clinical Frailty Scale (CFS) during the RRC. The primary outcome was to investigate whether frailty, specifically assessed by the CFS as screened during an RRC, could be a suitable clinical trigger for initiating GOC discussions. We also aimed to identify the proportion of patients with frailty (CFS score: ≥5) and predictors at the time of RRC, resulting in recommendations for GOC discussions. Among 4954 patients, 1685 (34.0%) were classified as frail (CFS score: ≥5). Recommendations increased with frailty levels (nonfrail [CFS score: 1-4]: 6.6%, mildly frail [CFS score: 5]: 19.3%, moderate-to-severely frail [CFS score: 6-9]: 32.2%; p < 0.001). Frailty independently increased the probability of GOC recommendations during an RRC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve = 0.71). The CFS cut-off point for GOC recommendations was ≥5. The presence of frailty was associated with higher odds of receiving GOC recommendations for mildly frail (CFS score: 5; odds ratio [OR] = 2.53; 95% confidence interval: 1.96-3.27) and moderate-to-severely frail (CFS score: 6-9; OR = 4.69; 95% confidence interval: 3.81-5.78) compared to nonfrail patients. Frailty, identified during an RRC, served as a robust trigger for GOC recommendations, highlighting the importance of tailored proactive discussions before episodes of deterioration. Higher levels of frailty (CFS score: ≥5) demonstrate practical markers for aiding clinicians with proactive GOC discussions.","2025","Australian critical care : official journal of the Confederation of Australian Critical Care Nurses"

We collected 440 patients with IAs in our hospital from 2015 to 2023, totaling 475 IAs (214 ruptured and 261 unruptured). A 7:3 random split was utilized to allocate participants into training and testing sets. To optimize the selection of radiomics features extracted from digital subtraction angiography, we employed t-tests and LASSO regression. Subsequently, we built single-factor and multifactor logistic regression (LR) models, alongside a nomogram. Furthermore, we employed four ML algorithms. After a comprehensive evaluation, including area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, decision curve analysis (DCA), and other metrics, the best model was determined. The AUCs for LR models P (PHASES), M (Morphology), and R (Radscore) in the testing set were 0.859, 0.755, and 0.803, respectively, while those for multifactor models R+M (Radscore and Morphology), R+P (Radscore and PHASES), and R+M+P (Radscore, Morphology, and PHASES) were 0.818, 0.899, and 0.887, respectively. The AUCs of random forest, extreme gradient boosting, gradient boosting machine, and light gradient boosting machine were 0.880, 0.888, 0.891, and 0.892 in testing set, respectively. In the training set, the LR model showed significant differences in AUCs compared with the four ML models (all p < 0.05). However, in the testing set, no statistically significant differences were found between them (all p > 0.05). Both ML models and the nomogram exhibit excellent performance in DCA and calibration curves.

Radiomics features were extracted and screened from CT images. Independent radiomics, clinical, and combined models were constructed to predict PNI. Model discrimination, calibration, clinical utility, and prognostic significance were evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), calibration curves, decision curves analysis, and Kaplan-Meier curves, respectively. 15 radiomics features and three clinical factors were included in the final analysis. The AUCs of the radiomics model in the training, testing, and external validation sets were 0.843 (95% CI: 0.788-0.897), 0.831 (95% CI: 0.741-0.920), and 0.802 (95% CI: 0.722-0.882), respectively.

In this meta-analysis, we searched for urinary C-C motif chemokine ligand 14 (CCL14), Tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase-2&insulin-like growth factor-binding protein-7 (TIMP-2&IGFBP7), Neutrophil Gelatinase-Associated Lipocalin (NGAL), plasma Cystatin C (pCysC), Soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR), Proenkephalin (PenK) and urinary dickkopf-3:urinary creatinine (uDKK3:uCr) from various databases including Medline, PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane. This was geared towards predicting persistent AKI in adults (>18 years). Hierarchically summarized subject work characteristic curves (HSROC) and diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) values were used to summarize the diagnostic accuracy of the biomarkers. Further, meta-regression and subgroup analyses were carried out to identify sources of heterogeneity as well as evaluate the best predictive biomarkers in different populations and regions. We screened 31 studies from 2,356 studies and assessed the diagnostic value of 7 biomarkers for persistent AKI. Overall, CCL14 had the best diagnostic efficacy with an AUC of 0.79 (95 % CI 0.75-0.82), whereas TIMP-2 & IGFBP7, NGAL, and pCysC had diagnostic efficacy of 0.75 (95 % CI 0.71-0.79),0.71 (95 % CI 0.67-0.75), and 0.7007, respectively. Due to a limited number of studies, PenK, uDKK3:uCr, and suPAR were not subjected to meta-analysis; however, relevant literature reported diagnostic efficacy above 0.70. Subgroup analyses based on population, region, biomarker detection time, AKI onset time, and AKI duration revealed that in the intensive care unit (ICU) population, the AUC of CCL14 was 0.8070, the AUC of TIMP-2 & IGFBP7 was 0.726, the AUC of pCysC was 0.72, and the AUC of NGAL was 0.7344; in the sepsis population, the AUC of CCL14 was 0.85, the AUC of TIMP-2&IGFBP7 was 0.7438, and the AUC of NGAL was 0.544; in the post-operative population, the AUC of CCL14 was 0.83-0.93, the AUC of TIMP-2&IGFBP7 was 0.71, and the AUC of pCysC was 0.683. Regional differences were observed in biomarker prediction of persistent kidney injury, with AUCs of 0.8558 for CCL14, 0.7563 for TIMP-2 & IGFBP7, and 0.7116 for NGAL in the Eurasian American population. In the sub-African population, TIMP-2 & IGFBP7 had AUCs of 0.7945, 0.7418 for CCL14, 0.7097 for NGAL, and 0.7007 for pCysC. for TIMP-2 & IGFBP7 was 0.7945, AUC for CCL14 was 0.7418, AUC for NGAL was 0.7097, and AUC for pCysC was 0.7007 in the sub-African population. Duration of biomarker detection, AKI onset, and AKI did not influence the optimal predictive performance of CCL14. Subgroup analysis and meta-regression of CCL14-related studies revealed that CCL14 is the most appropriate biomarker for predicting persistent stage 2-3 AKI, with heterogeneity stemming from sample size and AKI staging. This meta-analysis discovered CCL14 as the best biomarker to predict persistent AKI, specifically persistent stage 2-3 AKI.","2025","Clinica chimica acta; international journal of clinical chemistry"

This cross-sectional study was conducted over 18 months (from August 1, 2020 to February 18, 2022) and included 1550 participants divided into non-metabolic syndrome (non-MetS) group (n = 628) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) group (n = 922) in three centers of China. Logistic regression analysis was employed to investigate the correlation between HOMA-IR, body fat percentage, BMI (body mass index), visceral fat index, waist-to-hip ratio, vitamin D, and CMRI. Further analysis was conducted to evaluate the ability of HOMA-IR in diagnosing high CMRI within different metabolic, gender, and age groups to predict the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD). HOMA-IR was significantly higher in the MetS group compared with the non-MetS group (P < 0.05). CMRI was significantly higher in the MetS group compared to the non-MetS group (P < 0.05). According to ROC curve analysis, HOMA-IR can predict cardiovascular risk (CVR) in the general population, non-MetS individuals, and MetS people. Logistic regression analysis revealed that BMI, visceral fat index, waist-to-hip ratio, and HOMA-IR are independent risk indicators of high CVR, whereas vitamin D may exert a protective role. HOMA-IR was an independent risk factor for increased CVR in MetS patients. Moreover, HOMA-IR elevates the risk of CVD regardless of MetS and thus can be used for screening the general population.

All patients underwent preoperative breast MRI consisting of fat-suppressed T2-weighted imaging, axial dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, and diffusion-weighted imaging sequences. From these sequences, radiomics features were derived. Three distinct models were established utilizing cMRI features, radiomics features, and a comprehensive model that amalgamated both. The predictive capabilities of these models were assessed using the receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The comparative performance was then determined through the DeLong test and net reclassification improvement (NRI). In a randomized split, the 287 patients with BC were allotted to either training (234; 46 HER2-zero, 107 HER2-low, 81 HER2-positive) or test (53; 8 HER2-zero, 27 HER2-low, 18 HER2-positive) at an 8:2 ratio.

Perfusion imaging has been shown to correlate well with tumor grade in adults, however there are fewer studies in pediatric patients. Moreover, there is no consensus regarding which MR perfusion technique demonstrates the highest accuracy in the latter population. We sought to compare the diagnostic test accuracy of DSC and arterial spin-labeling (ASL), in their ability to differentiate between low- and high-grade pediatric brain tumors at first presentation. Articles were retrieved from online electronic databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), Web of Science Core Collection, and Scopus. Studies in pediatric patients with a treatment-naïve diagnosed brain tumor and imaging including either ASL or DSC or both, together with a histologic diagnosis were included. Studies involving adult patient or mixed age populations, studies with incomplete data, and those that used dynamic contrast-enhanced perfusion were excluded. The sensitivities and specificities obtained from each study were used to calculate the true-positive, true-negative, false-positive, and false-negative count. A case was defined as a histologically proved high-grade tumor. The random-effect model was used to merge statistics. Significance level was set at P < .05. Forest plots showing pairs of sensitivity and specificity, with their 95% CIs, were constructed for each study. The bivariate model was applied to account for between-study variability. The summary receiver operating characteristics (SROC) plots were constructed from the obtained data sets. The area under the curve for the SROC of all studies was estimated to determine the overall diagnostic test accuracy of perfusion MRI, followed by a separate comparison of the SROC of ASL versus DSC studies. There was a small and heterogeneous sample size. The diagnostic accuracy of ASL was found to be comparable and not inferior to DSC, thus its use in the diagnostic assessment of pediatric patients should continue to be supported.","2025","AJNR.

In addition, we aim to develop a machine learning-based classification model to classify dysglycemia based on observed patterns. Methods: Data from five distinct studies, each featuring at least two days of CGM, were pooled. Participants included individuals classified as healthy, with prediabetes, or with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). Various CGM indices were extracted and compared across groups. The data set was split 70/30 for training and testing two classification models (XGBoost/Logistic Regression) to differentiate between prediabetes or dysglycemia and the healthy group. Results: The analysis included 836 participants (healthy: n = 282; prediabetes: n = 133; T2DM: n = 432). Across all CGM indices, a progressive shift was observed from the healthy group to those with diabetes (P < 0.001). Statistically significant differences (P < 0.01) were noted in mean glucose, time below range, time above 140 mg/dl, mobility, multiscale complexity index, and glycemic risk index when transitioning from health to prediabetes. The XGBoost models achieved the highest receiver operating characteristic area under the curve values on the test data set ranging from 0.91 [confidence interval (CI): 0.87-0.95] (prediabetes identification) to 0.97 [CI: 0.95-0.98] (dysglycemia identification). Conclusion: Our findings demonstrate a gradual deterioration of glucose homeostasis and increased glycemic variability across the spectrum from normo- to dysglycemia, as evidenced by CGM metrics. The performance of CGM-based indices in classifying healthy individuals and those with prediabetes and diabetes is promising.","2025","Diabetes technology & therapeutics"

One hundred forty-seven patients clinically diagnosed with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) were retrospectively investigated. Patients were divided into 2 groups according to the presence of CAD. Their clinical characteristics and lipid profiles were evaluated. There were no significant differences in untreated LDL-C levels between the 2 groups (p=0.4), whereas the cumulative exposure to LDL-C and Lp(a) concentration were significantly higher in patients with CAD (11956 vs. 8824 mg-year/dL, p＜0.01; 40 vs. 14 mg/dL, p＜0.001, respectively). A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis demonstrated that the cutoff values of Lp(a) and cumulative LDL-C exposure to predict CAD in patients with FH were 28 mg/dL (AUC 0.71) and 10600 mg-year/dL (AUC 0.77), respectively. A multivariate analysis revealed that cumulative LDL-C exposure ≥ 10600 mg-year/dL (p＜0.0001) and Lp(a) level ≥ 28 mg/dL (p＜0.001) were independent predictors of CAD. Notably, the risk of CAD remarkably increased to 85.7% with smoking, Lp(a) ≥ 28 mg/dL, and cumulative LDL-C exposure ≥ 10600 mg-year/dL (odds ratio: 46.5, 95%CI: 5.3-411.4, p＜0.001).

Individuals with FRDA had lower insulin sensitivity (whole-body insulin sensitivity index 2.8 vs 5.3, P < .01), higher postprandial insulin secretion (insulin secretory rate incremental area under the curve 30-180 minutes, 24 652 vs 17,858, P < .05), and more suppressed postprandial endogenous glucose production (-.9% vs 26.9% of fasting endogenous glucose production, P < .05). In regression analyses, lower OXPHOS and inactivity explained some of the difference in insulin sensitivity. More visceral fat contributed to lower insulin sensitivity independent of FRDA. Insulin secretion accounting for sensitivity (disposition index) was not different. Lower mitochondrial OXPHOS capacity, inactivity, and visceral adiposity contribute to lower insulin sensitivity in FRDA. Higher insulin secretion appears compensatory and, when inadequate, could herald DM. Further studies are needed to determine if muscle- or adipose-focused interventions could delay FRDA-related DM.","2025","The Journal of clinical endocrinology and metabolism"

Hence, it remains unclear whether targeting eosinophils should be further explored as a treatment option in inflammatory bowel disease. Acute and chronic dextran sulfate sodium colitis was induced in wild-type C57BL/6 mice. Eosinophils were depleted by anti-CCR3 injections before colitis induction in a chronic model and after colitis onset in an acute model in order to investigate the impact of eosinophil depletion on pre-existing colitis. Inflammation was assessed using the disease activity index, macroscopic damage, and histological disease activity score. In the chronic model, fibrosis was assessed by examining colon weight/length ratio, collagen deposition through Martius Scarlet Blue staining, hydroxyproline assay, and COL1A1 expression. Protein and gene expression were assessed using the Meso Scale Discovery platform and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. In the acute and chronic colitis model, eosinophil depletion resulted in reduced disease activity and faster recovery, as observed via the total area under the curve of the disease activity index (P = .004 and P = .02, respectively), macroscopic damage score (P = .009 and P = .08, respectively), and histological disease activity score (P = .09 and P = .002, respectively). In the acute model, the accelerated recovery was accompanied by an increase in interleukin (IL)-10 (P = .03) and a decrease in IL-4 (P = .03) and IL-6 (P = .009). Colon weight/length ratio and collagen deposition were not affected by eosinophil depletion. Eosinophil depletion prevents and decreases intestinal inflammation in a preclinical dextran sulfate sodium model without affecting fibrosis. These results pave the way for exploring eosinophil depletion as a novel treatment modality in addressing intestinal inflammation.","2025","Inflammatory bowel diseases"

We retrospectively recruited adults who underwent coronary computed tomography angiography (CTA). A total of 127 NAFLD patients and 127 non-NAFLD patients were included in this study. Clinical features and imaging parameters were analysed, mainly including pericardial adipose tissue (PAT), pericoronary adipose tissue (PCAT), and radiomic features of 6792 PCATs. The inflammatory associations of NAFLD patients with PAT and PCAT were analysed. Clinical features (model 1), CTA parameters (model 2), the radscore (model 3), and a composite model (model 4) were constructed to identify patients with NAFLD with stable CAD. The presence of NAFLD resulted in a greater inflammatory involvement in all three coronary arteries (all P < 0.01) and was associated with increased PAT volume (r = 0.178**, P < 0.05). In the presence of NAFLD, the mean CT value of the PAT was significantly correlated with the fat attenuation index (FAI) in all three vessels and had the strongest correlation with the RCA FAI (r = 0.55, p < 0.001). A total of 9 radiomic features were screened by LASSO regression to calculate radiomic scores. In the model comparison, model 4 had the best performance of all models (AUC 0.914 [0.863-0.965]) and the highest overall diagnostic value of the model (sensitivity: 0.814, specificity: 0.941). NAFLD correlates with PAT volume and PCAT inflammation. Furthermore, combining clinical features, CTA parameters, and radiomic scores can improve the efficiency of early diagnosis of stable CAD in patients with NAFLD.","2025","Nutrition, metabolism, and cardiovascular diseases : NMCD"

A large retrospective dataset (n = 2484) was collected from 84 centers, while a prospective dataset (n = 500) was obtained from 26 additional centers. Baseline NCCT scans and follow-up NCCT scans were conducted within 6 h and 48 h from symptom onset, respectively. HE was defined as a volume increase of more than 6 mL on the follow-up NCCT. The retrospective dataset was divided into a training set (n = 1876) and a validation set (n = 608) by patient inclusion time. A two-stage framework was trained to predict HE, and its performance was evaluated on both the validation and prospective sets. Receiver operating characteristics area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, and specificity were leveraged. Our two-stage framework achieved an AUC of 0.760 (95% CI 0.724-0.799) on the retrospective validation set and 0.806 (95% CI 0.750-0.859) on the prospective set, outperforming the commonly used BAT score, which had AUCs of 0.582 and 0.699, respectively.

Our objective was to develop a nomogram based on preoperative CT-radiomics features, serving as a non-invasive diagnostic tool for SPMNs. Patients with surgically resected SPMNs from two medical centers between January 2018 and December 2022 were retrospectively reviewed. Radiomics features were extracted and screened from preoperative CT images. Logistic regression was employed to establish clinical, radiomics, and hybrid models for differentiating thymic epithelial tumors (TETs) from cysts. The performance of these models was validated in both internal and external test sets by area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), while also comparing their diagnostic capability with human experts. The study enrolled a total of 363 patients (median age, 53 years [IQR:45-59 years]; 175 [48.2%] males) for model development and validation, including 136 TETs and 227 cysts. Lesions' enhancement status, shape, calcification, and rad-score were identified as independent factors for distinction. The hybrid model demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to other models and human experts, with an AUC of 0.95 (95% CI:0.92-0.98), 0.94 (95% CI:0.89-0.99), and 0.93 (95% CI:0.83-1.00) in the training set, internal test set, and external test set respectively.

The ability to leverage conventional MRI for this problem could have a meaningful clinical impact. The purpose of this study was to explore contrast-enhanced T2 FLAIR (T2FLAIRc) as a new imaging biomarker of RN and TP. This single-institution retrospective study included patients with treated brain metastases undergoing DSC-MRI between January 2021 and June 2023. Reference standard assessment was based on histopathology or serial follow-up, including the results of DSC-MRI for a minimum of 6 months from the first DSC-MRI. The index test was implemented as part of the institutional brain tumor MRI protocol and preceded the first DSC-MRI. T2FLAIRc and gadolinium-enhanced T1 (T1c) MPRAGE signal were normalized against normal brain parenchyma and expressed as a z score. The mean signal intensity of enhancing disease for the RN and TP groups was compared using an unpaired t test. Receiver operating characteristic curves and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) were derived by bootstrapping. The DeLong test was used to compare AUCs. Fifty-six participants (mean age, 62 [SD, 12.7] years; 39 women; 28 with RN, 28 with TP) were evaluated. The index MRI was performed, on average, 73 [SD, 34] days before the first DSC-MRI. Significantly higher z scores were found for RN using T2FLAIRc (8.3 versus 5.8, P < .001) and T1c (4.1 versus 3.5, P = .02). The AUC for T2FLAIRc (0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.92) was greater than that for T1c (0.70; 95% CI, 0.56-0.83) (P = .04). The AUC of DSC-derived relative CBV (0.82; 95% CI, 0.70-0.93) was not significantly different from that of T2FLAIRc (P = .9). A higher normalized T1c and T2FLAIRc signal intensity was found for RN. In a univariable test, the mean T2FLAIRc signal intensity of enhancing voxels showed good discrimination performance for distinguishing RN from TP. The results of this work demonstrate the potential of T2FLAIRc as an imaging biomarker in the work-up of RN in patients with brain metastases.","2025","AJNR. American journal of neuroradiology"

In this retrospective cohort, the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) database provided the data used for this study's analysis. To identify the prognostic variables, we conducted Cox regression analysis and constructed prognostic models using five machine learning algorithms to predict the 5-year survival. A validation method incorporating the area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristic curve was used to validate the accuracy and reliability of the machine learning models. We also investigated the role of multiple therapeutic options using the Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. The study population comprised 329 patients. Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that older age, unmarried status, chemotherapy, and the total number of tumors in patients were poor prognostic factors. Machine learning models revealed that the multilayer perceptron accurately predicted outcomes, followed by the random forest classifier, gradient boosting classifier, K-nearest neighbors, and logistic regression models. The factors that contributed the most were age, marital status, and the total number of tumors in the patients.

We retrospectively analyzed 65 patients with liver or pancreatic cancer who underwent both TBX and MRG simulations and planning process. We trained three-dimensional U-Net deep learning models to predict dose distributions and generated dose volume histograms (DVHs) for each system. We integrated predicted DVH metrics into a Bayesian network (BN) model incorporating clinical data. The MRG prediction model outperformed the TBX model, demonstrating statistically significant superiorities in predicting normalized dose to the planning target volume (PTV) and liver. We developed a final BN prediction model integrating the predictive DVH metrics with patient factors like age, PTV size, and tumor location. This BN model an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve index of 83.56%. The decision tree derived from the BN model showed that the tumor location (abutting vs. apart of PTV to hollow viscus organs) was the most important factor to determine TBX or MRG.

Our objective was to develop a nomogram to predict such risk. We included a total of 1226 patients with carotid stenosis who underwent stenting between June 2015 and December 2022 from three medical centers, divided into a development cohort of 883 patients and a validation cohort of 343 patients. The model used LASSO regression for feature optimization and multivariable logistic regression to develop the predictive model. Model accuracy was assessed via the receiver operating characteristic curve, with further evaluation of calibration and clinical utility through calibration curves and decision curve analysis (DCA). The model underwent internal validation using bootstrapping and external validation with the validation cohort. Older age (OR 1.07, p=0.005), higher degrees of carotid stenosis (OR 1.07, p=0.006), poor collateral circulation (OR 6.26, p<0.001), elevated preoperative triglyceride levels (OR 1.27, p=0.041) and neutrophil counts (OR 1.36, p<0.001) were identified as independent risk factors for HICH during hospitalization. The nomogram constructed based on these predictive factors demonstrated an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.817. The AUCs for internal and external validation were 0.809 and 0.783, respectively. Calibration curves indicated good model fit, and DCA confirmed substantial clinical net benefit in both cohorts. We developed and validated a nomogram to predict HICH in patients with carotid stenosis post-stenting, facilitating early identification and preventive intervention in high-risk individuals.","2025","Journal of neurointerventional surgery"

These patients were classified according to a 3-class diagnostic algorithm, using symptoms and ultrasound features. ""White"" patients underwent annual telephone follow-up for 2 years, ""Green"" patients underwent a clinical and ultrasound follow-up at 6, 12, and 24 months and ""Orange"" patients underwent surgery. We further developed a risk class system to stratify the malignancy risk. Two thousand two hundred sixty-eight women were included and target lesion was classified as benign in 2158 (95.1%), as other malignancies in 58 (2.6%) an as mesenchymal uterine malignancies in 52 (2.3%) patients. At multivariable analysis, age (odds ratio 1.05 [95% confidence interval 1.03-1.07]), tumor diameter >8 cm (odds ratio 5.92 [95% confidence interval 2.87-12.24]), irregular margins (odds ratio 2.34 [95% confidence interval 1.09-4.98]), color score=4 (odds ratio 2.73 [95% confidence interval 1.28-5.82]), were identified as independent risk factors for malignancies, whereas acoustic shadow resulted in an independent protective factor (odds ratio 0.39 [95% confidence interval 0.19-0.82[). The model, which included age as a continuous variable and lesion diameter as a dichotomized variable (cut-off 81 mm), provided the best area under the curve (0.87 [95% confidence interval 0.82-0.91]). A risk class system was developed, and patients were classified as low-risk (predictive model value <0.39%: 0/606 malignancies, risk 0%), intermediate risk (predictive model value 0.40%-2.2%: 9/1093 malignancies, risk 0.8%), high risk (predictive model value ≥2.3%: 43/566 malignancies, risk 7.6%).

A retrospective analysis was conducted on 115 patients who received intravesical Gem/Doce for high-risk NMIBC between January 2011 and December 2021. Data were computed as the median (interquartile range [IQR]) or mean (standard deviation [sd]). Cox regression analysis was performed to determine if neutrophilia, NLR, platelet counts, and PLR before instillation therapy were predictive of recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS). Predictive performance was estimated using Uno's C-statistic. The median (IQR) follow-up for the overall cohort was 23 (13-36) months. The mean (sd) values for NLR, PLR and platelet counts were 3.4 (2.3), 142.2 (85.5), and 225.2 (75.1) × 109/L, respectively. NLR was associated with RFS, with a hazard ratio of 1.32 (95% confidence interval CI 1.19-1.46). Concordance analysis showed that NLR had a good ability to predict RFS (C-index: 0.7, P < 0.01). The PLR and platelet count were not associated with RFS and did not predict recurrence. In terms of OS, none of these cellular inflammatory markers showed any prediction value. Pre-treatment NLR provides some predictive accuracy for RFS in high-risk BCG-naïve patients receiving Gem/Doce.

A retrospective cohort study was conducted on women with twin pregnancies. Historical data between 2019 and 2021 were analyzed, including maternal characteristics and mean artery pressure measurements were obtained at 11-13, 22-24, and 28-33 weeks of gestation. The outcome measures included pre-eclampsia with delivery <34 and ≥34 weeks of gestation. Models were developed using logistic regression, and predictive performance was evaluated using the area under the curve, detection rate at a given false-positive rate of 10%, and calibration plots. Internal validation was conducted via bootstrapping. A total of 943 twin pregnancies, including 36 (3.82%) women who experienced early-onset pre-eclampsia and 93 (9.86%) who developed late-onset pre-eclampsia, were included in this study. To forecast pre-eclampsia during the third trimester, the most accurate prediction for early-onset pre-eclampsia resulted from a combination of maternal factors and MAP measured during this trimester. The optimal predictive model for late-onset pre-eclampsia includes maternal factors and MAP data collected during the second and third trimesters. The areas under the curve were 0.937 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.894-0.981) and 0.887 (95% CI 0.852-0.921), respectively. The corresponding detection rates were 83.33% (95% CI 66.53%-93.04%) for early-onset pre-eclampsia and 68.82% (95% CI 58.26%-77.80%) for late-onset pre-eclampsia. Repeated measurements of MAP during pregnancy significantly improved the accuracy of late-onset pre-eclampsia prediction in twin pregnancies.

The Artificial Intelligence Prognostic Scoring System for MDS (AIPSS-MDS), based on classical clinical parameters, has outperformed the IPSS, revised version (IPSS-R). For the first time, we validated the IPSS-M and other molecular prognostic models and compared them with the established IPSS-R and AIPSS-MDS models using data from South American patients. Molecular and clinical data from 145 patients with MDS and 37 patients with MDS/myeloproliferative neoplasms were retrospectively analyzed. Prognostic power evaluation revealed that the IPSS-M (Harrell's concordance [C]-index: 0.75, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve [AUC]: 0.68) predicted overall survival better than the European MDS (EuroMDS; C-index: 0.72, AUC: 0.68) and Munich Leukemia Laboratory (MLL) (C-index: 0.70, AUC: 0.64) models. The IPSS-M prognostic discrimination was similar to that of the AIPSS-MDS model (C-index: 0.74, AUC: 0.66) and outperformed the IPSS-R model (C-index: 0.70, AUC: 0.61). Considering simplified low- and high-risk groups for clinical management, after restratifying from IPSS-R (57% and 32%, respectively, hazard ratio [HR]: 2.8; P=0.002) to IPSS-M, 12.6% of patients were upstaged, and 5% were downstaged (HR: 2.9; P=0.001). The AIPSS-MDS recategorized 51% of the low-risk cohort as high-risk, with no patients being downstaged (HR: 5.6; P<0.001), consistent with most patients requiring disease-modifying therapy. The IPSS-M and AIPSS-MDS models provide more accurate survival prognoses than the IPSS-R, EuroMDS, and MLL models.

The objective of this study was to investigate the frequency of RH across different treatment modalities and its impact on glycemic control. Methods: This cross-sectional real-world study included adults with T1D using continuous glucose monitoring and attending the outpatient clinic at Steno Diabetes Center Copenhagen. RH was defined as ≥1 sensor glucose value (SG) >10.0 mmol/L (180 mg/dL) starting within 2 h of an antecedent SG <3.9 mmol/L (70 mg/dL). The severity of the RH events was calculated as area under the curve (AUC) and separately for users of multiple daily injections (MDIs), unintegrated insulin pumps, sensor augmented pumps (SAPs), and automated insulin delivery (AID), respectively. Results: Across the four groups, SAP and AID users had the highest incidence of RH (2.06 ± 1.65 and 2.08 ± 1.49 events per week, respectively) and a similar percentage of hypoglycemic events leading to RH events (41.3 ± 22.8% and 39.6 ± 20.1%, respectively). The AID users with RH events were significantly shorter compared with MDI users (122 ± 72 vs. 185 ± 135 min; P < 0.0001). Overall, severity of RH was inversely associated with more advanced technology (P < 0.001) and inversely associated (P < 0.001) with time in target range (TIR). Conclusions: Groups with insulin suspension features experienced the highest frequency of RH; however, AID users tended to experience shorter and less severe RH events. The association between the severity of RH events and TIR suggests that RH should be assessed and used in the guidance of hypoglycemia management.","2025","Diabetes technology & therapeutics"

This was a prospective multicenter study conducted in 6 tertiary referral hospitals. Patients scheduled to undergo endoscopy for mucosal inflammation monitoring were asked to take photographs of their stool using smartphones within 1 week before the day of endoscopy. DLSUC was developed using 2,161 stool pictures from 306 patients and tested on 1,047 stool images from 126 patients. The UC endoscopic index of severity was used to define endoscopic activity. The performance of DLSUC in endoscopic activity prediction was compared with that of fecal calprotectin (Fcal). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) of DLSUC for predicting endoscopic activity was 0.801 (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.717-0.873), which was not statistically different from the AUC of Fcal (0.837 [95% CI, 0.767-0.899, DeLong P = 0.458]). When rectal-sparing cases (23/126, 18.2%) were excluded, the AUC of DLSUC increased to 0.849 (95% CI, 0.760-0.919). The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of DLSUC in predicting endoscopic activity were 0.746, 0.662, and 0.877 in all patients and 0.845, 0.745, and 0.958 in patients without rectal sparing, respectively. Active patients classified by DLSUC were more likely to experience disease relapse during a median 8-month follow-up (log-rank test, P = 0.002). DLSUC demonstrated a good discriminating power similar to that of Fcal in predicting endoscopic activity with improved accuracy in patients without rectal sparing.

Therefore, the present study investigated the relationship between serum lung cancer biomarkers and peripheral arterial stiffness in middle-aged Chinese adults. In total, 3878 middle-aged Chinese adults were enrolled in this study. Increased peripheral arterial stiffness was assessed using the brachial-ankle pulse wave velocity and ankle-brachial index. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine the independent effects of serum lung cancer biomarkers on the risk of increased peripheral arterial stiffness. A receiver operating characteristic curve analysis was used to assess the diagnostic ability of serum lung cancer biomarkers in distinguishing increased peripheral arterial stiffness. Serum levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), cytokeratin-19 fragment 21-1, and pro-gastrin-releasing peptide were higher in subjects with increased peripheral arterial stiffness than in those without (P＜0.05). After adjusting for other risk factors, serum CEA and NSE levels were found to be independently associated with increased peripheral arterial stiffness. The corresponding adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for increased peripheral arterial stiffness in CEA level quartiles were 1.00, 1.57, 2.15, and 6.13. The ORs for increased peripheral arterial stiffness in the quartiles of NSE levels were 1.00, 4.92, 6.65, and 8.01.

The information captured by commonly used perineal ultrasound parameters is limited and insufficient for a comprehensive assessment of stress urinary incontinence. Although bladder neck motion plays a major role in stress urinary incontinence, objective and visual methods to evaluate its impact on stress urinary incontinence remain lacking. To use a deep learning-based system to evaluate bladder neck motion using 2-dimensional transperineal ultrasound videos, exploring motion parameters for diagnosing and evaluating stress urinary incontinence. We hypothesized that bladder neck motion parameters are associated with stress urinary incontinence and are useful for stress urinary incontinence diagnosis and evaluation. This retrospective study including 217 women involved the following parameters: maximum and average speeds of bladder neck descent, β angle, urethral rotation angle, and duration of the Valsalva maneuver. The fitted curves were derived to visualize bladder neck motion trajectories. Comparative analyses were conducted to assess these parameters between stress urinary incontinence and control groups. Logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses were employed to evaluate the diagnostic performance of each motion parameter and their combinations for stress urinary incontinence. Overall, 173 women were enrolled in this study (82, stress urinary incontinence group; 91, control group). No significant differences were observed in the maximum and average speeds of bladder neck descent and in the speed variance of bladder neck descent. The maximum and average speed of the β and urethral rotation angles were faster in the stress urinary incontinence group than in the control group (151.2 vs 109.0 mm/s, P=.001; 6.0 vs 3.1 mm/s, P<.001; 105.5 vs 69.6 mm/s, P<.001; 10.1 vs 7.9 mm/s, P=.011, respectively). The speed variance of the β and urethral rotation angles were higher in the stress urinary incontinence group (844.8 vs 336.4, P<.001; 347.6 vs 131.1, P<.001, respectively). The combination of the average speed of the β angle, maximum speed of the urethral rotation angle, and duration of the Valsalva maneuver demonstrated a strong diagnostic performance (area under the curve, 0.87). When 0.481∗β anglea+0.013∗URAm+0.483∗Dval=7.405, the diagnostic sensitivity was 70% and specificity was 92%, highlighting the significant role of bladder neck motion in stress urinary incontinence, particularly changes in the speed of the β and urethral rotation angles. A system utilizing deep learning can describe the motion of the bladder neck in women with stress urinary incontinence during the Valsalva maneuver, making it possible to visualize and quantify bladder neck motion on transperineal ultrasound. The speeds of the β and urethral rotation angles and duration of the Valsalva maneuver were relatively reliable diagnostic parameters.","2025","American journal of obstetrics and gynecology"

The present study evaluated the ability of [18F]FDG PET/CT, including its visual and quantitative parameters, to differentiate between benign and malignant splenic lesions. Patients who underwent [18F]FDG PET/CT following the detection of splenic lesions on contrast-enhanced CT were retrospectively analysed. Visual parameters assessed on [18F]FDG PET/CT included whole spleen uptake intensity, lesion multiplicity, and lesion uptake, and quantitative parameters included maximum standardised uptake value (SUVmax), lesion-to-background ratio (LBR), metabolic tumour volume (MTV), total lesion glycolysis (TLG), and lesion size. Parameters differentiating between benign and malignant lesions were evaluated by Pearson's chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis. Splenic lesion uptake (p = 0.001) was the only visual parameter significantly distinguishing between benign and malignant lesions. ROC curve analysis demonstrated that SUVmax had the largest area under the ROC, 0.91 (p < 0.001), with an optimal cut-off > 5.3 having a sensitivity of 90.3% and a specificity of 80.6%. Subgroup analysis of malignant lesions showed that SUVmax (p = 0.013), LBR (p = 0.012), and TLG (p  = 0.034) were significantly higher in splenic lymphomas than in splenic metastases. Of the [18F]FDG PET/CT parameters investigated, SUVmax had the highest accuracy in diagnosing malignant splenic lesions and was significantly higher in splenic lymphomas than in splenic metastases. Visual determination of [18F]FDG uptake by splenic lesions may be an easily evaluated parameter. SUVmax and visual grade of [18F]FDG PET/CT help to differentiate spleen lesions. [18F]FDG PET/CT is useful for discriminating between benign and malignant spleen lesions. Many splenic lesions are difficult to diagnose on anatomical imaging, with histopathologic analyses are required. SUVmax of PET/CT provided the diagnostic ability to differentiate between benign and malignant splenic lesions. More than normal spleen uptake can be a convenient parameter to diagnose malignant spleen lesions.","2025","European radiology"

The external validation group comprised 1492 patients from 2019. Predictors were identified using the least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) and multivariable logistic regression and nomograms were constructed. Models' performance was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC), decision curve analysis (DCA) and calibration curves. The prenatal nomogram included multiple gestation, premature rupture of membranes (PROM), chorioamnionitis, prenatal glucocorticoids, hypertensive disorder complicating pregnancy (HDCP) and Apgar 1 min, with area under the curve (AUC) of 0.805, 0.816 and 0.799 in the training, internal validation and external validation group, respectively. Days of mechanical ventilation (MV), shock, patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation, intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) grade III-IV, septicemia, hypothermia and necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) stage II-III were identified as postpartum predictors. The AUCs were 0.791, 0.813 and 0.823 in the three groups, respectively. DCA and calibration curves showed good clinical utility and consistency. The two nomograms provide clinicians with precise and efficient tools for prediction of WMI. This study is a large-sample multicenter study, spanning 10 years.

Histologically confirmed VETC-MVI pattern categorizing HCC into VM-HCC+ (VETC+/MVI+, VETC-/MVI+, VETC+/MVI-) and VM-HCC- (VETC-/MVI-). The regions of intratumor and peritumor were segmented manually in the arterial, portal-venous and delayed phase (AP, PP, and DP, respectively) of DCE-MRI. Six radiomics models (intratumor and peritumor in AP, PP, and DP of DCE-MRI) and one clinical model were developed for assessing VM-HCC. Establishing intra-tumoral and peri-tumoral models through combining intratumor and peritumor features. The best-performing radiomics model and the clinical model were then integrated to create a Combined model. In institution 1, pathological VM-HCC+ were confirmed in 88 patients (training set: 61, validation set: 27). In internal testing, the Combined model had an AUC of 0.85 (95% CI: 0.76-0.93), which reached an AUC of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.66-0.85) in external validation. The model's predictions were associated with early recurrence and progression-free survival in HCC patients. The clinical-radiomics model offers a non-invasive approach to discern VM-HCC and predict HCC patients' prognosis preoperatively, which could offer clinicians valuable insights during the decision-making phase.","2025","Academic radiology"

Careggi Collateral Score (CCS) is an angiographic score that demonstrated to be superior to the widely suggested ASITN/SIR score. Multi-phase CT-Angiography (mCTA) could be alternatively adopted for collateral assessment. We investigated whether mCTA had an equivalent predictive performance for functional outcome compared to CCS. Consecutive AIS patients undergoing EVT for large vessel occlusion within 24 h from onset were analyzed. Receiver operating characteristic curves and multivariable logistic regression were investigated to evaluate the predictive performance of mCTA collateral score (range 0-5) and CCS (range 0-4) for good functional outcome (three-months modified Rankin Scale 0-2). We included 201 subjects (59.7% females, mean age 75), of whom 96 (47.7%) had good outcome at three-months. Both CCS (OR = 14.4, 95% CI = 6.3-33.8) and mCTA (OR = 23.8, 95% CI = 10.1-56.4) collateral scores were independent predictors of outcome. The AUC of CCS was 0.80 (95% CI 0.73-0.86) and the best cut-off was ≥ 3 (87% sensitivity, 71% specificity), while the AUC of mCTA collateral score was 0.84 (95% CI 0.78-0.90) with an optimal cut-off of ≥ 4 (85% sensitivity, 87% specificity). Patients with good mCTA collaterals experienced smaller (16.6 vs. 63.7 mL, p < 0.001) infarct lesion as compared to those with mCTA poor collaterals. mCTA discriminative ability for three-months 0-2 mRS was found to be comparable to CCS. mCTA appears a valid, non-invasive imaging modality for evaluating collaterals of AIS patients potentially eligible for EVT.","2025","Neurological sciences : official journal of the Italian Neurological Society and of the Italian Society of Clinical Neurophysiology"

A previously developed automatic TICI score (autoTICI), which quantifies the ratio of reperfused pixels after EVT, demonstrates good correlation with eTICI. To evaluate the autoTICI model in a large multicenter registry of patients with an ischemic stroke, investigate the association with visual eTICI, and compare prediction of functional outcome between autoTICI and eTICI. Patients in the MR CLEAN Registry with an internal carotid artery, M1, and M2 occlusion were selected if both anteroposterior and lateral views were present in pre- and post-EVT DSA scans. The autoTICI score was compared with eTICI in predicting favorable functional outcome (modified Rankin Scale score 0-2), using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC) with a multivariable logistic regression model including known prognostic characteristics. In total 421 of 3637 patients were included. AutoTICI was significantly associated with eTICI non-linearly (below 70% cOR=2.3 (95% CI 2.1 to 2.5), above 70% cOR=1.6 (95% CI 1.6 to 1.7) per 10% increment).

Automatic quantitative assessment of reperfusion after EVT is associated with eTICI, and prediction of functional outcome is similar to that with visual eTICI. Therefore, autoTICI could be used as an alternative or additional review for visual reperfusion assessment to facilitate reproducible and uniform reporting.","2025","Journal of neurointerventional surgery"

The training, validation, and test dataset were consisted of 218, 51, and 40 images with mesiodens and 203, 55, and 61 without mesiodens, respectively. Unclear panoramic radiographs for which the diagnosis could not be accurately determined and other modalities were required for the final diagnosis were retrospectively identified and employed as the training dataset. Four CNN models provided within software supporting the creation of neural network models for deep learning were modified and developed. The diagnostic performance of the CNNs was evaluated according to accuracy, precision, recall and F1 scores, receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves, and area under the ROC curve (AUC). In addition, we used SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to attempt to visualize the image features that were important in the classifications of the model that exhibited the best diagnostic performance. A binary_connect_mnist_LeNet model exhibited the best performance of the four deep learning models. Our results suggest that a simple lightweight model is able to detect mesiodens. It is worth referring to AI-based diagnosis before an additional radiological examination when diagnosis of mesiodens cannot be made on unclear images. However, further revaluation by the specialist would be also necessary for careful consideration because children are more radiosensitive than adults.","2025","Odontology"

This has not; however, been studied in pediatric patients with scoliosis and CP, a population that experiences a high incidence of complications after corrective spinal surgery. Pediatric CP patients who underwent spinal correction surgery were included in this study. Patient background, surgical variables, and perioperative complications occurring within 30 days after surgery were collected. Patients were divided into 4 groups based on their SAS: SAS 0 to 4, SAS 5 to 6, SAS 7 to 8, and SAS 9 to 10. The incidences of perioperative complications for each group were compared using a receiver operating characteristic analysis. The area under the curve (AUC) is reported. A total of 111 patients met the inclusion criteria. There were no death cases. There were 44 (39.6%) perioperative major complications in 37 (33.3%) patients that occurred within 30 days after spine surgery. The most frequent perioperative complications were pulmonary issues (13.5%). The incidence of perioperative major complication in each SAS group was as follows: SAS 0 to 4; 51.6%, SAS 5 to 6; 30.2%, SAS 7 to 8; 18.5%, SAS 9 to 10; 0/0.

Among these, 107 ASLs from 98 patients with breast cancer (36 multifocal, 42 multicentric, and 29 contralateral) were identified. Clinical, pathological, conventional MRI findings, and ultrafast sequence-derived parameters were collected. A prediction model that adds ultrafast sequence-derived parameters to clinical, pathological, and conventional MRI findings was developed and validated internally. Decision curve analysis and net reclassification index statistics were performed. A nomogram was constructed. The ultrafast model adding time to peak enhancement, time to enhancement, and maximum slope showed a significantly increased area under the receiver operating characteristic curve compared with the conventional model which includes age, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 expression of index cancer, size of index cancer, lesion type of index cancer, location of ASL, and size of ASL (0.92 vs. 0.82; p = 0.002). The decision curve analysis showed that the ultrafast model had a higher overall net benefit than the conventional model. The net reclassification index of ultrafast model was 23.3% (p = 0.001). A combination of ultrafast sequence-derived parameters with clinical, pathological, and conventional MRI findings can aid in the differentiation of ASL on preoperative breast MRI. Our prediction model and nomogram that was based on ultrafast sequence-derived parameters could help radiologists differentiate ASLs on preoperative breast MRI. Ultrafast MRI can diminish background parenchymal enhancement and possibly improve diagnostic accuracy for additional suspicious lesions (ASLs).

While the number of ICU-AW risk prediction models is increasing, the quality and applicability of these models in clinical practice remain unclear. The objective of this study was to systematically review published studies on risk prediction models for ICU-AW. We searched electronic databases (PubMed, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, Embase, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), China Science and Technology Periodical Database (VIP), and Wanfang Database) from inception to October 2023 for studies on ICU-AW risk prediction models. Two independent researchers screened the literature, extracted data, and assessed the risk of bias and applicability of the included studies. A total of 2709 articles were identified. After screening, 25 articles were selected, encompassing 25 risk prediction models. The area under the curve for these models ranged from 0.681 to 0.926. Evaluation of bias risk indicated that all included models exhibited a high risk of bias, with three models demonstrating poor applicability. The top five predictors among these models were mechanical ventilation duration, age, Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation II score, blood lactate levels, and the length of ICU stay. The combined area under the curve of the ten validation models was 0.83 (95% confidence interval: 0.77-0.88), indicating a strong discriminative ability. Overall, ICU-AW risk prediction models demonstrate promising discriminative ability. However, further optimisation is needed to address limitations, including data source heterogeneity, potential biases in study design, and the need for robust statistical validation. Future efforts should prioritise external validation of existing models or the development of high-quality predictive models with superior performance.

Of those, 229 patients were assigned to the training and 98 to the testing sets. The Chi-square, Mann-Whitney U, and t-tests were used for baseline analyses. The feature variables selection used the RF algorithms, and the decision tree model was trained on 299 examples and validated on 98. The sensitivity, specificity, recall, F1 score, and area under the curve were used to test the model's performance. The RF algorithms identified the preheating time, the volume of flushing fluids, the intraoperative infusion volume, the anesthesia time, the surgical time, and the core temperature after intubation as risk factors for IOH. The decision tree was grown to 5 levels with 9 terminal nodes. The overall incidence of IOH was 42.13%.

The Dao-LIPV distance was measured from preablation pulmonary vein computed tomography. Patients were assigned to groups on the basis of the presence of LIPV triggers or drivers. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify risk factors. A total of 886 consecutive patients with drug-refractory AF were studied, and 63 (7.1%) patients were identified to have LIPV triggers or drivers. The Dao-LIPV distance had a better predictive performance (area under the curve, 0.70) compared with persistent AF (area under the curve, 0.57). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that Dao-LIPV distance ≤2.5 mm (odds ratio, 3.96; 95% CI, 2.15-7.29; P < .001) and persistent AF (odds ratio, 1.73; 95% CI, 1.02-2.94]; P = .044) were independent predictors for the presence of LIPV triggers or drivers.

There has never been an objective evaluation of minimally invasive donor hepatectomy-DWIT on allograft function in living donor liver transplantation. We evaluated the effect of DWIT following robotic donor hepatectomy (RDH) on recipient outcomes and compared them with a matched cohort of open donor hepatectomy (ODH). Demographic, perioperative, and recipient's postoperative outcome data for all right lobe (RL)-RDH performed between September 2019 and July 2023 were analyzed and compared with a propensity score matched cohort (1:1) of RL-ODH from the same time period. Of a total of 103 RL-RDH and 446 RL-ODH, unmatched and propensity score matched analysis (1:1) revealed a significantly longer DWIT in the RDH group as compared to the ODH group (9.33 ± 3.95 vs 2.87 ± 2.13, P < .0001). This did not translate into any difference in the rates of early allograft dysfunction (EAD), biliary complications, major morbidity, or overall 1-and 3-month survival. The receiver operating characteristic curve analysis threshold for DWIT-early allograft dysfunction was 9 minutes (area under receiver operating characteristic: 0.67, sensitivity = 80%, specificity = 53.8%). We show that prolonged DWIT within an acceptable range in RDH does not have deleterious effects on short-term recipient outcomes.

Patients were randomly divided into a training (n = 140) or validation cohort (n = 59). Radiomics features were extracted within the whole volume tumor on ADC maps (b = 0, 1000 s/mm2), DWIb1000, DWIb2000, and DWIb3000, respectively. Five prediction models based on selected features were developed using logistic regression analysis. The performance of radiomics models was evaluated with a receiver operating characteristic curve, calibration, and decision curve analysis (DCA). The mean signal intensity of the tumor (SItumor), signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), and artifact and anatomic differentiability score gradually were decreased as the b-value increased. However, the contrast-to-noise (CNR) on DWIb2000 was superior to those of DWIb1000 and DWIb3000 (4.58 ± 0.86, 3.82 ± 0.77, 4.18 ± 0.84, p < 0.001, respectively). The overall image quality score of DWIb2000 was higher than that of DWIb3000 (p < 0.001) and showed no significant difference between DWIb1000 and DWIb2000 (p = 0.059). The area under curve (AUC) value of the radiomics model based on DWIb2000 (0.728) was higher than conventional ADC maps (0.690), DWIb1000 (0.699), and DWIb3000 (0.707), but inferior to multi-b-value DWI (0.739) in predicting LNM. DWIb2000 provides better lesion conspicuity and LNM prediction than DWIb1000 and DWIb3000 in RC. DWIb2000 offers satisfactory visualization of lesions. Radiomics features based on DWIb2000 can be applied for preoperatively predicting regional lymph node metastasis in rectal cancer, thereby benefiting the stratified treatment strategy. Lymph node staging is required to determine the best treatment plan for rectal cancer. DWIb2000 provides superior contrast-to-noise ratio and lesion conspicuity and its derived radiomics best predict lymph node metastasis. DWIb2000 may be recommended as the optimal b-value in rectal MRI protocol.","2025","European radiology"

We retrospectively included 324 patients with surgically confirmed HCC who underwent preoperative dynamic CT and MRI with extracellular contrast agent between June 2019 and August 2020. These patients were then divided into a discovery cohort (n = 227) and a validation cohort (n = 97). Imaging features and Liver Imaging Reporting and Data System (LI-RADS) categories of VETC-positive HCCs were evaluated. Logistic regression analyses were conducted on the discovery cohort to identify clinical and imaging predictors associated with VETC-positive cases. Subsequently, separate CT-based and MRI-based scoring models were developed, and their diagnostic performance was compared using generalized estimating equations. On both CT and MRI, VETC-positive HCCs exhibited a higher frequency of size > 5.0 cm, necrosis or severe ischemia, non-smooth tumor margin, targetoid appearance, intratumor artery, and heterogeneous enhancement with septations or irregular ring-like structure compared to VETC-negative HCCs (all p < 0.05). Regarding LI-RADS categories, VETC-positive HCCs were more frequently categorized as LR-M than VETC-negative cases (all p < 0.05). In the validation cohort, the CT-based model showed similar sensitivity (76.7% vs. 86.7%, p = 0.375), specificity (83.6% vs. 74.6%, p = 0.180), and area under the curve value (0.80 vs. 0.81, p = 0.910) to the MRI-based model in predicting VETC-positive HCCs. Preoperative CT and MRI demonstrated comparable performance in the identification of VETC-positive HCCs, thus displaying promising predictive capabilities. Both computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging demonstrated promise in preoperatively identifying the vessel-encapsulating tumor cluster pattern in hepatocellular carcinoma, with no statistically significant difference between the two modalities, potentially adding additional prognostic value. Computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) show promise in the preoperative identification of vessels encapsulating tumor clusters-positive hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). HCC with vessels encapsulating tumor cluster patterns were more frequently LR-M compared to those without. These CT and MRI models showed comparable ability in identifying vessels encapsulating tumor clusters-positive HCC.","2025","European radiology"

A consecutive series of patients with HCC scheduled for locoregional treatment were enrolled between April 2021 and March 2023. Patients were randomly divided into 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging group (3D/fusion group) or 2D-CEUS group (2D group). CEUS was performed 1 week before and 4-6 weeks after locoregional treatment. Contrast-enhanced MRI (CE-MRI) 4-6 weeks after treatment was set as the reference standard. CEUS images were evaluated for the presence or absence of viable tumors. Diagnostic performance criteria, including sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, and area under the curve (AUC), were determined for each modality. A total of 140 patients were included, 70 patients in the 2D group (mean age, 60.2 ± 10.4 years) and 70 patients in the 3D/fusion group (mean age, 59.8 ± 10.6 years). The sensitivity of the 3D/fusion group was 100.0% (95% CI: 75.9, 100.0), higher than that of the 2D group (55.6%, 95% CI: 22.7, 84.7; p = 0.019). The specificity of the 3D/fusion group was 96.3% (95% CI: 86.2, 99.4), which was comparable to that of the 2D group (98.4%, 95% CI: 90.0, 99.9; p = 0.915). The AUC of the 3D/fusion group was 0.98 (95% CI: 0.95, 1.00), higher than that of the 2D group (0.77, 95% CI: 0.56, 0.98; p = 0.020). 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging exhibits superior diagnostic accuracy in evaluating the treatment response to locoregional therapies for HCC. 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging can be applied for post-treatment assessment of residual tumors in HCC undergoing locoregional treatment, offering potential benefits in terms of accurate diagnosis and clinical management. Evaluating for HCC recurrence following locoregional therapy is important. 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging achieved a higher sensitivity than 2D-CEUS in assessing residual tumors after locoregional therapies. 3D-CEUS/MRI-CEUS fusion imaging can help clinicians intervene early in residual HCC lesions after locoregional treatment.","2025","European radiology"

The aim of this study was to establish a radiomic-based model to predict SVCF and specify appropriate treatment strategies. Patients diagnosed with osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture (OVCF) and undergoing VA surgery at our center between 2017 and 2021 were subject to a retrospective analysis. Radiological features of the T6-L5 vertebrae were derived from CT images. Clustering analysis, t-test, and LASSO (least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) regression were used to identify the optimization characteristics. A radiological signature model was constructed through the best combination of 13 machine learning algorithms. Radiomics signature was integrated with clinical characteristics into a nomogram for clinical applications. The model reliability was assessed by receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, calibration curve, clinical decision analysis (DCA), log-rank test, and confusion matrix. A total of 470 eligible patients (81 with SVCF and 389 without) were identified in the clinical cohort. Eight radiomics features were identified and incorporated into machine learning, and ""XGBoost"" model showed the best performance. Final logistic nomogram included radiomics signature (P < 0.001), bone cement volume (P = 0.034), and T-scores of L1-L4 (P = 0.001), and showed satisfactory prediction capability in training set (0.986, 95%CI 0.969-1.000) and verification set (0.884, 95%CI 0.823-0.946).

A retrospective continuous collection of HICH patients from three medical centers was divided into a training set (n = 555), a validation set (n = 239), and a test set (n = 77). Extract radiomics features from baseline CT plain scan images and combine them with clinical information and conventional imaging signs to construct radiomics models, clinical imaging sign models, and hybrid models, respectively. The models will be evaluated using the area under the curve (AUC), clinical decision curve analysis (DCA), net reclassification index (NRI), and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). In the training, validation, and testing sets, the radiomics model predicts an AUC of HE of 0.885, 0.827, and 0.894, respectively, while the clinical imaging sign model predicts an AUC of HE of 0.759, 0.725, and 0.765, respectively. Glasgow coma scale score at admission, first CT hematoma volume, irregular hematoma shape, and radiomics score were used to construct a hybrid model, with AUCs of 0.901, 0.838, and 0.917, respectively. The DCA shows that the hybrid model had the highest net profit rate. Compared with the radiomics model and the clinical imaging sign model, the hybrid model showed an increase in NRI and IDI. The hybrid model based on CT radiomics combined with clinical and radiological factors can effectively individualize the evaluation of the risk of HE in patients with HICH. CT radiomics combined with clinical information and conventional imaging signs can identify HICH patients with a high risk of HE and provide a basis for clinical-targeted treatment. HE is an important prognostic factor in patients with HICH. The hybrid model predicted HE with training, validation, and test AUCs of 0.901, 0.838, and 0.917, respectively.

A total of 630 lesions, 393 malignant and 237 benign, 458 mass and 172 NME, were analyzed. Three radiologists with 3 years, 6 years, and 13 years of experience made diagnoses. 596 cases had diffusion-weighted imaging, and the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) was measured. For lesions with ADC > 1.4 × 10-3 mm2/s, the KS was reduced by 4 as the modified KS +, and the benefit was assessed. When using BI-RADS, AUC was 0.878, 0.915, and 0.941 for mass, and 0.771, 0.838, 0.902 for NME for Reader-1, 2, and 3, respectively, better for mass than for NME. The diagnostic accuracy of KS was improved compared to BI-RADS for less experienced readers. For Reader-1, AUC was increased from 0.878 to 0.916 for mass (p = 0.005) and from 0.771 to 0.822 for NME (p = 0.124). Based on the cut-off value of BI-RADS ≥ 4B and KS ≥ 5 as malignant, the sensitivity of KS by Readers-1 and -2 was significantly higher for both Mass and NME. When ADC was considered to change to modified KS +, the AUC and the accuracy for all three readers were improved, showing higher specificity with slightly degraded sensitivity. The benefit of KS compared to BI-RADS was most noticeable for the less experienced readers in improving sensitivity. Compared to KS, KS + can improve specificity for all three readers. For NME, the KS and KS + criteria need to be further improved. KS provides an intuitive method for diagnosing lesions on breast MRI. BI-RADS and KS face greater difficulties in evaluating NME compared to mass lesions. Adding ADC to the KS can improve specificity with slightly degraded sensitivity. KS provides an intuitive method for interpreting breast lesions on MRI, most helpful for novice readers. KS, compared to BI-RADS, improved sensitivity in both mass and NME groups for less experienced readers. NME lesions were considered during the development of the KS flowchart, but may need to be better defined.","2025","European radiology"

Conventional CT features and iodine concentration (IC) were analyzed and measured. Radiomics features were derived from venous phase iodine maps from DLSCT. The least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) was performed for feature selection. Finally, a support vector machine (SVM) algorithm was employed to develop clinical, radiomics, and combined models based on the most valuable clinical parameters and radiomics features. Area under receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC), calibration curves, and decision curve analysis were used to evaluate the model's efficacy. The combined model incorporating the valuable clinical parameters and radiomics features demonstrated excellent performance in predicting TDs in CRC (AUCs of 0.926, 0.881, and 0.887 in the training, testing, and external validation cohorts, respectively), which outperformed the clinical model in the training cohort and external validation cohorts (AUC: 0.839 and 0.695; p: 0.003 and 0.014) and the radiomics model in two cohorts (AUC: 0.922 and 0.792; p: 0.014 and 0.035). Radiomics analysis of DLSCT-derived iodine maps showed excellent predictive efficiency for preoperatively diagnosing TDs in CRC, and could guide clinicians in making individualized treatment strategies. The radiomics model based on DLSCT iodine maps has the potential to aid in the accurate preoperative prediction of TDs in CRC patients, offering valuable guidance for clinical decision-making. Accurately predicting TDs in CRC patients preoperatively based on conventional CT features poses a challenge. The Radiomics model based on DLSCT iodine maps outperformed conventional CT in predicting TDs.

A total of 110 patients (69 men; 41 women; mean age 66.5 ± 13.4 years) with 80 lipid-poor adenomas and 30 non-adenomas who underwent non-contrast dual-layer spectral CT and CS-MRI were retrospectively identified. For each lesion, non-contrast attenuation on conventional 120-kVp images, ΔHU-index ([attenuation difference between virtual monoenergetic 140-keV and 40-keV images]/conventional attenuation × 100), and signal intensity index (SI-index) were quantified. Each parameter was compared between adenomas and non-adenomas using the Mann-Whitney U-test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) and sensitivity to achieve > 95% specificity for adenoma diagnosis were determined. Conventional non-contrast attenuation was lower in adenomas than in non-adenomas (22.4 ± 8.6 HU vs 32.8 ± 48.5 HU), whereas ΔHU-index (148.0 ± 103.2 vs 19.4 ± 25.8) and SI-index (41.6 ± 19.6 vs 4.2 ± 10.2) were higher in adenomas (all, p < 0.001). ΔHU-index showed superior performance to conventional non-contrast attenuation (AUC: 0.919 [95% CI: 0.852-0.963] vs 0.791 [95% CI: 0.703-0.863]; sensitivity: 75.0% [60/80] vs 27.5% [22/80], both p < 0.001), and near equivalent to SI-index (AUC: 0.952 [95% CI: 0.894-0.984], sensitivity 85.0% [68/80], both p > 0.05). Both the ΔHU-index and SI-index provided a sensitivity of 96.0% (48/50) for hypoattenuating adenomas (≤ 25 HU). For hyperattenuating (> 25 HU) adenomas, SI-index showed higher sensitivity than ΔHU-index (66.7% [20/30] vs 40.0% [12/30], p = 0.022). Non-contrast spectral CT and CS-MRI outperformed conventional non-contrast CT in distinguishing lipid-poor adenomas from non-adenomas. While CS-MRI demonstrated superior sensitivity for adenomas measuring > 25 HU, non-contrast spectral CT provided high discriminative values for adenomas measuring ≤ 25 HU. Spectral attenuation analysis improves the diagnostic performance of non-contrast CT in discriminating lipid-poor adrenal adenomas, potentially serving as an alternative to CS-MRI and obviating the necessity for additional diagnostic workup in indeterminate adrenal incidentalomas, particularly for lesions measuring ≤ 25 HU. Incidental adrenal lesion detection has increased as abdominal CT use has become more frequent. Non-contrast spectral CT and CS-MRI differentiated lipid-poor adenomas from non-adenomas better than conventional non-contrast CT. For lesions measuring ≤ 25 HU, spectral CT may obviate the need for additional evaluation.","2025","European radiology"

This study included 463 LNs from 399 patients with DTC. Three radiologists independently analyzed strong LN enhancement on CT. Qualitative analysis of strong enhancement was defined as LN cortex showing greater enhancement than adjacent muscles on the arterial phase. Quantitative analysis included the mean attenuation value (MAV) of LN on arterial phase (LNA) and venous phase (LNV), LNA normalized to the common carotid artery (NAVCCA), internal jugular vein (NAVIJV), and sternocleidomastoid muscle (NAVSCM), attenuation difference [AD; (LNA - MAVSCM)], and relative washout ratio [((LNA - LNV)/LNA) × 100]. The interobserver agreement and diagnostic performance of the quantitative and qualitative analyses were evaluated. Interobserver agreement was excellent for all quantitative CT parameters (ICC, 0.83-0.94) and substantial for qualitative assessment (κ = 0.61). All CT parameters except for LNV showed good diagnostic performance for metastatic LNs (AUC, 0.81-0.85). NAVCCA (0.85, 95% CI: 0.8-0.9) and AD (0.85, 95% CI: 0.81-0.89) had the highest AUCs. All quantitative parameters except for NAVIJV had significantly higher AUCs than qualitative assessments by inexperienced radiologists, with no significant difference from assessments by an experienced radiologist. Quantitative assessment of LN enhancement on arterial phase CT showed higher interobserver agreement and AUC values than qualitative analysis by inexperienced radiologists, supporting the need for a standardized quantitative CT parameter-based model for determining strong LN enhancement. When assessing strong LN enhancement in DTC, quantitative CT parameters indicating strong enhancement can improve interobserver agreement, regardless of experience level. Therefore, the development of a standardized diagnostic model based on quantitative CT parameters might be necessary. Accurate preoperative assessment of LN metastasis in thyroid cancer is crucial. Quantitative CT parameters indicating strong LN enhancement demonstrated excellent interobserver agreement and good diagnostic performance. Quantitative assessment of contrast enhancement offers a more objective model for the identification of metastatic LNs.","2025","European radiology"

A total of 80 patients with diagnosed cHCC-CCA were included in the analysis. The median progression-free survival was 15.6 months, while distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), hepatic progression-free survival, and overall survival (OS) were 50.8, 21.5, and 85.1 months, respectively. In 52 cases of recurrence, intrahepatic recurrence was the most common initial recurrence (34/52), with distant metastasis in 17 cases. Factors associated with poor DMFS included tumor necrosis, lymphovascular invasion (LVI), perineural invasion, and histologic compact type. Postoperative carbohydrate antigen 19-9, tumor necrosis, LVI, and close/positive margin were associated with poor OS. LVI emerged as a key factor affecting both DMFS and OS, with a 5-year OS of 93.3% for patients without LVI compared to 35.8% with LVI. Based on these factors, a nomogram predicting 3-year and 5-year DMFS and OS was developed, demonstrating high concordance with actual survival in the cohort (Harrell C-index 0.809 for OS, 0.801 for DMFS, respectively).

Discriminant (known groups) validity was assessed using standardised effect sizes (SES). Internal consistency was tested using Cronbach's alpha. Intrarater reliability in stable patients and equivalence of face-to-face and telephone administration were tested using intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) and Bland-Altman plots. Responsiveness was assessed using standardised response mean (SRM). A receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve anchor-based approach was used to determine clinically meaningful IBMFRS change. Among the 150 patients, mean (SD) IBMFRS total score was 27.4 (4.6). Convergent validity was supported by medium to large correlations (rs modulus: 0.42-0.79) and discriminant validity by moderate to large group differences (SES=0.51-1.59).

We enrolled and tested 46 participants with concussion (age = 15.8 ± 1.3 years, 59% female, mean = 11.3 ± 3.3 days postconcussion) and 83 uninjured controls (age = 16.1 ± 1.4 years, 88% female). The concussion group had significantly worse HRA than controls (4.3 ± 1.6 vs 2.9 ± 0.7 degrees, P < 0.001, Cohen d = 1.19). The univariable HRA model AUC was 0.81 (95% CI = 0.73, 0.90). After adjusting for age, sex, and concussion history, the multivariable model AUC improved to 0.85 (95% CI = 0.77, 0.92). The model correctly classified 80% of participants as concussion/control at a 3.5-degree cutpoint. Adolescents with concussion demonstrated worse cervical spine proprioception than uninjured controls. Head repositioning accuracy may offer diagnostic utility for subacute concussion.","2025","Clinical journal of sport medicine : official journal of the Canadian Academy of Sport Medicine"

As a prospective study, we screened clinical N0 lung cancer patients who were surgical candidates and had undergone both 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography-computed tomography (PET/CT) and chest CT from August 2018 to January 2020. We recruited patients meeting our proposed imaging criteria indicating high-risk, that is, poorer prognosis of lung adenocarcinoma, using CT and FDG PET/CT. If possible, these patients underwent an MRI examination from which we extracted 77 radiomics features from T1-contrast-enhanced and T2-weighted images. Additionally, patient demographics, maximum standardized uptake value on FDG PET/CT, and the mean apparent diffusion coefficient value on diffusion-weighted image, were considered together to build prediction models for high-risk pathologic features. Among 616 patients, 72 patients met the imaging criteria for high-risk lung cancer and underwent lung MRI. The magnetic resonance (MR)-eligible group showed a higher prevalence of nodal upstaging (29.2% vs. 4.2%, p < 0.001), vascular invasion (6.5% vs. 2.1%, p=0.011), high-grade pathologic features (p < 0.001), worse 4-year disease-free survival (p < 0.001) compared with non-MR-eligible group. The prediction power for MR-based radiomics model predicting high-risk pathologic features was good, with mean area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) value measuring 0.751-0.886 in test sets. Adding clinical variables increased the predictive performance for MPsol and the poorly differentiated pattern using the 2021 grading system (AUC, 0.860 and 0.907, respectively). Our imaging criteria can effectively screen high-risk lung cancer patients and predict high-risk pathologic features by our MR-based prediction model using radiomics.","2025","Cancer research and treatment"

This study assessed the prognostic value of Mac-2 binding protein glycosylation isomer (M2BPGi) for early recurrence (ER) in patients with HCC. Patients who underwent radical resection for HCC between 2015 and 2021. HCC recurrence within one year after curative resection was defined as ER. The 150 patients were divided into two groups: non-ER (116, 77.3%) and ER (34, 22.7%). The ER group had a lower overall survival rate (p < 0.0001) and significantly higher levels of M2BPGi (1.06 vs. 2.74 COI, p < 0.0001) than the non-ER group. High M2BPGi levels (odds ratio [OR] 1.78, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.31-2.41, p < 0.0001) and a large tumor size (OR 1.31, 95% CI, 1.05-1.63; p = 0.0184) were identified as independent predictors of ER. M2BPGi was the best predictor of ER according to a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (area under the ROC curve 0.82, p < 0.0001). M2BPGi can predict ER after surgery and is useful for risk stratification in patients with HCC.","2025","Surgery today"

We aimed to identify clinical and echocardiographic factors associated with extensive left atrial myopathy (ELAM), to analyze the predictive ability of established scores (AF score, APPLE, and DR-FLASH) and assess outcomes in terms of AF recurrence, left atrial flutter, and post-procedural heart failure admissions. A total of 950 consecutive patients undergoing the first AF ablation were included. A 3D electroanatomical mapping system (CARTO3, Biosense Webster) was created using a multipolar mapping catheter (PentaRay, Biosense Webster). ELAM was defined as ≥ 50% low voltage area. A subanalysis with four groups was also created (< 10%; 10-20%; 10-20%; and > 30%). Logistic regressions, Cox proportional hazards models, and log-rank test were used to test the predictors independently associated with the presence of ELAM and AF recurrence. The model was prospectively validated in a cohort of 150 patients obtaining an excellent ability for prediction AUC 0.90 (CI 95% 0.84-0.96). Overall, 78 (8.42%) presented ELAM. Age, female sex, persistent AF, first-degree AV block, and E/e' were significant predictors. The model incorporating these factors outperformed the existing scores (AUC = 0.87). During a mean follow-up of 20 months (IQR 9 to 36), patients with ELAM presented a higher rate of AF recurrence (42.02% vs 26.01%, p = 0.030), left atrial flutter (26.03% vs 8.02%, p < 0.001), and post-procedural heart failure admissions (12.01% vs 0.61%, p < 0.001) than non-ELAM patients.

Its detection is challenging, especially among non-experienced physicians. We included patients with CaW from six international trials and registries of patients with acute ischemic stroke. Identification and manual segmentations of CaW were performed by three trained radiologists. We designed a two-stage segmentation strategy based on a convolutional neural network (CNN). At the first stage, the two carotid arteries were segmented using a U-shaped CNN. At the second stage, the segmentation of the CaW was first confined to the vicinity of the carotid arteries. Then, the carotid bifurcation region was localized by the proposed carotid bifurcation localization algorithm followed by another U-shaped CNN. A volume threshold based on the derived CaW manual segmentation statistics was then used to determine whether or not CaW was present. We included 58 patients (median (IQR) age 59 (50-75) years, 60% women). The Dice similarity coefficient and 95th percentile Hausdorff distance between manually segmented CaW and the algorithm segmented CaW were 63.20±19.03% and 1.19±0.9 mm, respectively. Using a volume threshold of 5 mm3, binary classification detection metrics for CaW on a single artery were as follows: accuracy: 92.2% (95% CI 87.93% to 96.55%), precision: 94.83% (95% CI 88.68% to 100.00%), sensitivity: 90.16% (95% CI 82.16% to 96.97%), specificity: 94.55% (95% CI 88.0% to 100.0%), F1 measure: 0.9244 (95% CI 0.8679 to 0.9692), area under the curve: 0.9235 (95%CI 0.8726 to 0.9688).

Identifying patients at risk for transfusion remains important for risk reduction and to determine type and screen testing. We reviewed 6,405 patients who underwent primary, unilateral THA between January 2014 and January 2023 at a single academic institution, received TXA, and had preoperative hemoglobin (Hgb) values. We compared demographics, baseline Hgb levels, and surgical details between patients who were and were not transfused. Data were analyzed utilizing multivariate regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The overall perioperative and intraoperative transfusion rates were 3.4 and 1.0%, respectively. Patients who were older, women, and American Society of Anesthesiologists class >II demonstrated an increased risk of transfusion. Risk of transfusion demonstrated an inverse correlation with preoperative Hgb levels, a bimodal association with body mass index, and a direct correlation with age, surgical time, and estimated blood loss on multivariate analysis. The receiver operating characteristic analysis demonstrated a preoperative Hgb cutoff of 12 g/dL for predicting any transfusion. Above the threshold of 12 g/dL, total and intraoperative transfusions were rare, with rates of 1.7 and 0.3%, respectively. Total and intraoperative transfusion rates with Hgb between 11 and 12 g/dL were 14.3 and 4.6%, respectively. Below 11 g/dL, total and intraoperative transfusion rates were 27.5 and 10.1%, respectively. In the age of TXA, blood transfusion is rare in THA when preoperative Hgb is >12 g/dL, challenging the need for universal type and screening. Conversely, patients who have Hgb < 11.0 g/dL, remain at substantial risk for transfusion. Between Hgb 11 and 12 g/dL, patient age, sex, body mass index, American Society of Anesthesiologists classification, anticipated estimated blood loss, and surgical time may help predict transfusion risk and the need for a perioperative type and screen.

The aim of this work was to investigate the ability of MRI metrics to predict postoperative outcomes. A total of 55 children with hydrocephalus who underwent MRI and ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery were prospectively enrolled. MRI was also performed at 6 months postoperatively in 33 of the 55 children. A total of 92 controls matched for age and sex were enrolled and divided into preoperative and postoperative control groups. We calculated the diffusion tensor imaging along the perivascular space (DTI-ALPS) index, Evans index, and diffusion tensor imaging metrics. The ability of various metrics to predict postoperative outcomes was assessed using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. The DTI-ALPS index was significantly lower in patients with hydrocephalus than in controls. The abnormal DTI-ALPS index trended toward the normal range after surgery. Patients with lower preoperative DTI-ALPS index, lower fractional anisotropy (FA), and higher radial diffusivity in association fibers had less favorable short-term outcomes. Patients with worse long-term outcomes had lower postoperative DTI-ALPS index, higher postoperative Evans index, and lower FA and higher radial diffusivity in association fibers. Predictive performance was better when the DTI-ALPS index and FA in association fibers were used in combination than when either of these metrics was used alone. The DTI-ALPS index and FA in association fibers provided complementary information for prognostic assessment after the ventriculoperitoneal shunt surgery on pediatric hydrocephalus. A combination of DTI-ALPS index and FA would improve our ability to predict postoperative outcomes in these patients.","2025","Neurosurgery"

This prospective cohort study was conducted at The US Military Academy at West Point. Cadets underwent a standard battery of tests including Balance Error Scoring System, Sports Concussion Assessment Tool Fifth Edition Symptom Survey, Standard Assessment of Concussion, and measure of pupillary responses. Cadets who sustained an mTBI during training events or sports were evaluated with the same battery of tests and pupillometry within 48 hours of the injury (T1), at the initiation of a graded return to activity protocol (T2), and at unrestricted return to activity (T3). Pupillary light reflex metrics were obtained in 1300 cadets at baseline. During the study period, 68 cadets sustained mTBIs. At T1 (<48 hours), cadets manifested significant postconcussion symptoms (Sports Concussion Assessment Tool Fifth Edition P < .001), and they had decreased cognitive performance (Standardized Assessment of Concussion P < .001) and higher balance error scores (Balance Error Scoring System P < .001) in comparison with their baseline assessment (T0). The clinical parameters showed normalization at time points T2 and T3. The pupillary responses demonstrated a pattern of significant change that returned to normal for several measures, including the difference between the constricted and initial pupillary diameter (T1 P < .001, T2 P < .05), dilation velocity (T1 P < .01, T2 P < .001), and percent of pupillary constriction (T1 P < .05). In addition, a combination of dilation velocity and maximum constriction velocity demonstrates moderate prediction ability regarding who can return to duty before or after 21 days (area under the curve = 0.71, 95% CI [0.56-0.86]).

The study comprised 44 individuals between the ages of seven and 14, 22 with HL (N = 11 males) and 22 with normal hearing (N = 10 males). Individuals' auditory attention, working memory, and auditory processing skills were assessed in the study, and self-report questionnaires were used. The evaluation utilized the Sustained Auditory Attention Capacity Test (SAACT), Working Memory Scale (WMS), Filtered Words Test, Auditory Figured Ground Test (AFGT), and the Children's Auditory Performance Scale (CHAPS). Analyses were conducted, including group comparisons, correlation examinations, and receiver operating characteristic evaluations. There were significant differences in CHAPS total, attention, noise, quiet, and multiple inputs between groups. No significant differences were seen in CHAPS_ideal and CHAPS_auditory memory across groups. The study of SAACT and its subscores, WMS and its subscores, FWT, and AFGT revealed a significant difference between groups, caused by the poor performance of persons in the HL group compared to those in the NH group. The SAACT and its subscores correlated significantly with CHAPS_attention. The AUC calculation showed that The SAACT and CHAPS_attention distinguished persons with or without HL (p < 0.05). WMS_STM and WMS_total correlated with CHAPS auditory memory subscale; however, WMS_VWM did not. AUC values for WMS and its subscores showed significant discrimination in identifying children with or without HL (p < 0.05), whereas CHAPS_auditory memory did not (AUC = 0.665; p = 0.060). FWT and AFGT had a significant relationship with CHAPS_noise and CHAPS_multiple inputs subscales. The CHAPS_quiet and CHAPS_ideal subtests only correlated with AFGT. CHAPS_quite and CHAPS_ideal did not exhibit significant discriminative values (p < 0.05) for identifying children with or without HL, while CHAPS_noise, CHAPS_multiple inputs, FWT, and AFGT did. The CHAPS_attention subscale could be a trustworthy instrument for assessing auditory attention in children with HL. However, the CHAPS_auditory memory subscale may not be suitable for testing working memory. While performance-based auditory processing tests showed improved discrimination, the CHAPS_noise and CHAPS_multiple inputs subtests can still assess hearing-impaired auditory processing.

Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM) is a common spinal cord disorder necessitating surgery. We aim to explore how effectively diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) can distinguish DCM from healthy individuals and assess the relationship between DTI metrics and symptom severity. We included studies with adult DCM patients who had not undergone decompressive surgery and implemented correlation analyses between DTI parameters and severity, or compared healthy controls and DCM patients. 57 studies were included in our meta-analysis. At the maximal compression (MC) level, fractional anisotropy (FA) exhibited lower values in DCM patients, while apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), mean diffusivity (MD), and radial diffusivity (RD) were notably higher in the DCM group. Moreover, our investigation into the diagnostic utility of DTI parameters disclosed high sensitivity, specificity, and area under the curve values for FA (.84, .80, .83 respectively) and ADC (.74, .84, .88 respectively). Additionally, we explored the correlation between DTI parameters and myelopathy severity, revealing a significant correlation of FA (.53, 95% CI:0.40 to .65) at MC level with JOA/mJOA scores. Current guidelines for DCM suggest decompressive surgery for both mild and severe cases. However, they lack clear recommendations on which mild DCM patients might benefit from conservative treatment vs immediate surgery. ADC's role here could be pivotal, potentially differentiating between healthy individuals and DCM. While it may not correlate with symptom severity, it might predict surgical outcomes, making it a valuable imaging biomarker for clearer management decisions in mild DCM.","2025","Global spine journal"

Some of the clues from the preoperative assessment were used to build a nomogram to predict the likely pathological escalation after surgery, and to explore the feasibility of sentinel lymph node biopsy in these patients with possible pathological escalation. This was a retrospective analysis of patients who underwent surgical treatment for EIN diagnosed before surgery between 2018 and 2023 in The Obstetrics and Gynecology Hospital of Fudan University. parameters including clinical, radiological and histopathological factors were analyzed by univariate and multivariate logistic regression to determine the correlation with pathology upstaging. A nomogram based on the multivariate results was developed to predict the probability of pathology upstaging. A total of 729 patients were included, divided into training set and validation set. 484 patients were used to build the model. This nomogram was subsequently validated using 245 patients. Upstaging to endometrial carcinoma occurred in 115 (23.8 percent) of 484 women treated between 2018 and 2023 in training set. A lager endometrial thickness (at least 15 mm), menopause, hypertension, HE4, and endometrial blood were significantly associated with upstaging. A nomogram developed using these factors demonstrated good predictive performance (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC)=0.6808; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.6246-0.7369). The nomogram showed similar predictive performance in the validation data set, based on another 245 women (AUC=0.7821; 95% CI=0.7076-0.8567). This study developed a novel nomogram based on the 5 most important factors, which can accurately predict invasive cancer. It is common for women with preoperative diagnosis of EIN to experience pathological progression to endometrial cancer. For some patients with postoperative pathological escalation, we found lymph node metastasis. This nomogram may be useful to help doctor decide whether to perform sentinel lymph node biopsy for surgical staging in these EIN patients. According to the nomogram, simultaneous sentinel lymph node biopsy in patients with high probability of postoperative pathological upgrading can provide better guidance for postoperative adjuvant treatment of endometrial cancer and avoid the occurrence of secondary surgery.","2025","Journal of gynecologic oncology"

PROMs have become key determinants in spine surgery outcomes studies. MIC and PASS were established to aid PROM interpretations. However, their long-term stability has not yet been reported. A consecutive series of elective lumbar fusions were followed up using the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain. Improvement was rated by a 4-point Likert scale into ""improved"" or ""nonimproved."" Satisfaction-to-treatment was rated by the patients' willingness to undergo surgery again. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve analysis estimated MIC (95% confidence interval, CI) as the PROM change that best predicted improvement at distinct time-points. PASS (CI) was estimated as the lowest PROM score at which the patients were still satisfied. Heterogeneity across thresholds was evaluated using the DeLong algorithm. MIC for ODI represented heterogeneity across 10 years, ranging from -21 (-24 to -16) at two years to -8 (-7 to -4) at five years, P<0.001. The areas under the ROC curves (AUCs) (0.79 to 0.85) indicated acceptable to excellent discrimination. Heterogeneity was not significant in the MICs for the pain scores. At one year, MIC for back pain was -24 (-38 to -15), AUC 0.77, and for leg pain, it was -26 (-44 to -8), AUC 0.78. No significant heterogeneity was observed in 10-year PASS scores.

Limited research exists on the influence of area-level socioeconomic status and outcomes after TBI. This study investigated the correlation between the Area Deprivation Index (ADI) and (1) 90-day hospital readmission rates, (2) facility discharge, and (3) prolonged (≥5 days) hospital length of stay (LOS). Single-center retrospective review of adult (18 years or older) patients who were admitted for TBI during 2018 was performed. Patients were excluded if they were admitted for management of a chronic or subacute hematoma. We extracted relevant clinical and demographic data including sex, comorbidities, age, body mass index, smoking status, TBI mechanism, and national ADI. We categorized national ADI rankings into quartiles for analysis. Univariate, multivariate, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) analyses were performed to assess the relationship between ADI and 90-day readmission, hospital LOS, and discharge disposition. A total of 523 patients were included in final analysis. Patients from neighborhoods in the fourth ADI quartile were more likely to be Black ( P = .007), have a body mass index ≥30 kg/m 2 ( P = .03), have a Charlson Comorbidity Index ≥5 ( P = .004), and have sustained a penetrating TBI ( P = .01). After controlling for confounders in multivariate analyses, being from a neighborhood in the fourth ADI quartile was independently predictive of 90-day hospital readmission (odds ratio [OR]: 1.35 [1.12-1.91], P = .011) (model AUROC: 0.82), discharge to a facility (OR: 1.46 [1.09-1.78], P = .03) (model AUROC: 0.79), and prolonged hospital LOS (OR: 1.95 [1.29-2.43], P = .015) (model AUROC: 0.85). After adjusting for confounders, including comorbidities, TBI mechanism/severity, and age, higher ADI was independently predictive of longer hospital LOS, increased risk of 90-day readmission, and nonhome discharge. These results may help establish targeted interventions to identify at-risk patients after TBI.","2025","Neurosurgery"

Oral acetazolamide, a systemic CAI, is used in horses with hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. Information regarding its effect on equine intraocular pressure (IOP) is scarce. The aim of the study was to determine the effect of oral acetazolamide treatment on IOP in horses, in a case-control study. Ten healthy horses. Horses were treated with oral acetazolamide (4.4 mg/kg) BID for 1 week. Serum acetazolamide concentrations were determined by liquid chromatography/tandem mass spectrometry, and IOP were measured before treatment, daily during treatment, and at 48 and 72 h after treatment. Acetazolamide serum levels reached steady state at 72 h after the first oral dose. In a mixed effect model logistic regression, there was a significant decrease in IOP on the third treatment day, of 2.4 mmHg (p = .012) and 2.7 mmHg (p = .006) in the left (OS) and right eye (OD), respectively. On the seventh day, there was a decrease in 2.5 mmHg (p = .008) and 2.7 mmHg (p = .007) OS and OD, respectively. A significant increase occurred 48 h following treatment discontinuation (3.6 mmHg, p < .001 and 3.5 mmHg, p < .001 OS and OD, respectively). The area under the concentration versus time curve (AUC(0-10h)) was 1.1 ± 0.5 μg/mL*h, mean residence time 6.7 ± 4.3 h, peak plasma concentration (Cmax) 0.4 ± 0.4 μg/mL and time to reach Cmax 1.8 h. There was a significant increase in serum concentrations 1, 2, 48, 72, and 156 h following the first drug administration (p < .05).

The transcriptome data of brain tissue in AD patients were screened from the GEO database, and pyroptosis-related genes were analyzed. The functions of differential genes were analyzed by enrichment analysis and protein-protein interaction. The diagnostic model was established using LASSO and logistic regression analysis, and the correlation of clinical data was analyzed. Based on single-cell analysis of brain tissues of patients with AD, immunofluorescence and western blotting were used to explore the key cells affected by the hub gene. After GSEA, qRT-PCR, western blotting, LDH, ROS, and JC-1 were used to investigate the potential mechanism of the hub gene on pyroptosis. A total of 15 pyroptosis differentially expressed genes were identified. A prediction model consisting of six genes was established by LASSO and logistic regression analysis, and the area under the curve was up to 0.81. As a hub gene, CHMP4B was negatively correlated with the severity of AD. CHMP4B expression was decreased in the hippocampal tissue of patients with AD and mice. Single-cell analysis showed that CHMP4B was downregulated in AD microglia. Overexpression of CHMP4B reduced the release of LDH and ROS and restored mitochondrial membrane potential, thereby alleviating the inflammatory response during microglial pyroptosis. In summary, CHMP4B as a hub gene provides a new strategy for the diagnosis and treatment of AD.","2025","Molecular neurobiology"

The present study aims at comparing the levels of 5 specific miRNAs (miR-29b-3p, miR-34a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-181a-5p, and miR-192-5p) in patients with periodontal disease and healthy controls. The pathogenic mechanism is related to the activation of immune response and significant alteration of coding and noncoding genes, including miRNA. The study includes 50 subjects (17 with periodontal disease and 33 healthy controls) with a mean age of 45.3 y. In both periodontitis patients and healthy controls, a panel of 5 miRNAs (miR-29b-3p, miR-34a-5p, miR-155-5p, miR-181a-5p, and miR-192-5p) is examined by determining their expression levels with quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. The periodontitis patients express high levels of all the investigated miRNAs. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis shows an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.69 to 0.74 for individual transcripts with the highest AUC value observed for miR-192, followed by miR-181a. The study indicates that the 5-miRNA panel can be used as biomarker for periodontitis. In this way, all implantology procedures and treatment options for patients diagnosed with periodontitis can be improved for better long-term results, predictability, and follow-up frequency. The discovery of a miRNA panel as a potential biomarker for periodontitis offers major opportunities for practical application.

Patients with cystic OLTs who underwent BMS between January 2016 and February 2021 were retrospectively analyzed, and the minimum follow-up time was more than 24 months. Patients were paired in a 1:1 ratio (medial cystic OLT [MC-OLT]/lateral cystic OLT [LC-OLT]) based on the OLT area within 30 mm2, follow-up within 1 year, age within 5 years, and ligament surgery (yes/no). The visual analog scale and Foot and Ankle Ability Measure (FAAM)-Activities of Daily Life and Sports scores were assessed preoperatively and postoperatively. The magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue scores and presence of cysts after BMS were also evaluated. Additionally, the receiver operating characteristic curve was performed. The matched patients were divided into the MC-OLT (n = 31, 43.35 ± 12.32 months) and LC-OLT groups (n = 31, 43.32 ± 14.88 months, P = .986). Thirty patients of each group achieved a power of 80% and an α = 0.05 in this study. The MC-OLT group showed significantly less improvement in FAAM-Activities of Daily Life and sports scores (P = .034, P < .001, respectively), lower magnetic resonance observation of cartilage repair tissue scores (80.80 ± 11.91 vs 86.00 ± 8.50, P = .010), and higher presence rate of cysts after BMS (45.16% vs 16.12%, P = .013). Regarding FAAM sports scores, the LC-OLT group had significantly more patients exceeding the minimal clinically important difference (80.64% vs 51.61%, P = .031). Furthermore, an OLT depth of 7.23 mm (sensitivity: 78.6%; specificity: 70.6%) might serve as a cutoff value for predicting the presence of cysts in medial cystic OLTs following BMS. Medial cystic OLTs exhibited markedly lower sports levels, higher cyst presence rate, and inferior radiologic outcomes following BMS than lateral counterparts. Additionally, an OLT depth of 7.23 mm could be the cutoff value for predicting the presence of cysts regarding medial cystic OLTs after BMS.

The aim of this study is to identify factors associated with dissatisfaction 1 year after TKA. A total of 236 patients undergoing TKA were included in this prospective cohort study. Demographic data, preoperative clinical parameters (e.g., axial alignment, osteoarthritis severity) and patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs) were collected preoperatively, at 1 month and 1 year after TKA, encompassing the Knee Society Score (KSS) and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). The primary outcome was dissatisfaction 1 year after TKA, defined as ≤20 points on the KSS satisfaction scale. A risk score based on multiple regression and area under the curve (AUC) analyses was calculated to predict dissatisfaction. One year after TKA, 16% of the patients were dissatisfied. Dissatisfied patients were significantly younger (p = 0.023) and had a higher body mass index (BMI) (p = 0.007). No differences were observed in preoperative objective (p = 0.903) and functional KSS (p = 0.346), pain (p = 0.306), osteoarthritis severity (p = 0.358), axial knee alignment (p = 0.984) or psychological distress (p = 0.138). The likelihood of dissatisfaction at 1 year was 3.0, 4.0, 7.4, 4.3 and 2.8 times higher amongst patients aged <63.5 years, with a BMI > 30.1 kg/m2, a KOOSPain < 50%, a KSSFunction < 42 points and a KSSExpectation < 9 points (all at 1 month), respectively. Using these variables, a risk score with a maximum of 7 points was developed, demonstrating a high predictive value for dissatisfaction (AUC: 0.792 [95% confidence interval: 0.700-0.884], p < 0.001). Dissatisfaction 1 year after TKA can be predicted by a weighted risk score that includes patient age, BMI, pain, subjective functionality and unmet expectation 1 month postoperatively.

Blood samples were prospectively collected from 45 patients with stage IIIA (N2) non-small cell lung cancer undergoing neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. An integrated model, combining the computed tomography-based DL score, bTMB, and clinical factors, was developed to predict tumor response to neoadjuvant chemoimmunotherapy. At baseline, bTMB were detected in 77.8% (35 of 45) of patients. Baseline bTMB ≥11 mutations/megabase was associated with significantly greater MPR rates (77.8% vs 38.5%, P = .042), and longer disease-free survival (P = .043), but not overall survival (P = .131), compared with bTMB <11 mutations/megabase in 35 patients with bTMB available.

In the training cohort, a wheelchair usage telemonitoring device monitored the battery usage of n=119 power wheelchair users for 12 months. Users whose battery charging behavior was not optimal were instructed on appropriate charging practices. Wheelchair usage parameters of wheelchair drive and power time every month were used to predict repairs and associated costs.Results: Fifty-four out of 119 users in the training cohort did not charge batteries regularly and were instructed on appropriate charging. Twenty-six of them changed their behavior and charged their batteries every night. This cohort experienced reduced battery repairs by 18%, wheelchair repairs by 11%, and repair costs by £3,092 compared to a matched standard care cohort (n=118). User age and drive time were associated with repair measures. Drive time predicted time-to-failure for wheelchair parts and classified failure risk with the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve as 0.71 (95% CI 0.61 to 0.82; p<.001). Conclusions: By leveraging the significant relationships between wheelchair usage and repairs, wheelchair users at risk of part failures can be identified, and technician-led servicing tools for proactive interventions can be developed.

This study was prospective and observational. The demographic features of the patients, comorbidities, vital signs, PESI score, PI, treatment applied to the patient and airway management, right ventricular diameter/left ventricular diameter ratio, length of hospital stay, outcome, and 30-day mortality were recorded. A total of 94 patients were included. All patients' vital signs and PI values were recorded on admission. The mean pulse rate (p = 0.001) and shock index (p = 0.017) values of deceased patients were statistically significantly higher, while the mean PI (p = 0.034) was statistically significantly lower. PESI score and PI were statistically significant to predict the need for mechanical ventilation (PI, p = 0.004; PESI score, p < 0.001), inotropic treatment (PI, p = 0.047; PESI score p = 0.005), and thrombolytic therapy (PI, p = 0.035; PESI score p = 0.003). According to the ROC curve, the mortality prediction power of both PESI (AUC: 0.787, 95% CI 0.688-0.886, cutoff: 109.5, p < 0.001) and PI index (AUC: 0.668, 95% CI 0.543-0.793, cutoff: 1, p = 0.011) were determined as statistically significant.

To characterize HCC image subtypes in MRI and correlate subtypes with recurrence. Retrospective. A total of 440 patients (training cohort = 213, internal test cohort = 140, external test cohort = 87) from three centers. 1.5-T/3.0-T, fast/turbo spin-echo T2-weighted, spin-echo echo-planar diffusion-weighted, contrast-enhanced three-dimensional gradient-recalled-echo T1-weighted with extracellular agents (Gd-DTPA, Gd-DTPA-BMA, and Gd-BOPTA). Three-dimensional volume-of-interest of HCC was contoured on portal venous phase, then coregistered with precontrast and late arterial phases. Subtypes were identified using non-negative matrix factorization by analyzing radiomics features from volume-of-interests, and correlated with recurrence. Clinical (demographic and laboratory data), pathological, and radiologic features were compared across subtypes. Among clinical, radiologic features and subtypes, variables with variance inflation factor above 10 were excluded. Variables (P < 0.10) in univariate Cox regression were included in stepwise multivariate analysis. Three recurrence estimation models were built: clinical-radiologic model, subtype model, hybrid model integrating clinical-radiologic characteristics, and subtypes. Mann-Whitney U test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, chi-square test, Fisher's exact test, Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank test, concordance index (C-index). Significance level: P < 0.05. Two subtypes were identified across three cohorts (subtype 1:subtype 2 of 86:127, 60:80, and 36:51, respectively). Subtype 1 showed higher microvascular invasion (MVI)-positive rates (53%-57% vs. 26%-31%), and worse recurrence-free survival. Hazard ratio (HR) for the subtype is 6.10 in subtype model. Clinical-radiologic model included alpha-fetoprotein (HR: 3.01), macrovascular invasion (HR: 2.32), nonsmooth tumor margin (HR: 1.81), rim enhancement (HR: 3.13), and intratumoral artery (HR: 2.21). Hybrid model included alpha-fetoprotein (HR: 2.70), nonsmooth tumor margin (HR: 1.51), rim enhancement (HR: 3.25), and subtypes (HR: 5.34). Subtype model was comparable to clinical-radiologic model (C-index: 0.71-0.73 vs. 0.71-0.73), but hybrid model outperformed both (C-index: 0.77-0.79).

A dataset comprising 3047 instances of suspected irrational medication prescriptions was collected from a sample of 1318 orthopedic perioperative patients from April 2019 to March 2022. Four machine learning models were employed to forecast irrational prescriptions, following which, the performance of each model was meticulously assessed. Subsequently, a thorough variable importance analysis was conducted on the model that performed the best predictive capabilities. Thereafter, the efficacy of integrating this optimal model into the existing audit prescription process was rigorously evaluated. Of the models utilized in this study, the RF model yielded the highest AUC of 92%, whereas the NB model presented the lowest AUC of 68%. Also, the RF model boasted the most robust performance in terms of PPV, reaching 82.4%, and NPV, reaching 86.6%. The ANN and the XGBoost model were neck and neck, with the ANN slightly edging out with a higher PPV of 95.9%, while the XGBoost model boasted an impressive NPV of 98.2%. The RF model singled out the following five factors as the most influential in predicting irrational prescriptions: the type of drug, the type of surgery, the number of comorbidities, the date of surgery after hospitalization, as well as the associated hospital and drug costs. The RF model showcased significantly high level of proficiency in predicting irrational prescriptions among orthopedic perioperative patients, outperforming other models by a considerable margin. It effectively enhanced the efficiency of pharmacist interventions, displaying outstanding performance in assisting pharmacists to intervene with irrational prescriptions.","2025","Expert opinion on drug safety"

Of the 480 admitted patients, 51 developed AKI stage 1 or 2 within 7 days of admission and underwent FST. Nine of these patients were furosemide non-responsive. Thirteen (25.5%) patients (eight of nine from FST non-responsive group) developed stage 3 AKI within 7 days of FST, nine (17.6%) of whom (seven from non-responsive group) required kidney support therapy (KST). FST emerged as a good biomarker for predicting stage 3 AKI and need for KST with area-under-the-curve (AUC) being 0.93 ± 0.05 (95% CI 0.84-1.0) and 0.96 ± 0.03 (95% CI 0.9-1.0), respectively. FST outperformed NGAL and PENK in predicting AKI stage 3 and KST; however, the combination did not improve the diagnostic accuracy.

Using data from 59 124 patients enrolled in the Spanish ABP Monitoring registry, machine-learning approaches (logistic regression, gradient-boosted decision trees, and deep neural networks) and stepwise forward feature selection were used. For the prediction of cardiovascular mortality, deep neural networks yielded the highest clinical performance. The novel mortality prediction models using OBP and ABP outperformed other risk scores. The area under the curve achieved by the novel approach, already when using OBP variables, was significantly higher when compared with the area under the curve of the Framingham risk score, Systemic Coronary Risk Estimation 2, and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease score. However, the prediction of cardiovascular mortality with ABP instead of OBP data significantly increased the area under the curve (0.870 versus 0.865; P=3.61×10-28), accuracy, and specificity, respectively. The prediction of ABP phenotypes (ie, white-coat, ambulatory, and masked hypertension) using clinical characteristics was limited. The receiver operating characteristic curves for cardiovascular mortality using ABP and OBP with deep neural network models outperformed all other risk metrics, indicating the potential for improving current risk scores by applying state-of-the-art machine learning approaches.

First, the placentas on T2WI were manually annotated, and a deep learning model was developed to automatically segment the placentas. Then, the radiomic features were extracted from the placentas and selected by three-step feature selection. In addition, fetus-based measurement features and mother-based clinical features were obtained from ultrasound examinations and medical records, respectively. Finally, a hybrid model based on random forest was constructed by fusing these features, and further compared with models based on other machine learning methods and different feature combinations. The performances of placenta segmentation and FGR assessment were evaluated by Dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC), respectively.

We conducted a multicenter cohort study of patients with an anterior circulation AIS undergoing EVT. The volume of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was extracted from baseline and 24-hour follow-up CT using an automated algorithm. The severity of CED was quantified by the percentage reduction in CSF volume between CT scans (∆CSF). The primary endpoint was a shift towards an unfavorable outcome, assessed by modified Rankin Scale (mRS) score at 3 months. Multivariable ordinal logistic regression analyses were performed. The ∆CSF threshold that predicted unfavorable outcome was selected using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis. We analyzed 201 patients (mean age 72.7 years, 47.8% women) in whom CED was assessable for 85.6%. Higher systolic blood pressure during EVT and failure to achieve modified Thrombolysis In Cerebral Infarction (mTICI) 3 were found to be independent predictors of greater CED. ∆CSF was independently associated with the probability of a one-point worsening in the mRS score (common odds ratio (cOR) 1.05, 95% CI 1.03 to 1.08) after adjusting for age, baseline mRS, National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS), and number of passes.

Natural language processing could be applied to real-time transcriptions of audio recordings made during procedures in order to classify sedation states that involve movement and pain, which could then be integrated into clinical documentation systems. The aim of this study was to determine whether natural language processing algorithms will work with sufficient accuracy to detect sedation states during procedural sedation. A prospective observational study was conducted. Audio recordings from consenting participants undergoing elective procedures performed in the interventional radiology suite at a large academic hospital were transcribed using an automated speech recognition model.

The Ensemble model showed a similarly high AUC-ROC of 0.96, but lower F1 score of 0.79, precision of 0.83, and recall of 0.77. The BOW approach achieved an AUC-ROC of 0.97 and the F1 score was 0.7, precision was 0.83 and recall was 0.66. The transformer-based architecture using the RoBERTa pre-trained model achieved the best classification performance. Further research is required to confirm the that this natural language processing pipeline can accurately perform text classifications with real-time audio data to allow for automated sedation state assessments. Automating sedation state assessments using natural language processing pipelines would allow for more timely documentation of the care received by sedated patients, and, at the same time, decrease documentation burden for clinicians. Downstream applications can also be generated from the classifications, including for example real-time visualizations of sedation state, which may facilitate improved communication of the adequacy of the sedation between clinicians, who may be performing supervision remotely. Also, accumulation of sedation state assessments from multiple procedures may reveal insights into the efficacy of particular sedative medications or identify procedures where the current approach for sedation and analgesia is not optimal (i.e. a significant amount of time spent in ""pain"" or ""movement"" sedation states).","2025","Journal of nursing scholarship : an official publication of Sigma Theta Tau International Honor Society of Nursing"

Extensive metabolic alterations are involved in carcinogenesis and could, therefore, serve as a reliable prognostic phenotype. Our study aimed to develop a prognosis signature and explore the relationship between metabolic characteristic-related signature and immune infiltration in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). TCGA-LUAD and GSE31210 datasets were used as a training set and a validation set, respectively. A total of 513 LUAD samples collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA-LUAD) were used as a training dataset. Molecular subtypes were classified by consensus clustering, and prognostic genes related to metabolism were analyzed based on Differentially Expressed Genes (DEGs), Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network, the univariate/multivariate- and Lasso- Cox regression analysis. Two molecular subtypes with significant survival differences were divided by the metabolism gene sets. The DEGs between the two subtypes were identified by integrated analysis and then used to develop an 8-gene signature (TTK, TOP2A, KIF15, DLGAP5, PLK1, PTTG1, ECT2, and ANLN) for predicting LUAD prognosis. Overexpression of the 8 genes was significantly correlated with worse prognostic outcomes. RiskScore was an independent factor that could divide LUAD patients into low- and high-risk groups. Specifically, high-risk patients had poorer prognoses and higher immune escape. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve showed strong performance of the RiskScore model in estimating 1-, 3- and 5-year survival in both training and validation sets. Finally, an optimized nomogram model was developed and contributed the most to the prognostic prediction in LUAD. The current model could help effectively identify high-risk patients and suggest the most effective drug and treatment candidates for patients with LUAD.","2025","Current medicinal chemistry"

In this study, 205 AAA patients and 205 age- and sex-matched controls were included to detect the serum ATG4B levels. Meanwhile, abdominal aortic specimens from 24 AAA patients and 6 human organ donors were collected to evaluate the mRNA and in situ protein expression of ATG4B. We observed significantly higher ATG4B mRNA and protein expression levels in AAA group compared to those in control group, with a positive correlation between mRNA levels and serum/in situ protein levels (serum, r = 0.518, P = 0.010; in situ, r = 0.453, P = 0.026). Serum ATG4B exhibited the diagnostic potential for AAA (AUC = 0.702, sensitivity = 75.6%) and intraluminal thrombus recognition (AUC = 0.602, sensitivity = 67.9%). Logistic regression revealed a significant association between elevated serum ATG4B and an increased risk of AAA and intraluminal thrombus formation. Deceased patients displayed higher baseline serum ATG4B levels, which could predict postoperative mortality (HR = 1.028, 95%CI = 1.007-1.049, P = 0.009, AUC = 0.612, sensitivity = 84.6%). The bioinformatics analysis suggested that ATG4B may modulate cellular autophagy and influence pathways associated with inflammation, lipid metabolism, or apoptosis, thereby contributing to the occurrence and development of AAA. The drug-gene interaction network identified 13 potential therapeutic drugs targeting ATG4B. In conclusion, ATG4B may serve as a promising biomarker for the diagnosis and prognostic assessment of AAA patients and play a key role in the pathogenesis of AAA.","2025","Molecular and cellular biochemistry"

Novel prognostic signatures contribute to the mining of novel biomarkers, which are essential for the construction of a precision medicine system for LIHC and the improvement of survival. Tyrosine metabolism plays a critical role in the initiation and development of LIHC. Based on the tyrosine metabolism-related characteristics in LIHC, this study developed a risk signature to improve the prognostic prediction of patients with LIHC. To investigate the correlation between tyrosine metabolism and progression of LIHC and to develop a tyrosine metabolism-related prognostic model. Gene expression and clinicopathological information of LIHC were obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database. Distinct subtypes of LIHC were classified by performing consensus cluster analysis on the tyrosine metabolism-related genes. Univariate and Lasso Cox regression were used to develop a RiskScore prognosis model. Kaplan-Meier (KM) survival analysis with log-rank test and area under the curve (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) were employed in the prognostic evaluation and prediction validation. Immune infiltration, tyrosine metabolism score, and pathway enrichment were evaluated using single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA). Finally, a nomogram model was developed with the RiskScore and other clinicopathological features. Based on the tyrosine metabolism genes in the TCGA cohort, we identified 3 tyrosine metabolism-related subtypes showing significant prognostic differences. Four candidate genes selected from the common differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the 3 subtypes were used to develop a RiskScore model, which could effectively divide LIHC patients into high- and lowrisk groups. In both the training and validation sets, high-risk patients tended to have worse overall survival, less active immunotherapy response, higher immune infiltration and clinical grade, and higher oxidative, fatty, and xenobiotic metabolism pathways. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the RiskScore was an independent indicator for the prognosis of LIHC. The results from pan-- cancer analysis also supported that the RiskScore had a strong prognostic performance in other cancers. The nomogram demonstrated that the RiskScore contributed the most to the prediction of LIHC prognosis. Our study developed a tyrosine metabolism-related risk model that performed well in survival prediction, showing the potential to serve as an independent prognostic predictor for LIHC treatment.","2025","Current medicinal chemistry"

On the other hand, a negative result is a strong indication that the drug and/or the drug metabolites are not present in the sample and that confirmatory analyses are not necessary. Consequently, a negative IA result must have forensic validity since it can be admitted in court during a trial. Screening cutoffs for the analysis of hair samples using immunoassays (IAs) were retrospectively optimized based on the Society of Hair Testing (SoHT) confirmation cutoffs and the utility of the test for forensic applications was discussed. Hair samples taken from 150 patients with a history of drug addiction were analyzed with ILab 650, Werfen (Milan, Italy) using DRI® reagents. Confirmatory analyses were subsequently performed using the ACQUITY UPLC® System, Waters Corporation (Milford, USA). Screening cutoffs were retrospectively optimized using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. A total of 162 single positive results were obtained for confirmatory analysis (10 for amphetamines/methamphetamines, 11 for MDMA, 37 for cocaine, 40 for THC, 33 for methadone, and 31 for opiates). The optimized screening cutoffs were 0.27 IA ng/mg for amphetamines, 0.51 IA ng/mg for MDMA, 0.59 IA ng/mg for cocaine, 0.14 IA ng/mg for cannabinoids, 0.63 IA ng/mg for methadone, and 0.26 IA ng/mg for opiates. An area under the curve (AUC) greater than 0.95 was obtained with very high sensitivity and specificity for all drugs. The presented screening method proved to be a useful technique on hair samples for the classes of drugs most commonly found in Italy and Europe and can be applied to forensic analysis.","2025","Advances in clinical and experimental medicine : official organ Wroclaw Medical University"

This study aimed to compare the intraprocedural ablation characteristics of two cryoballoons, Arctic Front Advance Pro™ (AFA-Pro, Medtronic) and POLARx™ (Boston Scientific). In this retrospective single-center study, 230 symptomatic paroxysmal or persistent AF patients underwent CB ablation with either AFA-Pro or POLARx. Propensity-score matching resulted in two cohorts of 114 patients each. Baseline and procedural characteristics were comparable between both CBs. POLARx achieved lower minimal temperatures (e.g., left superior pulmonary vein, LSPV: AFA-Pro - 49.0 °C vs. POLARx - 59.5 °C) and lower temperatures at time-to-isolation (TTI). Additionally, POLARx reached lower temperatures faster, as evidenced by lower temperatures after 40 and 60 s, and a larger mean temperature change between 20 and 40 s. POLARx also had a greater area under the curve below 0 °C and a longer thawing phase. Both CBs achieved comparable high rates of final PV-isolation. TTI, minimal esophagus temperature, and first-pass isolation rates were similar between groups. Periprocedural complications, including phrenic nerve injuries, were comparable. Troponin levels in the left atrium were elevated with both systems. Values and change in troponin were numerically higher in the POLARx group (delta troponin: AFA-Pro 36.3 (26.4, 125.4) ng/L vs. POLARx 104.9 (49.5, 122.2) ng/L), p = 0.077). AFA-Pro and POLARx are both highly effective and safe CB systems for PVI. POLARx exhibited significant faster and lower freezing characteristics, and numerically higher troponin levels might indicate greater myocardial injury. However, these differences did not translate into improved performance, procedural efficiency, or safety.","2025","Clinical research in cardiology : official journal of the German Cardiac Society"

Ninety MCI subjects and eighty-eight well-matched healthy controls (HCs) were selected. Twelve hippocampal subregions volume and texture features were extracted using Freesurfer and MaZda based on T1 weighted MRI. Then, two-sample t-test and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (LASSO) regression were developed to select a subset of the original features. Support vector machine (SVM) was used to perform the classification task and the area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity, specificity and accuracy were calculated to evaluate the diagnostic efficacy of the model. The volume features with high discriminative power were mainly located in the bilateral CA1 and CA4, while texture feature were gray-level non-uniformity, run length non-uniformity and fraction. Our model based on hippocampal subregions volume and texture features achieved better classification performance with an AUC of 0.90. The volume and texture of hippocampal subregions can be utilized for the diagnosis of MCI. Moreover, we found that the features that contributed most to the model were mainly textural features, followed by volume. These results may guide future studies using structural scans to classify patients with MCI.","2025","Experimental aging research"

Data from the multinational AS-PROSE study was used. Thresholds to determine whether patients consider themselves in an 'unacceptable work state' were calculated at baseline for four instruments assessing presenteeism and two health outcomes specific for r-axSpA. Different approaches derived from the receiver operating characteristic methodology were used. Validity of the optimal thresholds was tested across contextual factors and for predicting future AWO over 12 months. Of 366 working patients, 15% reported an unacceptable work state; 6% experienced at least one AWO in 12 months. Optimal thresholds were: WPAI-presenteeism ≥40 (AUC 0.85), QQ-method <97 (0.76), WALS ≥0.75 (AUC 0.87), WLQ-25 ≥ 29 (AUC 0.85). BASDAI and BASFI performed similarly to the presenteeism instruments: ≥4.7 (AUC 0.82) and ≥3.5 (AUC 0.79), respectively. Thresholds for WALS and WLQ-25 were stable across contextual factors, while for all other instruments they overestimated unacceptable work state in lower educated persons. Proposed thresholds could also predict future AWO, although with lower performance, especially for QQ-method, BASDAI and BASFI. Thresholds of measurement instruments for presenteeism and health status to identify unacceptable work state have been established. These thresholds can help in daily clinical practice to provide work-related support to r-axSpA patients at risk for AWO.","2025","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)"

We sought to develop and validate an ILD risk model in a large, multicentre, prospective RA cohort. Participants in the Veterans Affairs RA (VARA) registry were genotyped for 12 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis. ILD was validated through systematic record review. A genetic risk score (GRS) was computed from minor alleles weighted by effect size with ILD, using backward selection. The GRS was combined with clinical risk factors within a logistic regression model. Internal validation was completed using bootstrapping, and model performance was assessed by the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC). Of 2386 participants (89% male, mean age 69.5 years), 9.4% had ILD. Following backward selection, five SNPs contributed to the GRS. The GRS and clinical factors outperformed clinical factors alone in discriminating ILD (AUC 0.675 vs 0.635, P < 0.001). The shrinkage-corrected performance for combined and clinical-only models was 0.667 (95% CI 0.628, 0.712) and 0.623 (95% CI 0.584, 0.651), respectively. Twenty percent of the cohort had a combined risk score below a cut-point with >90% sensitivity. A clinical and genetic risk model discriminated ILD in a large, multicentre RA cohort better than a clinical-only model, excluding 20% of the cohort from low-yield testing. These results demonstrate the potential utility of a GRS in RA-ILD and support further investigation into individualized risk stratification and screening.","2025","Rheumatology (Oxford, England)"

The data were collected from 154 pairs of children and their parents, who sought medical attention for suspected autism at Peking University Sixth Hospital. The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value, positive likelihood ratio, negative likelihood ratio, Youden index, and area under the receiver operating characteristics curves (AUC) of the CABS and ABC were calculated and compared using recommended cut-off values from initial papers. The optimal cut-off values for CABS and ABC were determined according to the maximum Youden index. The ABC performed better than the CABS in screening autistic persons. Specifically, the ABC demonstrated higher sensitivity than the CABS in identifying children with ASD, while the CABS exhibited superior specificity compared to the ABC. According to the maximum Youden index, the optimal cut-off value was determined to be 13 for CABS and 62 for ABC. The ABC exhibits higher sensitivity and overall performance in screening individuals with ASD compared to the CABS. The ABC is more suitable as a screening tool for caregivers in both domestic and clinical settings, while the CABS may be utilized when evaluation time or medical resources are limited due to its shorter completion time and fewer items.","2025","Journal of autism and developmental disorders"

A total of 4,176 participants from the Gangnam Severance Medical Cohort (2006-2021), which consisted of participants who had at least one disease related to metabolic derangements including diabetes mellitus, fatty liver, and hypertension were enrolled and atherogenic indices (lipid ratios including atherogenic index of plasma [AIP]) were assessed. The study endpoint was a composite kidney outcome (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR] of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2 in at least two measurements in participants with baseline eGFR of ≥60 mL/min/1.73 m2; ≥30% decrease in eGFR from baseline in participants with baseline eGFR of <60 mL/min/1.73 m2; or the initiation of dialysis or kidney transplantation). During a median follow-up of 6.0 years (interquartile range, 2.5-11.0 years), 1,266 composite kidney outcomes (30.3%) occurred. The highest quartile of AIP showed a higher risk of composite kidney outcome than the lowest quartile (hazard ratio [HR], 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12-1.54). This association was consistent when the AIP was treated as a continuous variable (HR per 1.0 increase, 1.51; 95% CI, 1.21-1.88). However, other atherogenic indices did not show significant associations with composite kidney outcome. Adding AIP to the traditional risk model to predict composite kidney outcomes significantly improved the C-index, net reclassification index, and integrated discrimination improvement. The association between high AIP and an increased risk of composite kidney outcome was consistent regardless of subgroup. High AIP was associated with an increased risk of CKD in adults with metabolic derangements.","2025","Kidney research and clinical practice"

We applied machine learning to predict patient outcomes associated with high morbidity and mortality after cardiac surgery and identified the importance of variables to the derived model's performance. We applied machine learning to the Society of Thoracic Surgeons Adult Cardiac Surgery Database to predict postoperative hemorrhage requiring reoperation, venous thromboembolism (VTE), and stroke. We used permutation feature importance to identify variables important to model performance and a misclassification analysis to study the limitations of the model. The study dataset included 662,772 subjects who underwent cardiac surgery between 2015 and 2017 and 240 variables. Hemorrhage requiring reoperation, VTE, and stroke occurred in 2.9%, 1.2%, and 2.0% of subjects, respectively. The model performed remarkably well at predicting all 3 complications (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, 0.92-0.97). Preoperative and intraoperative variables were not important to model performance; instead, performance for the prediction of all 3 outcomes was driven primarily by several postoperative variables, including known risk factors for the complications, such as mechanical ventilation and new onset of postoperative arrhythmias. Many of the postoperative variables important to model performance also increased the risk of subject misclassification, indicating internal validity. A machine learning model accurately and reliably predicts patient outcomes following cardiac surgery. Postoperative, as opposed to preoperative or intraoperative variables, are important to model performance. Interventions targeting this period, including minimizing the duration of mechanical ventilation and early treatment of new-onset postoperative arrhythmias, may help lower the risk of these complications.","2025","The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery"

The study cohort comprised 1323 patients from 9 institutions who underwent an elective aortic arch procedure between 2002 and 2021. A total of 69 variables were used in developing a logistic regression and XGBoost ML model trained for binary classification of mortality and stroke. Shapely additive explanations (SHAP) values were studied to determine the importance of intraoperative decisions. During the study period, 3.9% of patients died and 5.4% experienced stroke. XGBoost (area under the curve [AUC], 0.77 for death, 0.87 for stroke) demonstrated better discrimination than logistic regression (AUC, 0.65 for death, 0.75 for stroke). From SHAP analysis, intraoperative decisions are 3 of the top 20 predictors of death and 6 of the top 20 predictors of stroke. Predictor weights are patient-specific and reflect the patient's preoperative characteristics and other intraoperative decisions. Patient-level simulation also demonstrates the variable contribution of each decision in the context of the other choices that are made. Using ML, we can more accurately identify patients at risk of death and stroke, as well as the strategy that better reduces the risk of adverse events compared to traditional prediction models. Operative decisions made may be tailored based on a patient's specific characteristics, allowing for maximized, personalized benefit.","2025","The Journal of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery"
